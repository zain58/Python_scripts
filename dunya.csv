In a letter to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the UK Christian Community leader James Shera said, ""We are deeply concerned at several interlinked troubling recent developments in Indian occupied Jammu & Kashmir"".
James Shera s letter said, ""We have noted increased ceasefire violations across Line of Control, additional deployment of 38,000 troops, heightened state-sponsored repression against the defenseless Kashmiris, and reports regarding attempts to abrogate articles 35-A and 370 of the Indian Constitution, which defines the residents of IOK and limits subjects like property ownership and state citizenship to the indigenous Kashmiris of the area.
By abolishing Article -35, India plans to change the demographic structure of IOK. According to the Kashmiris in IOK, India has been systematically trying to alter the demography with ulterior motives"".
""This would be a blatant violation of the UN Security Council s resolutions on Kashmir dispute and would seriously jeopardise regional peace and security"", Shera remarked.
James Shera further said that reportedly, there has been wide-spread anxiety and fear in IOK.
""Hindu pilgrims for Amaranth Yatara, tourists and students have been advised to leave the IOK forthwith, which suggests that PM Modi led BJP government is up to something drastic"", James Shera said.
The UK Christian Community leader said that political parties in IOK had voiced their serious concern and expressed strong opposition to any legal or administrative measures aimed at changing the ""special status"" of the IOK.
James Shera said the Indian government had failed to clarify its position behind these extraordinary measures, adding the Indian government had also not taken any measures to calm down the situation.
James Shera further said reportedly, in addition to the ceasefire violations across LOC, in the latest provocation, Indian army has used cluster ammunition against civilian population in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, leading to the death of two civilians including a 4-years child and a dozen injuries which was a highly condemnable act.

It violated international law and was in contravention of the relevant convention"".

SRINAGAR (Dunya News) – Indian-occupied Kashmir s former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah – who were placed under house arrest late last evening – have been arrested.
Mehbooba Mufti has been taken to a state guest house. She was put under house arrest last night as the authorities clamped restrictions under Section 144 of CrPC.

In a statement this morning after Union Home Minister Amit Shah s announcement in parliament, Abdullah said: ""The scrapping of Articles 370 and 35A raise fundamental questions on the State s accession because that was done on the very terms enunciated in these Articles.

Six things to know about occupied Kashmir's changed status,"
NEW DELHI (Web Desk/AFP) - Amid escalating tension in occupied Kashmir following deployment of tens of thousands of additional troops, the Indian government has ended special status of the valley while scrapping articles 35A and 370 of the Constitution.
Here are six things to know about the unprecedented move:

What is Article 370?

The article, which came into effect in 1949, exempted Jammu and Kashmir state from the Indian constitution. The provision gave Kashmir’s assembly the power to vet national laws passed by New Delhi. It also gave the state a separate constitution and a flag.
Under the provision, Indians outside the state were blocked from permanently settling, buying land, holding local government jobs and securing education scholarships.
Under the changed status, the region will now be governed by the laws applicable to other Indian citizens.

What is Article 35A?

Article 35A was introduced through a presidential order in 1954 to continue the old provisions of the territory regulations under Article 370 of the Indian constitution.
The article permits the local legislature in Indian-occupied Kashmir to define permanent residents of the region.
It forbids outsiders from permanently settling, buying land, holding local government jobs or winning education scholarships in the region.
The article, referred to as the Permanent Residents Law, also bars female residents of Jammu and Kashmir from property rights in the event that they marry a person from outside the state. The provision also extends to such women’s children.

Why now?

The Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi enjoys a sizeable majority in parliament after dominating the polls in the April-May elections.
Modi’s right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) can now push through parliament its key policy goals. This includes the BJP’s long-held promise to scrap Article 370.
Critics say the BJP’s latest move is a part of its agenda to please core supporters and win more votes by stoking Hindu nationalist fervour.
The move is in line with its approach towards Kashmir and Pakistan, which also claims the former Himalayan kingdom.

Significance

The special status, which has been in place since May 14, 1954, has helped Kashmiri Muslims and other communities preserve their strong sense of culture.
The ditching of the status has highlighted long-running fears that the local way of life and customs could be lost amid migration from other parts of the country.
Analysts say the Indian government wants to change the region’s demographics by allowing non-Kashmiris, mostly Hindus, to buy land and settle there permanently.
It is also likely to worsen the simmering and bloody rebellion in Kashmir, where an insurgency over the past three decades has left more than 70,000 dead, mainly civilians.

International ramifications

The decision has a direct impact on relations between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan. Kashmir has been divided between the neighboring countries since 1947 and they have fought two out of three wars over the region.
In February the countries were on the brink of war after India launched air raids on Pakistan over a deadly bombing in Kashmir that killed 40 paramilitary troops.
Pakistan launched counter air strikes with the retaliations, capturing Indian Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman.
The move could also affect the United States’ move to exit Afghanistan after an 18-year war, launched following the 2001 terror attacks.
Pakistan has been a key facilitator in direct talks between Washington and the Taliban in Afghanistan over the exit plans.
US President Donald Trump recently offered to mediate between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, but New Delhi has long insisted the issue can only be resolved bilaterally.

What’s next?

Up next is a bill proposing splitting the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir division, and Ladakh.
This means the entire region would lose its autonomous status and come under the direct rule of New Delhi.
The Jammu and Kashmir division will have its own assembly and elections but the national government will have control of local laws, including the maintenance of public order.
The tinderbox region was placed under a massive security lockdown and communications were cut ahead of Monday’s announcement, on fears it would trigger fresh unrest.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-05-19/news_big_images/503824_63572792.jpg,pakistan,"

Pakistanis come out in unison to show their support for the Kashmiri brethren,"
(Web Desk) – Indian violation of international law and continuation of its human rights atrocities have stepped up a notch; to abrogate the special status of the disputed territory of IOK since Pak-India independence has raised an uproar in the country.
Kashmir has been a nuclear flashpoint between the arch rivals India and Pakistan for decades, several wars have been fought over the territorial dispute.
Kashmir has been regarded the jugular vein of Pakistan since its inception by the father of the nation Quaid-e-Azam and the support for the occupied people of the valley runs high in the blood of all Pakistanis young or old, across generations.
India’s blatant disregard for UN resolutions and the recent attempts of the Modi govt to repeal the special status of Kashmiris by sending additional troops and cutting off the peoples connection with the rest of world has created a commotion and people are raising their voice in the support of their Kashmiri brethren in unison regardless of political, cultural and ethnic divide.

Will keep highlighting Kashmir issue on every global forum: Firdous Ashiq Awan,"
ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) - Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan on Monday said that Kashmir is calling for aid from Human Rights Council and global powers as Indian unilateral malicious act openly violated the United Nation Security Council‘s resolutions.
Talking to media representatives in Islamabad, she said that the people of Kashmir are making great sacrifices in the struggle for freedom. She expressed that Pakistan salutes the martyrs of freedom movement. “Kashmir runs like blood in our body”, she added.
Firdous Awan asserted that this move by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has exposed fake secularism of the India. India acted dishonestly and put the region‘s peace at stake, she added. “India has emerged as the enemy of the region‘s development”.
She expressed that Pakistan and Kashmiris already have rejected the black law of India whereas India’s poisonous thinking played with peace in the region. “The world knows now who is the peacekeeper and who is the troublemaker,” she added.
Earlier today, amid escalating tension in occupied Kashmir following deployment of tens of thousands of additional troops, the Indian government ended special status of the valley while scrapping articles 35A and 370 of the Constitution.
In a malicious attempt to turn Muslim majority into minority in occupied Kashmir, the Indian president has signed a four-point amendment decree in this regard.
According to details, the announcement was made by Indian Home Minister Amit Shah during his address in Rajya Sabha, upper house of Indian parliament. Shah said, “Kashmir will no longer be a state. It will be divided into two union territories – Kashmir, which will have a legislature, and Ladakh, which will be without a legislature.""
He also told that the valley would be re-organized geographically.”
The revocation of the articles has allowed other non-Muslim Indian citizens to buy land in the valley while a separate legislative assembly will be established there for its own laws. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-05-19/news_big_images/503806_90425646.jpg,pakistan,She expressed that Pakistan and Kashmiris already have rejected the black law of India whereas India’s poisonous thinking played with peace in the region.,negative

Air strike kills 42 in southern Libya town,"
TRIPOLI (AFP) - At least 42 people were killed and dozens wounded in an air strike targeting a town hall meeting in southern Libya, a local official and the UN-recognised government said Monday, accusing forces of military strongman Khalifa Haftar.
The Government of National Accord (GNA) said Sunday s raid struck the residential district of Qalaa in the town of Murzuq.
The air raid left ""42 dead and more than 60 injured, 30 of them critically,"" municipal council official Ibrahim Omar told AFP.
He said a government building at which more than 200 local dignitaries were gathered ""to settle social differences"" was targeted three times.
""No armed or wanted people were among them... Haftar bombed unarmed civilians,"" he said, calling for humanitarian aid since the local hospital could not cope with the high number of casualties.
The GNA condemned the attack on its Facebook page, also blaming it on Haftar s forces.
Haftar, who seized swathes of southern Libya earlier in the year, has been battling since April to oust pro-GNA forces from the capital Tripoli.
The GNA urged the UN s Libya mission and international community ""to carry out an investigation into the crimes committed by Haftar s militias in Murzuq"".
There was no immediate comment on the raid from Haftar s self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA).
With its 50,000 inhabitants, mostly from the Toubou ethnic group, and its ancient fortress, the oasis town is located almost 900 kilometres (550 miles) by road south of Tripoli.
The Toubou have remained at odds with rival Arab tribes which have rallied with Haftar s forces who took control of the region in January in an operation to ""purge it of terrorists and criminals"".
The European Union, which has previously called for those breaching international law in Libya to be brought to justice, condemned the strike.
""Indiscriminate attacks on densely populated residential areas may amount to war crimes and must cease immediately,"" said EU spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic.
With fighting for Tripoli stalled on the ground after initial advances by Haftar s forces, the two sides have increasingly taken their fight to the skies with warplanes and drones.
Aviation officials said Monday that a Libyan passenger plane had narrowly escaped being hit by incoming fire as it landed at Tripoli s sole functioning airport.
""The crew on the flight from Benghazi, which was carrying 124 passengers, avoided being hit by bombing on Mitiga International Airport"" on Sunday, the airport s management wrote on Facebook.
The incident forced the airport to close to air traffic and re-route flights to Misrata, some 200 kilometres further east, until late Sunday night.
The origin of the bombs was not clear, and no side has yet claimed responsibility.
UN envoy Ghassan Salame last week warned the Security Council of ""the increasing frequency of attacks"" on Mitiga airport, controlled by pro-GNA forces.
""Several of these attacks have come perilously close to hitting civilian aircraft with passengers on board,"" he said.
On Sunday, his office condemned the ""repeated indiscriminate shelling"" of Mitiga, ""the only indispensable functioning airport available for use by millions of civilians"" and aid deliveries.
Mitiga has closed several times since the start of the assault by Haftar, who has accused pro-GNA forces of using it for military purposes including as a launch site for Turkish attack drones.
Located east of Tripoli, Mitiga is a former military airbase that has been used by civilian traffic since Tripoli s international airport suffered severe damage during fighting in 2014.
The World Health Organization says the battle for Tripoli has left nearly 1,100 people dead and wounded more than 5,750, while forcing more than 100,000 civilians to flee their homes.
Libya has been wracked by chaos since the 2011 uprising that killed president Moamer Kadhafi.
Rival administrations and militias are vying for power, with the Tripoli-based GNA at odds with a parallel administration based in the east and backed by Haftar.

Putin urges new arms talks with US to avoid 'chaos',"
MOSCOW (AFP) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday urged the United States to begin new arms talks after the collapse of a Cold War nuclear pact between the two world powers.
Moscow and Washington tore up the Intermediate Range Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty on Friday, triggering fears of a new arms race.
""In order to avoid chaos that has no rules, limits and laws, one needs to once again weigh all possible dangerous consequences and start serious dialogue without any ambiguities,"" Putin said in a statement.
""We are ready for it.""
Moscow has blamed Washington for unilaterally ending the 1987 treaty which was signed by US president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
The agreement limited the use of conventional and nuclear missiles with ranges of 500 to 5,500 kilometres (310 to 3,420 miles).
Washington and NATO accused Russia of developing the new 9M729 missile which they say violates the treaty, but Russia says its range falls short of 500 kilometres
Putin said Monday that if Russia receives information about US development of new missiles, it ""will be forced to begin the full-scale development of similar missiles"".
Russia ""will not deploy them in relevant regions until American-made missiles are deployed there,"" Putin said.
Unless there are new talks about strategic security, ""this scenario means restarting an uncontrolled arms race,"" he added.
US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said at the weekend that he would like to deploy the new intermediate-range missiles in Asia, but denied that this would spark an arms race as the weapons are not nuclear.
""Right now, we don t have plans to build nuclear-tipped INF range weapons,"" he said. ""So I don t see an arms race happening.""
The INF treaty was considered a cornerstone of global arms control architecture, but Washington has long called it obsolete due to non-signatories like China being free to develop their own weapons.
Putin on Monday accused the US of ""seriously complicating the situation in the world and creating fundamental risks for all"" by pulling out of the treaty.
Washington launched a six-month withdrawal procedure for leaving the treaty in February, and Moscow followed soon after.
Any new treaty to counter the build-up of nuclear missiles would have to include China, US President Donald Trump said last week.
The other key arms deal between Russia and the US is the New START treaty which keeps the nuclear arsenals of both countries well below their Cold War peak.
The deal expires in 2021 and it is likely not to be renewed amid the current chill in US-Russian relations, experts say.
The US and Russia own more than 90 percent of global nuclear stockpiles, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, a US think tank.

Hong Kong unrest spreads as leader warns city on brink,"
HONG KONG (AFP) - Hong Kong s unrest spread more widely throughout the financial hub Monday as riot police clashed with pro-democracy protesters at multiple locations and the city s leader warned of a ""very dangerous situation"".
The third consecutive night of police-protester confrontations occurred after a rare strike caused transport chaos.
Activists disrupted vital rush-hour commuter train service, held multiple rallies, besieged police stations and launched projectiles at the legislature, while the general strike affected dozens of flights at one of the world s busiest airports.
Police fired tear gas in at least 11 areas across the city, battling to disperse crowds of demonstrators in the most widespread unrest seen during the two months of increasingly violent protests.
The demonstratons were triggered by opposition to a planned law that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, but have evolved into a wider movement for democratic reform and a halt to eroding freedoms.
Earlier Monday, Hong Kong buckled under the strike urged by protesters who wanted to emphasise they still had broad public support.
In a rare public appearance since the crisis began, chief executive Carrie Lam warned protesters she would not cave to their demands.
""(They) have seriously undermined Hong Kong s law and order and are pushing our city, the city that we all love and many of us helped to build, to the verge of a very dangerous situation,"" Lam said.
She later referred to chants by protesters for a ""revolution"", describing this as a challenge to the ""one country, two systems"" framework under which Hong Kong has been ruled since it returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
""I dare say they are trying to destroy Hong Kong,"" said Lam, who was appointed by a pro-Beijing committee.
China s cabinet-level State Council said it planned to hold a press conference on Tuesday.
During Monday s widespread unrest, activists descended on subway stations at morning rush hour, deliberately keeping open doors to stop trains departing and paralysing large parts of a network that millions of people use daily.
They later held simultaneous rallies at seven locations and besieged multiple police stations, stretching the resources of a force that has become a lightning rod for public anger.
The most sustained clashes occurred outside the city s parliament where protesters used giant slingshots to launch bricks and the working class area of Wong Tai Sin, with tear gas fired throughout the day.
In the evening, a group of men armed with long sticks, clashed with protesters in North Point, a neighbourhood where many Chinese migrants live and is known for its strong Beijing ties. They chased and beat protesters, who threw traffic cones and barricades in return.
In a briefing that highlighted the longevity of the protests, police said they had fired more than 1,000 rounds of tear gas and 160 rubber bullets since rallies began on June 9, with 420 people arrested and 139 officers injured so far.
But the protesters remain unbowed.
""Support for the political strike today seems strong and it has been bolstered further by the escalating violence between the police and protesters,"" political analyst Dixon Wong told AFP.
The strike -- a rare occurrence in the finance hub where unions traditionally have little sway -- hit the vital aviation sector.
More than 160 flights at the city s airport were listed as cancelled on Monday. Many were with Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong s flag carrier.
The airline did not give a reason for the cancellations, but its flight attendants union confirmed some of its members had walked out.
Some major roads were also blocked and many shops across the city were shuttered, including big-name fashion outlets in the central commercial district.
The strike led to some scuffles between angry commuters and protesters at crowded subway stations.
One video, verified by AFP, showed a car smashing its way through a protesters  roadblock in the northern town of Yuen Long.
Another showed a taxi ramming protesters who hurled projectiles.
But while some locals were angered by the disruptions, others said they supported the action.
""As long as the government doesn t respond then for sure the movement will escalate,"" a civil servant, who gave his surname as Leung, told AFP as he tried to make his way to work.
Dozens of protesters have been charged with rioting, which carries a jail term of 10 years.

CPJ calls on India to ensure access to internet and communications services in Kashmir,"
NEW YORK (Web Desk) - The Committee to Protect Journalists today expressed alarm at reports of a communication blackout and the arrest of a journalist in Indian-controlled Jammu and Kashmir state amid an escalating political crisis.
Earlier today, the Indian government announced that it would revoke a constitutional provision granting limited governing autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir, and introduced measures that would change Jammu and Kashmir’s administrative status from a state to a union territory, essentially putting it under federal control, according to news reports. The order still needs approval of the ruling-party controlled Parliament, according to The Associated Press report.
The telecommunication blackout is related to the imposition of Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure today across Srinagar, which prohibits an assembly of more than four persons in an area, according to news reports.
The internet disruption began yesterday, and today there were reports of a complete communication blackout, with broadband internet, postpaid mobile internet, mobile voice connections across different telecoms, and landline services all blocked, according to the internet advocacy group NetBlocks, news reports, and an independent researcher who spoke with CPJ but wished to remain unnamed in order to protect a source. Nearly all communications appeared to be cut off after CPJ received a 3:18 a.m. Indian Standard Time message today from a Srinagar-based reporter who wished to remain anonymous for security concerns. The reporter told CPJ that all communication lines in Kashmir were being cut. Since then CPJ’s efforts to contact journalists in Kashmir via messaging apps, emails, social media, and phone calls have almost all failed. Raqib Hameed Naik, reporter for the U.S.-based The Globe Post, was later able to send a message to CPJ from southern Kashmir via landline internet. He said newspapers were unable to distribute today’s issue because of the curfew.
“A large-scale communication disruption at such a crucial time for Kashmir is an egregious violation of citizens’ rights to information from a free press,” said Aliya Iftikhar, senior researcher for CPJ’s Asia program. “We call on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his administration to guarantee that all communication blocks in Kashmir are lifted and that journalists are able to report freely. Communication blocks have no place in a democracy.”
An email sent to the Home Ministry of India, which is responsible for the administration of Jammu and Kashmir, was not immediately answered.
In the past week, the Indian government sent in thousands of additional troops and evacuated tourists and closed schools, putting the region on edge, according to news reports. Several political leaders have been put under house arrest and there is a ban on public meetings or rallies, the administration said in an official order yesterday, according to the Hindustan Times. Business Insider reported that Indian state-owned telecommunications provider BSNL sold satellite phones to some journalists, which would allow them to evade the blackout.
On July 28, Qazi Shibli, a local journalist and editor of news website The Kashmiriyat, was arrested by Jammu and Kashmir police, according to news portal The Kashmir Walla. According to The Kashmir Walla, Shibli is being held for questioning in relation to tweets that included the leaking of an official order regarding the deployment of additional troops to the region. Yesterday, CPJ contacted Shibli’s family, who expressed serious concerns about his health as he suffers from kidney stones. They told CPJ that police have not specified charges against the journalist. The same day CPJ reached out via WhatsApp to Inspector General of Police Swayam Prakash Pani, who promised to look into the matter. Due to the communication disruption, CPJ has been unable to contact Pani again or independently verify if Shibli is still under arrest.

US Afghan envoy praises 'excellent progress' in Taliban talks,"
DOHA (AFP) - The US and the Taliban have made ""excellent progress"" in the latest round of talks in Doha to craft a peace deal, Washington s Afghanistan envoy said on Monday.
The foes have been meeting in Qatar since Saturday for an eighth round of talks to thrash out a historic accord that would slash the US military presence in Afghanistan.
In return, the United States is demanding that the Taliban prevent the country from being used as a safe haven for jihadist groups including Al-Qaeda.
""Building on excellent progress in Kabul last week, I ve spent the last few days in Doha, focused on the remaining issues in completing a potential deal with the Taliban,"" tweeted US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad.
The conclusion of a deal ""would allow for a conditions-based troop withdrawal,"" he wrote adding that ""we have made excellent progress.""
The Taliban did not immediately respond to requests to comment on the talks  progress.
Khalilzad said that he was flying to New Delhi ""for pre-scheduled meetings to further build international consensus in support of the Afghan Peace Process"".
A deal between the two sides could pave the way for direct talks between the government of President Ashraf Ghani, although the insurgents view his administration as illegitimate.
""My team and Taliban representatives will continue to discuss technical details as well as steps and mechanisms required for a succesful implementation of the four-part agreement we ve been working toward since my appointment,"" Khalilzad tweeted.
""Agreement on these details is essential,"" the US envoy added.
The four pillars of any deal would be a US withdrawal from Afghanistan, a commitment by the militants not to shelter jihadists, intra-Afghan dialogue, and a ceasefire.
 

 We re talking 

The US invaded Afghanistan in 2001 and toppled the Taliban, accusing it of harbouring Al-Qaeda jihadists who claimed the September 11 attacks against the US that killed almost 3,000 people.
But despite a rapid conclusion to the conventional phase of the war, the Taliban has waged a formidable insurgency, bogging down US troops for years.
Washington wants to strike a peace deal with the Taliban by the end of this month -- ahead of Afghanistan s presidential election that is slated for September 28.
US President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House last week that ""we ve made a lot of progress. We re talking"".
However, even if the US and the Taliban come to an agreement, massive questions remain over what would follow an accord.
The US has said any withdrawal of its troops would be ""conditions-based"", whereas the Taliban is insisting on a full pullout of foreign forces before making commitments of its own.
Washington sees an agreement with the Taliban as a precursor to the insurgents then striking a peace deal with Afghanistan s government.
The Afghan government has formed a negotiating team for talks with the insurgents that diplomats hope could be held later this month.
The United Nations has said that civilian casualty rates in Afghanistan jumped back to record levels last month, after a dip earlier in the year. More than 1,500 civilians were killed or wounded in the conflict in July, the highest monthly toll so far in 2019 and the deadliest single month since May 2017.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-05-19/news_big_images/503854_71848049.jpg,world,"However, even if the US and the Taliban come to an agreement, massive questions remain over what would follow an accord.",neutral
Putin to Trump: We'll develop new nuclear missiles if you do,"
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Monday that Moscow would be forced to start developing short and intermediate-range land-based nuclear missiles if the United States started doing so after the demise of a landmark arms control treaty.
The United States formally left the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with Russia on Friday after determining that Moscow was violating the treaty and had already deployed at least one banned type of missile, an accusation the Kremlin denies.
The pact banned land-based missiles with a range of between 310 and 3,400 miles (500-5,500 km), reducing the ability of both countries to launch a nuclear strike on short notice.
Putin on Monday held a meeting with his Security Council after which he ordered the defence and foreign ministries and Russia s SVR foreign intelligence service to closely monitor any steps the United States took to develop, produce or deploy missiles banned under the defunct treaty.
""If Russia obtains reliable information that the United States has finished developing these systems and started to produce them, Russia will have no option other than to engage in a full-scale effort to develop similar missiles,"" Putin said in a statement.
In the meantime, he said Russia s arsenal of air and sea-launched missiles combined with its work on developing hypersonic missiles meant it was well placed to offset any threat emanating from the United States.
It was now essential, he added, for Moscow and Washington to resume arms control talks to prevent what he described as an ""unfettered"" arms race breaking out.
""In order to avoid chaos with no rules, restrictions or laws, we need to once more weigh up all the dangerous consequences and launch a serious and meaningful dialogue free from any ambiguity,"" Putin said.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-05-19/news_big_images/503848_23488588.jpg,world,"

UK joins US in Gulf mission after Iran taunts,"
LONDON (AFP) - Britain said Monday it will join forces with the United States to protect merchant vessels in the Gulf amid heightened tensions with Iran, after Tehran taunted Washington that its allies were too ""ashamed"" to join the mission.
Britain s decision to form the joint maritime taskforce with the United States marks a departure in policy under new Prime Minister Boris Johnson, after efforts under his predecessor Theresa  May to form a European-led grouping.
It follows a spate of incidents -- including the seizure of ships -- between Iran and Western powers, in particular Britain and the US, centred on the vital Strait of Hormuz thoroughfare.
""The UK is determined to ensure her shipping is protected from unlawful threats, and for that reason we have today joined the new maritime security mission in the Gulf,"" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said in a statement.
The announcement from Britain s defence ministry did not detail which, if any, other countries would be joining the new naval coalition.
Britain was also at pains to stress that it had not changed its broader policy towards Tehran.
""We remain committed to working with Iran and our international partners to de-escalate the situation and maintain the nuclear deal,"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said.
The announcement came hours after Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Washington was increasingly isolated in its hardline stance against Tehran and its allies were too ""ashamed"" to join its forces in the Gulf.
He also dismissed US calls for talks as a sham, confirming he had turned down an offer to meet President Donald Trump last month despite the threat of US sanctions against him.
""Today the United States is alone in the world and cannot create a coalition,"" he said.
""Friendly countries are too ashamed of being in a coalition with them,"" Zarif told a news conference, saying they had ""brought this situation upon themselves, with law-breaking, by creating tensions and crises.""
 

Germany  not in favour 

Tehran and Washington have been locked in a battle of nerves since last year when Trump withdrew the US from a landmark 2015 deal placing curbs on Iran s nuclear programme and began reimposing sanctions.
Tensions have spiked since the Trump administration began stepping up a campaign of ""maximum pressure"" against Iran.
Drones have been downed and tankers seized by Iranian authorities or mysteriously attacked in Gulf waters, while Britain has detained an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar.
At the height of the crisis, Trump called off air strikes against Iran at the last minute in June after the Islamic republic s forces shot down a US drone.
Iran said on Sunday its forces had seized a ""foreign"" tanker carrying smuggled fuel in what would be the third such seizure in less than a month in Gulf waters -- a conduit for much of the world s crude oil.
Last month the Guards said they had impounded the Panama-flagged MT Riah for alleged fuel smuggling as well as the British-flagged Stena Impero for breaking ""international maritime rules"".
In response to such incidents, the US has been seeking to form a coalition -- dubbed Operation Sentinel -- to guarantee freedom of navigation in the Gulf.
Last month Britain, while still led by former prime minister May, proposed a European-led maritime protection force.
But both plans struggled to find partners, with European countries believed to be reluctant to be dragged into a conflict.
Germany said Monday it was currently ""not in favour"" of joining an American-led coalition.
 

 Left the table 

Meanwhile the US continues to target Iran economically, while holding out the prospect of possible talks.
It imposed sanctions against Zarif on Wednesday --under the same sanctions already applied to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei -- targeting any assets he has in America and squeezing his ability to travel.
Meanwhile however the New Yorker magazine reported that Senator Rand Paul had met Zarif in the US on July 15 and had Trump s blessing when he invited the Iranian minister to go to the White House.
Zarif dismissed as disingenuous US ""claims"" it wants dialogue. ""They were the ones who left the table... Who do they want to negotiate with?"" he said. But Zarif did not rule out talks in the future, saying: ""Even in times of war negotiations will exist.""",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-05-19/news_big_images/503847_98065665.jpg,world,"

July 2019 hottest month globally ever recorded: EU,"
PARIS (AFP) - July 2019 was the hottest month across the globe ever recorded, according to data released Monday by the European Union’s satellite-based Earth observation network.
""While July is usually the warmest month of the year for the globe, according to our data it also was the warmest month recorded globally, by a very small margin,"" Jean-Noel Thepaut, head of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, said in a statement.
""With continued greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting impact on global temperatures, records will continue to be broken in the future.""

Searing heatwaves saw records tumble across Europe last month, with unusually high temperatures within the Arctic Circle as well.
Temperatures averaged across July rose highest compared with a 1981-2010 benchmark in Alaska, Greenland, Siberia, central Asia, Iran and large swathes of Antarctica, Copernicus reported.
Wild fires unprecedented in scope and intensity burned across parts of Siberia and Alaska, releasing more than 100 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere, while Greenland’s ice sheet shed billions of tonnes in melted ice daily.
Africa and Australia were also well above average across most of each continent.
Photo taken on July 24, 2019 shows a dry part of the bed of the River Loire at Montjean-sur-Loire, western France.
Globally, July 2019 was marginally warmer -- by 0.04 degrees Celsius (0.072 Fahrenheit) -- than the previous record-hot month, July 2016.
The new record is all the more notable because the 2016 record followed a strong El Nino, which boosts average global temperates beyond the impact of global warming alone.
El Ninos are naturally occurring weather events triggered by periodic warming -- every three to seven years -- in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

Not your grandfather’s summer

Every month so far in 2019 ranks among the four warmest on record for the month in question, with June being the hottest June measured, the Copernicus team said in a press release.
Accurate temperature records extend into the 19th century, starting around 1880.
The Copernicus service is the first of the world’s major satellite-based climate monitoring networks to report average July temperatures.

The margin of increase is small enough, it noted in a press release, that other networks -- such as the US government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) -- may report temperatures equal to or slightly below the July 2016 record.
""Typically, there is a difference between the values provided by the global temperature datasets of various institutions, and the Copernicus difference between July 2019 and 2016 temperatures is smaller than this margin,"" the agency said in a statement.
""We have always lived through hot summers, but this is not the summer of our youth. This is not your grandfather’s summer,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week, announcing provisional findings from the World Meteorological Organization.
""All of this means that we are on track for the period from 2015 to 2019 to be the five hottest years on record.""

July 2019 will be around 1.2C warmer than the pre-industrial era, according to the data.
Every year in the 21st century except one has been among the hottest on record, a fact that defies explanation without the input of manmade global warming, scientists say.
Europe has endured two exceptionally strong heatwaves in a matter of weeks.
Record highs tumbled across France, with the mercury peaking at 46C on June 28 in the southern town of Verargues. The previous record, set back in 2003, was 44.1C.
The second wave of heat saw Paris’s all-time high pulverised last month: Meteo France measured 42.6C in the French capital on July 25 -- more than 2C hotter than the previous high, set more than 70 years ago.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands all also registered all-time high temperatures. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-05-19/news_big_images/503810_19969780.jpg,world,"Searing heatwaves saw records tumble across Europe last month, with unusually high temperatures within the Arctic Circle as well.",positive
Iraq recovers over $1 bn in stolen state funds,"
BAGHDAD (AFP) - Iraq’s anti-corruption commission said Monday it has recovered $1 billion in money stolen from state coffers in the first six months of the year, in its latest efforts to stem corruption.
The Integrity Commission said 857 arrest warrants had been issued against government officials, of whom 407 had been detained.
Graft is endemic across Iraq, which ranks as the 12th most corrupt country in the world according to Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index.
Since 2004, a year after the US-led invasion that ousted dictator Saddam Hussein, almost $250 billion of public funds has vanished into the pockets of shady politicians and businessmen, according to parliament.
That amount is twice the government’s budget and more than the country’s GDP.
The anti-corruption commission has been struggling to track down money syphoned off from state coffers, including funds earmarked to rebuild the country devastated by decades of conflict.
Last week, it said around $10 million in aid for the displaced in northern Iraq’s Nineveh province, where the Islamic State group was based, had been embezzled by its fugitive ex-governor Nawfel Akoub.
In April, it had said more than $60 million dollars in public funds were embezzled by officials in Mosul -- capital of Nineveh -- close to Akoub, who was sacked in the wake of a ferry sinking that killed 150 people.

Abolishing Article 370 'totally unconstitutional': Indian Punjab CM ,"
CHANDIGARH (Web Desk) – Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday termed Indian government’s step of abolishing Article 370 that gave special status to occupied Kashmir as “totally unconstitutional”.
In a statement, Singh said that the democratic fabric of the nation has been ""ripped apart"" with this ""unprecedented violation of the Constitutional norms"".
He further stated, ""It is a dark day for the Indian democracy.""
""This will set a bad precedent as it would mean that the Centre could re-organise any state in the country by simply imposing President s rule,"" the CM went on to say.  

The reaction came after Indian government ended special status of the occupied Kashmir while scrapping articles 35A and 370 of the Constitution. The Indian president has signed a four-point amendment decree in this regard.
The announcement was made by Indian Home Minister Amit Shah during his address in Rajya Sabha, upper house of Indian parliament.
Shah said, “Kashmir will no longer be a state. It will be divided into two union territories – Kashmir, which will have a legislature, and Ladakh, which will be without a legislature.""

Trump to address nation after US shootings leave 29 dead,"
EL PASO (AFP) - US President Donald Trump will address the nation on Monday after two shootings left 29 people dead and sparked accusations that his rhetoric was part of the problem.
The rampages turned innocent snippets of everyday life into nightmares of bloodshed: 20 people were shot dead while shopping at a crowded Walmart in El Paso, Texas on Saturday morning, and nine more outside a bar in a popular nightlife district in Dayton, Ohio just 13 hours later.
Trump will again find himself in the role of consoler-in-chief after a tragedy -- which he has struggled with in the past -- when he speaks at 10:00 am (1400 GMT).
Following the shootings, Trump said ""hate has no place in our country,"" but he also blamed mental illness for the violence.
""These are really people that are very, very seriously mentally ill,"" he said, despite the fact that police have not confirmed this to be the case.
""We have to get it stopped. This has been going on for years... and years in our country,"" he said.
In Texas, 26 people were wounded, and 27 in Ohio, where the shooter was killed in roughly 30 seconds by police who were patrolling nearby.

100-round drum magazine 


Dayton Police Chief Richard Biehl told a news conference that the quick police response was ""crucial,"" preventing the shooter from entering a bar where ""there would have been... catastrophic injury and loss of life.""
Biehl said the shooter wore a mask and a bullet-proof vest and was armed with an assault rifle fitted with a 100-round drum magazine.
Police named the gunman as a 24-year-old white man called Connor Betts and said his sister was among those killed. She had gone with him to the scene of the shootings.
Six of the nine people shot dead were black, but Biehl said Betts’ motive was still unclear.
In Texas, police said the suspect surrendered on a sidewalk near the scene of the massacre. He was described in media reports as a 21-year-old white man named Patrick Crusius.
He was believed to have posted online a manifesto denouncing a ""Hispanic invasion"" of Texas. El Paso, on the border with Mexico, is majority Latino.

‘Amplifying and condoning’ hate 


Seven of the 20 people killed in the El Paso shooting were Mexican, the country’s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said Sunday.
Ebrard, who will travel to El Paso Monday, said Mexico was looking at legal action which could lead to extradition of the gunman.
""For Mexico, this individual is a terrorist,"" he said.
The manifesto posted shortly before the shooting also praises the killing of 51 Muslims at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March.
Police said the suspected shooter has been charged with murder offenses that can carry the death penalty, and a federal official said investigators are treating the El Paso shooting as a case of domestic terrorism.
At the Walmart in El Paso, terrified shoppers cowered in aisles or ran out of the store as gunfire echoed.
Most of the victims were inside the store but some were also in the parking lot outside, police said.
""Shooting kids and women and men, to him it mostly mattered that they were Hispanic,"" said Manuel Sanchez, a resident of the city.
These were the 250th and 251st mass shootings this year in the US, according to the Gun Violence Archive, an NGO that defines a mass shooting as an incident in which at least four people are wounded or killed.
Despite a string of horrific mass shootings in the US, where gun culture is deep-rooted, efforts to strengthen firearms regulations remain divisive.
The latest two shootings ended a particularly tragic week for gun violence in America: three people died in a shooting at a food festival last Sunday in California, and two more Tuesday in a shooting in a Walmart in Mississippi.
On Twitter, Trump described the El Paso attack as ""an act of cowardice.""
But critics said the president’s habit of speaking in derogatory terms about immigrants is pushing hatred of foreigners into the political mainstream and encouraging white supremacism.
""To pretend that his administration and the hateful rhetoric it spreads doesn’t play a role in the kind of violence that we saw yesterday in El Paso is ignorant at best and irresponsible at worst,"" said the Southern Poverty Law Center, a major civil rights group.
It cited Trump actions like calling Mexican migrants rapists and drug dealers and doing nothing when a crowd at a Trump rally chanted ""send her back"" in reference to a Somali-born congresswoman.
The Republican mayor of El Paso, Dee Margo, seemed to discount any race element to the Texas shooting, telling Fox News the gunman was ""deranged.""
But multiple Democratic presidential hopefuls said Trump bears some of the blame for the violence.
""Our president isn’t just failing to confront and disarm these domestic terrorists, he is amplifying and condoning their hate,"" Mayor Pete Buttigieg tweeted.
""Mr. President: stop your racist, hateful and anti-immigrant rhetoric. Your language creates a climate which emboldens violent extremists,"" Senator Bernie Sanders wrote on Twitter. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-05-19/news_big_images/503769_96827705.jpg,world,"

Fiery Cairo car crash claims 19 lives,"

Iran's Zarif says US can't build Gulf coalition as allies 'ashamed',"
TEHRAN (AFP) - The United States is unable to build a naval coalition to escort tankers in the Gulf because its allies are too ""ashamed"" to join it, Iran’s foreign minister said Monday.

"Indian govt ends occupied Kashmir's special status after abrogating Articles 35A, 370","
NEW DELHI (Dunya News) – Amid escalating tension in occupied Kashmir following deployment of tens of thousands of additional troops, the Indian government on Monday has ended special status of the valley while scrapping articles 35A and 370 of the Constitution.

In a malicious attempt to turn Muslim majority into minority in occupied Kashmir, the Indian president has signed a four-point amendment decree in this regard.



According to details, the announcement was made by Indian Home Minister Amit Shah during his address in Rajya Sabha, upper house of Indian parliament. Shah said, “Kashmir will no longer be a state. It will be divided into two union territories – Kashmir, which will have a legislature, and Ladakh, which will be without a legislature.""
He also told that the valley would be re-organized geographically.”

The revocation of the articles has allowed other non-Muslim Indian citizens to buy land in the valley while a separate legislative assembly will be established there for its own laws.

Indian opposition protests against Shah’s announcement

Meanwhile, a rumpus erupted in upper house of Indian parliament after opposition chanted slogans and protested against Shah’s suggestion to discuss the legislation seeking to end special status for Kashmir.

Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said that the BJP had ""murdered the constitution today"".

Lockdown in occupied Kashmir as thousands more troops sent

On the other hand, authorities in occupied Kashmir placed large parts of the region under lockdown early Monday while India sent in tens of thousands of additional troops and traded accusations of clashes with Pakistan at their de facto border.
Communications were cut, with private mobile networks, internet services and telephone landlines cut, an AFP reporter said.
The state government ordered for Srinagar, ""As per the order, there shall be no movement of public and all educational institutions shall also remain closed. There will be a complete bar on holding any kind of public meetings or rallies during the period of operation of this order.""
Universities, schools and colleges in Kashmir were ordered to be shut, and one district in that region was placed under lockdown.

What are Articles 370, 35A

Article 370 gives special autonomous status to the Kashmir which means that no one from other state will be allowed to buy land or become permanent citizen of the valley. 

Whereas Article 35A, of the Indian Constitution 1954, provides special rights and privileges to the citizens of occupied Kashmir.
The laws had also reserved state government jobs for natives, as well as college places, in an effort to keep the state from being overrun by people from the rest of India.

Hong Kong leader says city on brink as protesters unleash travel chaos,"
HONG KONG (AFP) - Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters are close to creating a ""very dangerous situation"", the city’s leader warned Monday as train travel and international flights in the global financial hub were thrown into chaos.
The peak-hour efforts to lock down Hong Kong’s transport sector on Monday morning followed two months of unprecedented and often violent unrest, fuelled by demands for greater democracy in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.
With commuters unable to get to work and international travellers facing delays, chief executive Carrie Lam held a press conference to warn protesters and signal authorities would not buckle under the growing pressure.
""(They) have seriously undermined Hong Kong’s law and order and are pushing our city, the city that we all love and many of us helped to build, to the verge of a very dangerous situation,"" Lam said.
She later referenced called by protesters for a ""revolution"", describing this as a challenge to the ‘one country, two systems’ framework under which Hong Kong has been ruled since it returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
""I dare say they are trying to destroy Hong Kong,"" Lam said.
She spoke shortly after activists descended on key subway stations during the morning rush hour, deliberately keeping open doors to stop trains departing, crippling multiple lines and triggering occasional scuffles.

Flights cancelled, shops closed 


More than 100 flights at the city’s airport -- one of the world’s busiest -- were also listed as cancelled on Monday morning.
Many disrupted flights were with Cathay Pacific.
The carrier did not give a reason for the cancellations, but its flight attendants union confirmed some of its members had walked out.
""Over the last 50 days, the government has been ignoring the demands of the people and using only police force to try to suppress voices, causing countless Hong Kong people to despair,"" the union said in a statement on its Facebook page.
Some key roads were also blockaded, causing traffic gridlock, as the protesters urged a general strike across the city.
The largely leaderless protest movement uses social messaging apps to coordinate.
But people from all walks of life indicated plans online to either strike or phone in sick on Monday -- from civil servants and social workers, to bus drivers and even employees of the city’s Disneyland.
Many shops across the city were shuttered, including fashion outlets in the central commercial district like Topshop and Zara.
Alongside the strike, protesters planned to hold rallies in seven different parts of the city on Monday.
While some commuters were angered by the disruptions, others said they supported the action.
""As long as the government doesn’t respond then for sure the movement will escalate,"" a civil servant, who gave his surname as Leung, told AFP as he tried to make his way to work.

China warnings 


The efforts for a general strike -- a rare sight in a freewheeling finance hub where unions traditionally have little sway -- is aimed at showing Beijing there is still broad public support for a protest movement that keeps hitting the streets but has so far won few concessions.
""Support for the political strike today seems strong and it’s been bolstered further by the escalating violence between the police and protesters,"" political analyst Dixon Wong told AFP.
The protests were triggered by opposition against a planned law that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China.
It quickly evolved into a wider movement for democratic reform and a halt to eroding freedoms.
Even before Lam’s press conference, authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing had signalled a hardening stance to the protests.
The Chinese military described the unrest last week as ""intolerable"" and released a propaganda video showing a drill of troops quelling a protest in Hong Kong.
Dozens of protesters were also charged with rioting over the past fortnight, a charge with a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail.
Over the weekend riot police fired tear gas at protesters in multiple districts throughout Saturday and Sunday night.
The past fortnight has seen a surge in violence on both sides with police repeatedly firing rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse increasingly hostile projectile-throwing crowds.
A group of men suspected to be linked to triads -- Hong Kong’s notorious gangsters -- also attacked demonstrators, putting 45 people in hospital.
Under the terms of the 1997 handover deal with Britain, Hong Kong has rights and liberties unseen on the Chinese mainland, including an independent judiciary and freedom of speech. But many say those rights are being curtailed. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-05-19/news_big_images/503729_64302522.jpg,world,"""Over the last 50 days, the government has been ignoring the demands of the people and using only police force to try to suppress voices, causing countless Hong Kong people to despair,"" the union said in a statement on its Facebook page.",neutral
Five things to know about the first round-world trip,"
LISBON (AFP) - Five centuries ago a fleet set sail from Spain on a voyage that would become the first trip right around the world.
It was an adventure fraught with danger, death, and disputes.
Here are the dramatic highs and lows of a feat that changed history:

Not everyone was on board 


Spain’s king, Emperor Charles V, backed the voyage after the lead adventurer, Ferdinand Magellan, could not convince the king of his native Portugal to support his ambitious project.
On August 10, 1519, Magellan set off with five ships and 237 men in a quest to discover a new route to Indonesia’s spice-rich Moluccas Islands. But his crew was pessimistic about the trip and he faced mutinies organised by his Spanish captains.
Just a year into the voyage, Magellan had already lost two of the vessels. One of them sank south of the American continent and the other fled back to Spain instead of risking the heavy storms in the southern seas.

Death of the leader 


The adventure wrote Magellan’s name into the history books, but the lead explorer did not even finish the journey.
He was killed in a fight with indigenous people on the island of Mactan in the Philippines in April 1521.
Spaniard Juan Sebastian Elcano took the helm and completed the voyage with 18 other survivors from Magellan’s crew. They returned to Seville in September 1522 aboard the only surviving ship, the Victoria.

Disputed triumph 


Magellan was a pioneer in the golden age of exploration that contributed to Portugal’s colonial expansion. But the Spanish have insisted the triumph was theirs.
Spain’s Royal Academy of History said in March the circumnavigation of the globe was an ""exclusively Spanish"" venture.
The two neighbours have agreed to jointly commemorate this year’s quincentenary.

Disobeying the king 


The original instructions from Charles V were for the fleet to reach the Moluccas Islands and return to Spain by sailing back east, not to try and make it full-circle around the world.
Two ships made it to the Moluccas Islands. One of them perished in a storm in an attempt to return to Spain by crossing the Pacific. The other, captained by Elcano, defied the king of Spain’s orders and succeeded in its gamble to sail west, avoiding Portuguese waters.

‘Conceptual revolution’ 


In spite of the setbacks and the dispute as to who should claim the glory, the story itself sailed into history.
""Magellan marked a conceptual revolution,"" said Jose Manuel Marques, who is leading the Portuguese commemorations to mark the 500th anniversary.
""He gave us for the first time a complete vision of the world, which showed us that there is only one ocean and that the sea is the link between peoples."" ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-05-19/news_big_images/503723_64029771.jpg,world,"

Lockdown in occupied Kashmir as thousands more troops sent,"
SRINAGAR (AFP) - Authorities in occupied Kashmir placed large parts of the disputed region under lockdown early Monday while India sent in tens of thousands of additional troops and traded accusations of clashes with Pakistan at their de facto border.
Communications were cut, with private mobile networks, internet services and telephone landlines cut, an AFP reporter said.
Before the network disruptions, senior former and current Kashmiri political leaders tweeted that they had been put under house arrest.
The Himalayan region has surged back into the spotlight in the past few days, months after a militant attack on an Indian paramilitary convoy claimed by a Pakistan-based group sparked cross-border airstrikes by the nuclear-armed rivals.
They have controlled parts of the region since the end of British colonial rule on the subcontinent in 1947.
But both claim it in full and have fought two of three wars over the territory, where a decades-long insurgency on the Indian side has killed tens of thousands.
""As per the order, there shall be no movement of public and all educational institutions shall also remain closed,"" the state government ordered for Srinagar, the capital of Indian-occupied Kashmir, and surrounding areas in a statement obtained by AFP.
""There will be a complete bar on holding any kind of public meetings or rallies during the period of operation of this order.""
Universities, schools and colleges in the Hindu-dominated Jammu were ordered to be shut, and one district in that region was placed under lockdown.
Several other major districts of the Muslim-majority state were also placed under restrictions, local media reported.
The latest tensions started in the last 10 days after New Delhi deployed at least 10,000 troops. A security source told AFP a further 70,000 had been deployed, which is believed to be an unprecedented level.
The government has introduced other security measures over terror threat claims -- including a call to stock up food and fuel.
The measures have sparked growing panic among residents, who formed long queues outside petrol stations, food stores and cash machines.
A heavy presence of troops was seen in parts of Srinagar as gunshots sounded, although the streets remained empty, local residents told AFP.
In downtown Srinagar, government forces threw ""chili bombs"" that affect respiratory systems onto the deserted streets, a local resident said, while a senior official told AFP that nearly 300 administrative officials and top security officials had been issued with satellite phones.
""I believe I m being placed under house arrest from midnight tonight & the process has already started for other mainstream leaders,"" Omar Abdullah, a former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, tweeted before communications were cut.
The last time similar restrictions were imposed in the territory was in 2016 after the killing of a popular rebel leader, which sparked months of street protests that left nearly 100 dead.
The restrictions came as India and Pakistan traded tit-for-tat accusations of attacks across the Line of Control, the de facto border dividing Kashmir.
The Indian army said Sunday it had foiled an attempt by a Pakistani team of army regulars and militants to cross the Line of Control, killing ""five to seven"" attackers.
Pakistan described the claim as ""baseless"" and accused India of using cluster bombs against civilians, killing four people and injuring 11 others.
Muhammad Siddique, the father of one victim, told reporters his son Ayan Ahmad was killed by an unexploded cluster munition while he and other youngsters played with it.
New Delhi has denied using the weapons.
Pakistan s Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday accused India of taking ""new aggressive actions"", saying it could ""blow up into a regional crisis"".
He called a meeting of the country s national security committee to review the situation in Kashmir.
Tourists and students have scrambled to leave the picturesque region since the government said they should depart ""immediately"", amid new intelligence about ""terror threats"" to a major Hindu pilgrimage in the region.
While the Indian military and the state government have highlighted the security risk, Kashmiri and opposition politicians in New Delhi are concerned the extra troops were deployed for other reasons.
Since mid-2018, Kashmir has been under Delhi s direct rule after Prime Minister Narendra Modi s Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew support for its local partner and dissolved the local government.
There are fears Modi s Hindu nationalist government could carry out a threat to scrap the region s special status under the constitution.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-05-19/news_big_images/503714_52592108.jpg,world,"Tourists and students have scrambled to leave the picturesque region since the government said they should depart ""immediately"", amid new intelligence about ""terror threats"" to a major Hindu pilgrimage in the region.",positive
"U.S. designates China a currency manipulator, escalating trade war","
WASHINGTON/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A yearlong U.S.-China trade war boiled over on Monday as Washington accused Beijing of manipulating its currency after China let the yuan drop to its lowest point in more than a decade.
The U.S. Treasury Department announced late on Monday that it had determined for the first time since 1994 that China was manipulating its currency, knocking the U.S. dollar .DXY sharply lower and sending gold prices XAU= to a six-year high.
The designation by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin starts a formal process of bilateral negotiations between the world’s two largest economies, and fulfills a promise made by U.S. President Donald Trump on his first day in office.
“As a result of this determination, Secretary Mnuchin will engage with the International Monetary Fund to eliminate the unfair competitive advantage created by China’s latest actions,” the Treasury Department said.
The IMF had no immediate comment. Last month, the global lender said China’s yuan was broadly in line with economic fundamentals, while the U.S. dollar was overvalued by 6% to 12%.
The Treasury statement, made after the stock trading session ended, sent S&P 500 futures EScv1 down more than 1%, suggesting investors expect Wall Street to open on Tuesday with additional losses following Monday’s drop of 3% on the S&P 500.
The U.S. action came after China let its currency weaken 1.4%, sending it past the key 7-per-dollar level for the first time in more than a decade. Beijing also halted U.S. agricultural purchases, inflaming a trade war that has roiled financial markets, disrupted supply chains and slowed global growth.
Even before the formal designation, Trump on Monday accused Beijing on Twitter of manipulating its currency.
“China dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. It’s called ‘currency manipulation.’ Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!” Trump tweeted.
Trump had stunned financial markets last week by vowing to impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1.
In its statement, the Treasury Department said the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) on Monday made clear that Chinese authorities had ample control over the yuan exchange rate despite their rejection of any claims of manipulation.
“This is an open acknowledgement by the PBOC that it has extensive experience manipulating its currency and remains prepared to do so on an ongoing basis,” the Treasury statement said.
It said China’s actions violate its commitment to refrain from competitive devaluation as part of the Group of 20 industrialized countries. Treasury said it expected China to adhere to those commitments and not target China’s exchange rate for competitive purposes.
U.S. law sets out three criteria for identifying manipulation among major trading partners: a material global current account surplus, a significant bilateral trade surplus with the United States, and persistent one-way intervention in foreign exchange markets.
After determining a country is a manipulator, the Treasury is required to demand special talks aimed at correcting an undervalued currency, with penalties such as exclusion from U.S. government procurement contracts.
The U.S. Treasury had designated Taiwan and South Korea as currency manipulators in 1988, the year that Congress enacted the currency review law. China was the last country to get the designation, in 1994.
Mark Sobel, a former senior Treasury and IMF official, said Mnuchin was probably ordered by Trump to issue the designation.
“It’s ridiculous that they’ve declared China a currency manipulator. They don’t have any meaningful tools to do anything about it, unless they just want to pile more tariffs on,” said Sobol, who now works with the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a London-based think tank.

PBOC DENIES COMPETITIVE DEVALUATION

Before the U.S. designation, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) provided an early impetus for yuan bears by setting a daily rate for the currency at its weakest level in eight months, weakening a long defense that kept the yuan stronger than 7 to the dollar.
The move was made with the blessing of policymakers to factor in market concerns around the U.S.-China trade war and its effect on China’s weakening economic growth, three people with knowledge of Chinese monetary deliberations told Reuters.
Hours before the U.S. action, PBOC Governor Yi Gang, who has been a key player in U.S.-China trade negotiations, said the yuan was now at an appropriate level given China’s economic fundamentals. He said that China would not engage in a competitive devaluation and would maintain the stability and continuity of foreign exchange management policies.
The PBOC had linked the yuan’s weakness to the fallout from the trade war, but said it would not change its currency policy and that two-way fluctuations in the yuan’s value were normal.
With the escalating trade war giving Beijing fewer reasons to maintain yuan stability, some analysts said they expect the currency to continue to weaken further to as low as 7.3 to the dollar.
The flare-up in trade tensions has renewed global financial market concerns over how much China will allow the yuan to weaken to offset heavier pressure on its exporters.
Despite slowing economic growth over the past year amid the intensifying trade war, China has not seen a rush of capital flight, thanks to capital controls put in place during the last economic downturn and growing foreign inflows into Chinese stocks and bonds.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-06-19/news_big_images/503885_28907651.jpg,business,"The PBOC had linked the yuan’s weakness to the fallout from the trade war, but said it would not change its currency policy and that two-way fluctuations in the yuan’s value were normal.",positive
"Asia stocks hit six-month low as investors flee to safety, yuan slumps","
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares suffered their steepest daily drop in nine months on Monday, as Sino-U.S. trade friction sent the yuan slumping to a more than decade trough and stampeded investors into safe harbours including the yen, bonds and gold.
Markets have been badly spooked since U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly declared he would slap 10% tariffs on $300 billion (£246.9 billion) in Chinese imports, ending a month-long trade truce. China vowed on Friday to fight back.
In response, China s yuan CNH= CNY= burst beyond the psychological 7-per-dollar threshold in a move that threatened to unleash a whole new front in the trade hostilities - a currency war.
“Everything is selling off right now,” said Ray Attrill, head of forex strategy at National Australia Bank in Sydney. “We have no reason to expect any cessation in selling unless we see any strong action to defend any CNY or CNH weakness.”
“Our working assumption is that we are unlikely to see any meaningful resolution to the trade dispute anytime soon.”
Asian share markets were a sea of red with Japan s Nikkei .N225 shedding 2.3% to the lowest since early June. It was the sharpest daily drop since March and led Japanese officials to call a special meeting to discuss market turmoil.
Australian shares slipped about 1.5% to spend their fourth straight session in the red, and South Korea s KOSPI .KS11 tumbled 2.1% to hit its lowest since December 2016.
MSCI s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS sank 2.2% to depths not seen since late January.In China, the blue-chip index .CSI300 fell 1% while the troubled Hong Kong market .HSI hit a seven-month trough.
The pain was quick to spread, with futures for the S&P500 ESc1, the FTSE FFIc1 and EUROSTOXX STXEc1 all down more than 1%.
Oil prices were dragged down on demand worries, while gold climbed 0.8% to $1,452.17 an ounce XAU=.
The grim mood followed declines on Wall Street on Friday with MSCI’s gauge of world stocks .MIWD00000PUS posting its largest weekly loss of the year.
The trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies has already disrupted global supply chains and investment.
The abrupt escalation capped a critical week for global markets after the U.S. Federal Reserve delivered a widely anticipated interest rate cut and played down expectations of further easing.
EVER DEEPER CUTS
So far, investors are not buying Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s claim that the 25-basis-point rate reduction was a mere “mid-cycle adjustment to policy”.
Futures are now pricing in deeper cuts than before last week’s Fed meeting. The terminal U.S. rate <0#FF:> is seen at 1.22%, 93 basis points below the current effective rate.
Analysts at TD Securities are forecasting no less than five more cuts from the Fed, amounting to 125 basis points of easing, over the coming year or so.
Bond markets were well ahead of the game as U.S. 10-year yields US10YT=RR dived 7 basis points to 1.77%, a violent shift for usually cautious Asian hours. Yields in Australia and New Zealand touched all-time lows.
German 10-year government bond yields DE10YT=RR dropped on Friday to an all-time low of -0.502% and the country’s entire government bond yield curve turned negative for the first time ever.
The flight to safety lifted the yen, which often gains at times of stress thanks to Japan s position as the world s largest creditor. The dollar slipped to a seven-month trough of 105.78 yen JPY=, while the euro sank to its lowest since April 2017 at 117.64 yen EURJPY=.
That dragged the dollar index .DXY off 0.1%, though it was up against most other Asian currencies and those exposed to China or commodities including the Australian dollar.
The Aussie AUD=D3, a liquid proxy for emerging market and China risk, slipped to a fresh seven-month trough at $0.6748 after losing 1.6% last week.
The Swiss franc CHF= was boosted by safe-haven demand from the escalating trade tensions. Trump is also eyeing tariffs on the European Union, but is yet to make any formal announcements. The euro EUR= was relatively steady on the dollar at $1.1125.
Sterling GBP= hovered near 2017 lows at $1.2150, pressured by concerns about Britain exiting the European Union without a deal in place.

HSBC CEO Flint leaves abruptly after only 18 months in role,"
HONG KONG (Reuters) – HSBC (HSBA.L) announced the shock departure of Chief Executive Officer John Flint after just 18 months in the role, saying the bank needed a change at the top to address “a challenging global environment”.
Flint’s exit, which a person familiar with the matter said was a result of differences over execution of his strategy, was disclosed early on Monday along with HSBC’s half-yearly results which had been scheduled for release later in the day.
The departure comes as Europe’s biggest bank is grappling with headwinds including an escalation of a trade war between China and the United States, an easing monetary policy cycle, unrest in the key Hong Kong market and uncertainty about Brexit.
HSBC s Hong Kong shares (0005.HK) were down 1.5% by the market s lunchtime break, while the broader market .HSI was down 2.9%.
The stock dropped even as the lender posted a 16% rise in half-yearly profit and unveiled a buyback of up to $1 billion, defying some analysts’ expectations it might pause a strategy of returning extra capital to investors.
Flint, 51, ran HSBC’s retail and wealth management business before taking over as CEO in February 2018. His appointment was the first major decision taken by the bank’s first externally appointed chairman Mark Tucker, who came on board in late 2017.
“In the increasingly complex and challenging global environment ... the board believes a change is needed to meet the challenges that we face and to capture the very significant opportunities before us,” Tucker said in a statement.
London-headquartered HSBC, which makes more than 80% of its profit in Asia, said the board would consider internal and external candidates for the new CEO. Noel Quinn, the head of its global commercial banking unit, will be interim chief executive.
While the bank did not elaborate upon the reason for Flint’s sudden departure, a person familiar with the matter said it was a result of differences of opinion between Flint and Tucker over the pace and result of the strategy execution.
The main difference arose from Flint’s softer approach to cutting expenses and setting revenue targets for senior managers to boost profit growth, said the person, declining to be named due to sensitivity of the issue.
An HSBC spokesman in Hong Kong declined to comment.
Daniel Tabbush, an independent banking analyst who publishes his research on SmartKarma, said: “I can only speculate that he (Flint) was underachieving on numbers. What may also be the case, but there is no way to know for sure, is that he may have been trying to push through real change and this was being frowned upon. On the surface, it does not look good and especially for so short a tenure as CEO.”
When he was picked as CEO, Flint was viewed by HSBC executives as a safe option as he had been with the bank since 1989 and worked across most of its businesses. He spent the first 14 years of his HSBC career in Asia.
Outlining his strategy at the helm of the bank in June last year, Flint set out plans to invest $15-$17 billion in the next three years in areas including technology and China.
REVENUE RISK
HSBC’s pre-tax profit for the first six months of 2019 rose to $12.41 billion from $10.71 billion in the same period a year earlier, helped by a surge in retail banking and Asia revenues.
The bank flagged the risk to its business from the U.S.-China trade war and the change in the interest rate cycle.
The tit-for-tat tariff war between the world’s two largest economies has taken its toll on trade-focused banks like HSBC and rival Standard Chartered (STAN.L), which last week warned of an impact on its business customers from the escalating tensions.
“The outlook has changed. Interest rates in the US dollar bloc are now expected to fall rather than rise, and geopolitical issues could impact a significant number of our major markets,” HSBC said in its earnings statement.
The bank was “managing operating expenses and investment spending in line with the increased risks to revenue,” it said.
Prior to the latest buyback announcement, HSBC had purchased more than $6 billion of its own shares since 2016.
Analysts had been watching closely to see whether the bank would announce a fresh buyback, as a failure to do so would have been read as a sign of mounting caution by HSBC’s management.  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-05-19/news_big_images/503743_30210308.jpg,business,"

A weekly review: Rupee recovers Rs1.47 against dollar; PSX drops 1.4pc,"
KARACHI (Dunya News) – In the recent unprecedented statistics, the Pakistani rupee has appreciated by Rs1.47 against the US dollar in the outgoing week and closed at Rs159.11 in the interbank market on Friday.
In the open market, the local currency gained by Rs1.20 against the greenback with slight fluctuation in the whole week and settled at Rs159.50 on Friday.
Currency traders are of the view that the increasing inflows of remittance in connection with Eidul Fitr have supported the local rupee in the market. According to them, the majority of inflows came from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, including the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
In the previous week, the Pakistani rupee has depreciated by 39 paisa against the US dollar in the outgoing week and closed at Rs160.58 on July 26.
In the earlier weeks, the rupee was observed to cumulatively depreciate against the greenback, which in turn had resulted in increased prices of goods and hardships for the general public.
The SBP has let the rupee depreciate significantly in the inter-bank market after finalising an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a loan programme on May 12.
The IMF has asked Pakistan to end state control of the rupee and let the currency move freely to find its equilibrium against the US dollar.
On the other hand, the World Bank Group has also supported the idea of leaving the rupee free from state control in an attempt to give much-needed boost to exports and fix a faltering economy.
In the previous weeks, the local currency has depreciated massively despite receiving the first tranche of $991.4 million from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The stringent conditions – on which the global moneylender has formally approved the bailout package of $6 billion for Pakistan – seem to have exerted more pressure on the local currency.
The gradual drop in the rupee had come due to high demand for the dollar against thin supply as the country continued to make aggressive international payments to partially pay off huge foreign debt and for imports.
Economists are of the view that effective measures must be implemented on the priority basis to recover the state from the balance of payment deficit.
Besides increased demand of the greenback in the local market, they have termed ‘balance of payments deficit’ as the main reason in the recent hike in the value of the US dollar.
Moreover, they consider that state’s exports and investment are required to grow significantly, and the imports must be reduced to remove pressure on the local currency.
According to experts, the government must ensure implementations on economic policies after the deal with the IMF.
It is anticipated that the US dollar rate would fluctuate for some time, and the value of the Pakistani rupee would stabilise after proper implementation of the economic policies.

ADB introduces contingent disaster financing for natural disasters,"
ISLAMABAD (Web Desk) – The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has introduced a new financing mechanism contingent disaster financing (CDF) to support its developing member countries in strengthening disaster preparedness and provide quick-disbursing budget support following natural disasters.
""CDF will provide a quick and flexible source of funds for developing member countries affected by disasters until funds from other sources become available,"" a statement from ADB Director General of ADB s Strategy, Policy, and Partnerships Department Tomoyuki Kimura said. 
""It will also help promote greater preparedness and risk management in developing member countries prone to disasters."" Asia and the Pacific is the world s most natural disaster-prone region. Between 2014 and 2017, countries in the region suffered 55 earthquakes, 217 storms and cyclones, and 236 cases of severe flooding, affecting 650 million people and causing about 33,000 deaths, according to the United Nations.
CDF approved today by ADB s Board of Directors will cover disasters triggered by natural hazards such as typhoons, floods, earthquakes, droughts, and tsunamis. 
A key feature of CDF is that it supports essential policy reforms to strengthen disaster preparedness that are to be completed before a natural disaster occurs. Once a CDF is approved for a country, it remains active until a disaster occurs. 
The country can then quickly access the approved financing to help relieve fiscal constraints for urgent relief and recovery efforts and avoid disruptive reallocations from priority budget programs.
""Where necessary, CDF disbursements can be accompanied by follow-up assistance through ADB s other emergency or regular lending instruments to support recovery and reconstruction,"" said Mr. Kimura.
The new financing supports Strategy 2030 s operational priority of tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability.
ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. In 2018, it made commitments of new loans and grants amounting to $21.6 billion. Established in 1966, it is owned by 68 members 49 from the region, the statement added.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-02-19/news_big_images/503432_50768583.jpg,business,"

"Trump hits China with more tariffs, sharply escalating trade dispute","
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1, sharply escalating a bruising trade war between the world’s largest economies and jolting financial markets.
The announcement on Thursday extends Trump’s trade tariffs to nearly all of the Chinese goods the United States imports and marks an abrupt end to a temporary truce in a trade row that has hurt world growth and disrupted global supply chains.
Trump also threatened to raise tariffs further if China’s President Xi Jinping fails to move more quickly to strike a trade deal.
“I think President Xi ... wants to make a deal, but frankly, he’s not going fast enough,” Trump said.
Trump made the announcement in a series of Twitter posts after his top trade negotiators briefed him on a lack of progress in U.S.-China talks in Shanghai this week.
Trump later said if trade negotiations fail to progress he could raise tariffs further - even beyond the 25 percent levy he has already imposed on $250 billion of imports from China.
Senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi told reporters on the sidelines of an Association of Southeast Nations event in Thailand the additional tariffs were “not a correct way” to deal with the bilateral dispute.
“Additional tariffs is definitely not a constructive way to resolve economic and trade frictions,” he said.
The news hit U.S. financial markets hard. On Friday, Asian stocks took a battering and the safe-haven yen jumped as investors rushed for cover.
Oil prices plummeted 7%, with Brent crude registering the biggest daily percentage drop since February 2016. The benchmark S&P 500, which had been in solidly positive territory on Thursday afternoon, closed down 0.9%. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields also fell.
Retail associations predicted a spike in consumer prices. Target Corp tumbled 4.2%, Macy’s Inc fell 6% and Nordstrom Inc was down 6.2%.
Asked about the impact on financial markets, Trump told reporters: “I’m not concerned about that at all.”
Moody’s said the new tariffs would weigh on the global economy at a time when growth is already slowing in the United States, China and the euro zone.
The tariffs may also force the Federal Reserve to again cut interest rates to protect the U.S. economy from trade-policy risks, experts said.
Raising tariffs would lower the prospects of a deal rather than expedite it, China’s Global Times newspaper said. Beijing would focus more on efforts to survive a prolonged trade war, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Communist Party-backed newspaper, said on Twitter.
“New tariffs will by no means bring closer a deal that the U.S. wants; it will only make it further away,” Hu said.
CHINESE RETALIATION?
Possible retaliatory measures by China could include tariffs, a ban on the export of rare earths and penalties against U.S. companies in China.
So far, Beijing has refrained from slapping tariffs on U.S. crude oil and big aircraft, after cumulatively imposing additional retaliatory tariffs of up to 25% on about $110 billion of U.S. goods since the trade war broke out last year.
China is also drafting a list of “unreliable entities” - foreign firms that have harmed Chinese interests. U.S. delivery giant FedEx is under investigation by China.
“China will deliver each retaliation methodically, and deliberately, one by one,” ING economist Iris Pang wrote in a note.
“We believe China’s strategy in this trade war escalation will be to slow down the pace of negotiation and tit-for-tat retaliation. This could lengthen the process of retaliation until the upcoming U.S. presidential election,” Pang said.
FRUSTRATED
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin briefed Trump on their first face-to-face meeting with Chinese officials since Trump met Xi at the G20 summit at the end of June and agreed to a ceasefire in the trade war.
“When my people came home, they said, ‘We’re talking. We have another meeting in early September.’ I said, ‘That’s fine, but until such time as there’s a deal, we’ll be taxing them,” Trump told reporters.
A source familiar with the matter said Trump grew frustrated and composed the tweets shortly after Lighthizer and Mnuchin told him China made no significant movement on its position.
Previous negotiations collapsed in May, when U.S. officials accused China of backing away from earlier commitments.
American business groups in China expressed disquiet over the latest round of U.S. tariffs. The U.S.-China Business Council said on Friday it was concerned the action “will drive the Chinese from the negotiating table, reducing hope raised by a second round of talks that ended this week in Shanghai.”
“We are particularly concerned about increased regulatory scrutiny, delays in licenses and approvals, and discrimination against U.S. companies in government procurement tenders,” said the U.S.-China Business Council’s President Craig Allen in an e-mail.
Ker Gibbs, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, urged both sides to keep talking.
Gibbs said that as market access in China “remains unnecessarily restricted,” the United States should continue its dialogue with Beijing, and “also work with like-minded countries to persuade China that fair and reciprocal trade and investment benefits all.”
CROPS AND DRUGS
Trump said Beijing had failed to stop sales of the synthetic opioid fentanyl to the United States, as it had promised to do. He also said Beijing had not fulfilled a goodwill pledge to buy more U.S. agricultural products.
Trump has failed to make good on a goodwill gesture he said he would make after the G20 meeting to relax restrictions on sales to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei.
Trump had been pressing Xi to crack down on a flood of fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances from China, which U.S. officials say is the main source of a drug blamed for most of more than 28,000 synthetic opioid-related overdose deaths in the United States in 2017.
China had pledged that from May 1 it would expand the list of narcotics subject to state control to include the more than 1,400 known fentanyl analogues, which have a slightly different chemical makeup but are addictive and potentially deadly, as well as any new ones developed in the future.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday confirmed a small private sale to China of 68,000 tonnes of soybeans in the week ended July 25.
It was the first sale to a private buyer since Beijing offered to exempt five crushers from the 25% import tariffs imposed more than a year ago. Soybean futures opened lower on Thursday as traders shrugged off the purchase because of the small volume involved, and losses accelerated after Trump’s tweets.
RETAIL IMPACT
The new tariffs will jack up prices for consumers at the start of the back-to-school buying season, four large retail trade associations said on Thursday.
“President Trump is, in effect, using American families as a hostage in his trade war negotiations,” said Matt Priest, president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America.
Stephen Lamar, executive vice president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, said his group’s members were shocked that Trump had not allowed the resumed U.S.-China trade talks to proceed further before acting.
The measure will hit U.S. consumers far harder than Chinese manufacturers, who produce 42% of apparel and 69% of footwear purchased in the United States, Lamar said.  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-02-19/news_big_images/503355_62067159.jpg,business,"The U.S.-China Business Council said on Friday it was concerned the action “will drive the Chinese from the negotiating table, reducing hope raised by a second round of talks that ended this week in Shanghai.”

Pakistan July consumer inflation accelerates to 10.3pc,"
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan’s consumer inflation rate accelerated to 10.3% year-on-year in July, from 8.9% a month earlier, driven by higher food and fuel prices, the Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday, underlining the growing squeeze on household budgets.
Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government, which last month agreed a $6 billion bailout with the International Monetary Fund, has faced growing public anger at the relentless increase in prices since it came to power a year ago.
Prices of food staples like wheat, meat, pulses, onions, sugar, beans and potatoes, saw double-digit increases, with overall food and non-alcoholic beverage prices rising 7.9%.
In addition, there were sharp rises in energy and fuel prices, with gas prices up 143% from the previous year and petrol prices up 23%.
The squeeze in prices has come on the back of a sliding rupee currency which has lost almost a third of its value against the dollar over the past year, helping to drive up energy prices, despite government controls.
On Thursday, Khan ordered a rollback in increases to gas prices paid by operators of ovens used to make roti, a form of flat bread that is one of the staples of the Pakistani diet.

Three things we learned from the first Ashes Test,"
BIRMINGHAM (AFP) – Australia overwhelmed England by 251 runs to win the first Test at Edgbaston on Monday.
Below AFP Sport looks at three things we learned from the opening match in a five-Test clash for the Ashes.
Smith as good as he ever was
Any thoughts Steve Smith might be rusty on his return to Test cricket following a 12-month ban for his involvement in a ball-tampering scandal were dashed by innings of 144 and 142.
His opening century of this Ashes series revived Australia from the depths of 122-8, while his second helped put them in a position to declare. By scoring hundreds in both innings of an Ashes Test, Smith achieved a feat even beyond Australia’s Don Bradman, widely regarded as cricket’s greatest batsman.
Smith’s Test average of 62.96 is now second only to Bradman’s staggering 99.94 among batsmen to have played 20 innings at this level.
England captain Douglas Jardine resorted to infamous ‘Bodyline’ tactics in a bid to curb Bradman’s run-scoring during the 1932/33 Ashes.
That option is no longer available to current England captain Joe Root, who now faces the difficult task of planning a way to dismiss Smith while making sure his attack don’t get a complex about bowling to the unorthodox batsman.
Smith top-scored with 687 runs at 137.4 during Australia’s 4-0 home Ashes win in 2017/18 and the way he started at Edgbaston, impervious to the booing from home fans, was an ominous sign for England.
Spin to win
A dry and increasingly slow pitch was a surface on which spinners would expect to bowl well. But while Australia’s Nathan Lyon took nine wickets in the match, including 6-49 in England’s second-innings collapse to 146 all out, opposing off-spinner Moeen Ali offered nothing like the same threat or even control.
England will point to the fact that paceman James Anderson broke down with a calf injury just four overs into the game as an unlucky break -- although the fact their all-time leading Test wicket-taker already had a calf problem suggests their decision to field the 37-year-old was a calculated risk that did not come off.
It may be that England decide to bring in left-arm spinner Jack Leach for the second Test at Lord’s, especially as Moeen’s batting has now disintegrated to the extent he has four ducks in his last nine Test innings.
Meanwhile World Cup-winning England fast bowler Jofra Archer will have to prove he has overcome a side injury before he can make a Test debut.
Batting contrasts
Before this series many pundits thought that, given the strength of both attacks, batting rather than bowling would be the decisive factor in deciding the destiny of this Ashes.
Australia may have suffered a first-innings collapse but the way middle-order batsman Travis Head made 35 before following up with 51 in a second innings where Matthew Wade struck a century was an encouraging sign for the tourists.
England have long had problems with their top-order but this match did see opener Rory Burns make a maiden Test century although some observers still harbour doubts about the left-hander’s unorthodox technique.
Of greater concern to England is that middle-order batsmen Joe Denly, Jos Buttler and Jonny Bairstow failed to fire at Edgbaston, with the latter two twice out for single figures.
While there are arguments for retaining them individually, it is hard to see how they all feature at Lord’s.
Wicketkeeper Bairstow’s run of poor batting form -- he has passed 30 just twice in his last 17 Test innings -- could see him replaced by Ben Foakes, a better gloveman, who while not as good a batsman as the Yorkshireman does average over 40 at this level. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-06-19/news_big_images/503898_74769844.jpg,Cricket,"It may be that England decide to bring in left-arm spinner Jack Leach for the second Test at Lord’s, especially as Moeen’s batting has now disintegrated to the extent he has four ducks in his last nine Test innings.",neutral
Lyon bowls Australia to crushing win against England in Ashes opener,"
BIRMINGHAM (AFP) - Nathan Lyon took six wickets as Australia demolished England by 251 runs at their Edgbaston  fortress  to win the first Ashes Test on Monday.
The crushing defeat means England s hopes of a World Cup and Ashes double have suffered a major blow a month after the eventual champions beat Australia at the same ground in the semi-finals of the 50-over tournament.
To make matters worse, England could be without James Anderson, their all-time leading wicket-taker, for the second game of the five-match series at Lord s.
The paceman managed just four overs in the match before breaking down, depriving captain Joe Root of his main weapon.
Root must also work out how to cope with the threat of man-of-the-match Steve Smith, who scored twin hundreds at Edgbaston and now has 1,116 runs in his past 10 Ashes innings.
The home side, set a daunting 398 for victory, needed to bat out the final day to save the Test but a clatter of wickets either side of lunch left them staring at a heavy defeat.
They were eventually dismissed for 146, with off-spinner Lyon taking 6-49 and fast bowler Pat Cummins 4-32 in the first match of the new ICC World Test Championship.
Victory gave Australia their first win at Edgbaston in any format since 2001 -- the last time they won an Ashes series in England -- and ended the home side s run of 11 successive wins at Warwickshire s headquarters.
Australia were in dire straits at 122-8 in their first innings but were rescued by Smith s 144, which lifted them to 284.
The star batsman then made 142 in the second innings of his comeback Test following a ban for his role in a ball-tampering scandal, with Australia captain Tim Paine declaring on 487-7 late on Sunday.
""I thought we were certainly up against it at that stage (122-8) but we had the best player in the world at the crease,"" Paine said.
""We re running out of things to say about Smithy. He s probably the best Test batsman we ve ever seen.""
Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all returning to Test cricket following ball-tampering bans and the trio were repeatedly jeered by spectators at Edgbaston.
""We know every Test we play in England, the crowd will be against us. I thought the guys handled themselves really well and we ve come out on top,"" said Paine.
No England batsman made more than No.9 Chris Woakes s 37 in their second innings and captain Joe Root admitted: ""It is bitterly disappointing.""
""Credit to Australia,"" he added. ""They fought hard to get back in it. (Smith played) two brilliant innings.""

England collapse

Rory Burns, whose first-innings 133 was his first century at this level, became just the 10th cricketer to have batted on all five days of a Test.
But he had added just four runs to his overnight seven when he was caught in the gully off an excellent seaming and rising Cummins delivery.
Root was twice given out leg before by Joel Wilson but challenged both verdicts as the West Indian umpire equalled an unwanted record with eight overturned decisions in a Test.
World Cup-winner Jason Roy appeared to still be in one-day mode when he charged down the pitch and was bowled by Lyon for 28.
Lyon, whose return was his best against England, was dangerous on the wearing pitch and he had Joe Denly caught off bat and pad by Bancroft at short leg.
The Australia pair combined again to dismiss Root for 28.
England s 85-4 at lunch became 85-5 when Cummins bowled Jos Buttler and wickets continued to tumble as the home side slumped to 97-7.
All-rounder Woakes defied Australia for a time but Smith had the last word, catching him off Cummins to seal the win for the tourists.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-05-19/news_big_images/503843_51584683.jpg,Cricket,"To make matters worse, England could be without James Anderson, their all-time leading wicket-taker, for the second game of the five-match series at Lord s.

South African pacer Dale Steyn retires from Test cricket,"
JOHANNESBURG (AFP) - South African Dale Steyn, one of the great fast bowlers of the modern era, on Monday announced his retirement from Test cricket in a bid to extend his longevity in the shorter forms of the game.
Steyn, who made his international debut against England in 2004 and last played a Test in February against Sri Lanka, is still contracted in the white-ball form of the game for the 2019/20 season and therefore remains available for South Africa in one-day internationals and T20s.
Steyn took 439 wickets in 93 Tests at an average of 22.95. He held the top spot in the International Cricket Council’s Test bowler rankings for a record 263 weeks between 2008 and 2014.
""Today I walk away from a format of the game I love so much,"" said the 36-year-old Steyn, his country’s leading Test wicket-taker of all time and one of the top 10 in the history of the game.
""In my opinion Test cricket is the best version of this game. It tests you mentally, physically, emotionally. It’s terrible to consider never playing another Test again but what’s more terrifying is the thought of never playing again at all.
""So I will be focusing on ODIs and T20s for the rest of my career to maximise my full potential and ensure my longevity in this sport... I look forward to continuing to play for the Proteas in the shorter formats.""
Steyn was one of South Africa’s greatest match-winners. South Africa won 48 of the Tests in which he played and he was a member of South African teams that won consecutive series in England and Australia in both 2008 and 2012, becoming the number one ranked team in the world in 2012.
One of his greatest performances was in the second Test against Australia in Melbourne in 2008. He made his Test best score of 76 to help South Africa recover from a shaky position and had match figures of 10 for 154 as South Africa clinched a series win in Australia for the first time.

Remarkable strike rate

Lithe, with a whippy action that enabled him to bowl at close to 150kmh, he possessed a lethal outswinger capable of dismissing the world’s best batsmen. He also mastered reverse swing, which enabled him to be effective when the ball lost its shine.
He took five or more wickets on 26 occasions, achieving the feat against every other Test nation and in every continent, including five in Asia. His strike rate of a wicket every 42.3 balls was the best of any fast bowler with more than 200 wickets.
Steyn took his 400th Test wicket in 2015 but injuries blighted the latter part of his career. He suffered a hairline fracture of the right shoulder in a Test against England in December 2015, which kept him out of international cricket for eight months.
In his third Test back, against Australia in Perth in November 2016, a small piece of bone connected to the scapula in his shoulder broke off, sidelining him for more than a year.
Then, in his first Test back, against India in Cape Town in January 2018, he suffered a freak heel injury when he stepped in a foot hole, putting him out of the rest of the series.
He equalled Shaun Pollock’s record of 421 Test wickets in the first Test of a tour to Sri Lanka last year but went wicketless in the second and final Test.
He finally claimed the South African record when he dismissed Fakhar Zaman against Pakistan in Centurion in December.
He went on to play in all South Africa’s five home Tests during the 2018/19 season and was selected to play in the 2019 Cricket World Cup in England and Wales.
But he suffered a recurrence of his shoulder problem during a stint in the Indian Premier League in April. He was deemed fit enough to travel to England as part of South Africa’s World Cup squad but returned home without playing a game after what was described as a new shoulder injury.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-05-19/news_big_images/503831_50674562.jpg,Cricket,"Steyn, who made his international debut against England in 2004 and last played a Test in February against Sri Lanka, is still contracted in the white-ball form of the game for the 2019/20 season and therefore remains available for South Africa in one-day internationals and T20s.",neutral

""It feels pretty special, winning the first Test in England is really special. It feels great, I m loving being back playing cricket for Australia, doing what I love and contributing to wins,"" Smith told BBC s Test Match Special.
""To score two hundreds in a match -- the first time I ve done that in any form of cricket in my life -- is very special and I m very proud.""
Smith revealed he had lost his passion for cricket as a result of his ban and an elbow injury, but he is now fully motivated again and reaping the rewards.
""I didn t dream about how I would come back. I was just letting time pass and when I got my elbow brace off after surgery something clicked and I was ready to play cricket again. I did lose that love for a little bit but I m back doing what I love now and it s great,"" he said.
Smith changed the tone of the match, leading Australia to 284 all out in their first innings from a perilous 122-8.
""When I got that first hundred I was just thinking,  don t burst into tears.  That was as special as my first hundred back in 2013. It was a relief to get it out of the way,"" he said.
""I copped a bit of stick out there but I m not paying much attention to that and fortunately we ve got a good Aussie contingent here. They re creating a good atmosphere for us and we re grateful for it.""",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-05-19/news_big_images/503829_50005396.jpg,Cricket,"""To score two hundreds in a match -- the first time I ve done that in any form of cricket in my life -- is very special and I m very proud.""",positive
'Like Christmas every day': Double ton Smith revels in 'dream' Test return,"
BIRMINGHAM (AFP) – Australia’s Steve Smith insisted he had never lost faith in his ability as his ""dream comeback"" to Test cricket continued with a second hundred in the Ashes opener at Edgbaston.
Smith made 142 in Australia’s second innings 487-7 declared on Sunday after the star batsman’s 144 bailed them out to 284 following a collapse to 122-8 in their first innings.
With Matthew Wade making 110 on the fourth day as well, Australia set England an imposing target of 398.
Former Australia captain Smith and then deputy David Warner were both given 12-month bans for their roles in a ball-tampering scandal last year, with Cameron Bancroft -- who actually applied sandpaper to the ball during a Test against South Africa in Cape Town -- hit with a nine-month suspension by Cricket Australia.
All three batsmen are making their Test returns in this match, although Smith and Warner’s international comeback came during the World Cup, where Australia lost to eventual champions England in an Edgbaston semi-final last month.
‘Incredibly special’
""I’ve never doubted my ability,"" Smith told reporters after stumps.
""But, it’s kind of a dream comeback in a way. To be able to score two hundreds in a match, in the first Ashes match, it’s something I have never done in any form of cricket before in my life. It’s incredibly special.""
He added: ""It feels like Christmas morning every morning getting to come and do this.""
Sunday was also memorable for Wade, once Australia’s wicketkeeper but now selected as a specialist batsman.
Wade, whose hundred was his first in Ashes cricket, had the best view at a packed Edgbaston while helping Smith add 126 for the fifth wicket, but said batting with him could be difficult.
""It’s daunting to be honest,"" he explained. ""Sometimes he makes it look way too easy and it hurts.
""He said to me the other day at breakfast he’d never scored a hundred in both innings of a Test match.
""When he said that, I thought we were going to be in for something special.""
England batting coach Graham Thorpe praised Smith’s two innings by saying: ""In many ways you have to admire it and appreciate you are watching someone who is a fantastic player.""
England were without James Anderson for the whole of Australia’s second innings after their all-time leading Test wicket-taker remained sidelined with a calf injury that meant he bowled just four overs in the match.
Anderson missed last week’s Test win over Ireland with calf trouble but former England batsman Thorpe defended the decision to bring him back for this match.
""A guy who has played as many Test matches as he has, we have to trust his view,"" he insisted.
England will resume Monday on 13-0, with Rory Burns, fresh from his maiden Test century in the first innings, and Jason Roy at the crease.
Only one of England’s previous 33 home Tests has ended in a draw but Thorpe backed his side to bat out the day.
""We have got the character and the challenge is ahead of our guys tomorrow,"" he said. ""It will not be easy but this is Test cricket."" ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-05-19/news_big_images/503726_99112232.jpg,Cricket,"Wade, whose hundred was his first in Ashes cricket, had the best view at a packed Edgbaston while helping Smith add 126 for the fifth wicket, but said batting with him could be difficult.",positive

India defeat West Indies in rain-hit Florida T20,"
LAUDERHILL (AFP) - Rohit Sharma led from the front as India defeated the West Indies in a rain-affected second fixture of the three-match T20 International series at the Central Broward Stadium in Florida on Sunday.
Opening batsman Sharma blazed 67 off 51 balls, with three sixes and six fours embellishing his entertaining innings, in pacing India to 167 for five after captain Virat Kohli chose to bat first.
Despite a bludgeoning 54 from Rovman Powell, West Indies were kept in check at 98 for four off 15.3 overs when the inclement weather intervened.
Torrential showers prevented any further play and India were declared winners by 22 runs on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method as West Indies needed to be at 121 to be ahead on run-rate when play was halted.
Having won the low-scoring first match of the series by four wickets at the same venue a day earlier, India will now be pursuing a clean sweep of the series when the final match is played at the Providence Stadium in Guyana on Tuesday.
Sharma dominated an opening stand of 67 with Shikhar Dhawan and looked on course for a hundred when a miscued swing at Oshane Thomas resulted in a comfortable catch for Shimron Hetmyer at extra-cover.
Thomas also removed Rishabh Pant cheaply and the West Indies did a better containing job in the second half of the innings except for the final over when three sixes were hoisted off Keemo Paul.
Paul dismissed Dhawan for 23 and left-arm fast bowler Sheldon Cottrell claimed the prized wicket of Kohli (28) and doubled his wicket tally in removing Manish Pandey to a wicketkeeper s catch.
After going almost four overs without finding the boundary ropes Krunal Pandya heaved two sixes and Ravindra Jadeja added another in Paul s expensive finale to the innings.
Faced with a daunting target, and mindful of the potential threat of rain, West Indies suffered two early setbacks with Evin Lewis and Sunil Narine both falling cheaply.
Narine was promoted to open the batting for this match with John Campbell dropped to accommodate an additional spinning option for the Caribbean side in left-armer Khary Pierre.
Powell and Nicholas Pooran tried to get their team back on course with a 76-run third-wicket partnership.
But they failed to score quickly enough to put their opponents under any real pressure. Pooran was the main stumbling block as his 19 runs came off 34 deliveries while Powell raced to 54 off the same number of balls.
He lost Pooran to a well-judged catch by Manish Pandey on the long-on boundary before falling as well leg-before to the same bowler, Krunal Pandya. His entertaining innings included three sixes and six fours.
There was no time for Kieron Pollard and Shimron Hetmyer to get into stride as the forecasted thundershowers closed in to wash away any prospect of the remaining overs being bowled.

Gibson exits as South Africa adopt football-style management structure,"
CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa will radically overhaul their management team, including saying goodbye to coach Ottis Gibson, as they instead move to a football-style new structure.
West Indian Gibson will not have his contract renewed after a disappointing World Cup in England, where the Proteas won only three of their nine matches and were never in the hunt for the semi-finals.
“Members of (the current) team management, including the various assistant cricket coaches, will not be retained as part of the forthcoming plan,” Cricket South Africa (CSA) said in a media release on Sunday.
CSA will instead appoint a team manager, who will select his own coaching staff and captains in the three formats of the game.
The medical staff and administrative staff will also report to him.
The team manager will report to CSA Acting Director of Cricket, Corrie van Zyl, who will in turn report to the Chief Executive.
The structure will be similar to that at top European football clubs where a technical director takes charge of the coaching staff and players.
While CSA advertise the positions of Director of Cricket, team manager and convener of selectors, Van Zyl will appoint an interim management team, selection panel and captain for the three-test tour of India in September and October.
“This change will herald an exciting new era for the SA cricket and will bring us into line with best practice in professional sport,” CSA Chief Executive Thabang Moroe said.
“I must stress that the new structure was not a rash decision. It was taken after much deliberation by the Board, taking all the factors into consideration about the current state of our cricket and also the plan that we need to get to within the timelines we have set.
“I would like to thank Ottis Gibson, other members of the team’s current senior management, and our long-serving team manager, Dr. (Mohammed) Moosajee, for their national service to South African cricket.”

Smith ton helps Australia dominate England in Ashes opener,"
BIRMINGHAM (AFP) - Steve Smith hit his second century of his comeback Test on Sunday as Australia set England a daunting 398 to win the Ashes opener at Edgbaston.
Ashes-holders Australia, bidding to win their first Test series away to England in 18 years, made 487-7 declared in their second innings as they capitalised on the absence from the home side s attack of the injured James Anderson.
That left England needing 398 for victory -- the most they have made in the fourth innings to win a Test was 332-7 against Australia at Melbourne back in 1928/29.
Australia captain Tim Paine s declaration late on the fourth day left England with an awkward seven overs to bat before stumps.
Rory Burns, fresh from his maiden Test century in the first innings, and Surrey teammate Jason Roy saw England to 13-0 at the close.
Smith made 142 following his 144 in the first innings of the match -- the former Australia captain s first Test since the end of a 12-month ban for his role in last year s ball-tampering scandal in South Africa.
He is just the fifth Australian to score hundreds in both innings of an Ashes Test.
Matthew Wade marked his first Test for nearly two years with a fine 110.
Smith, having reached lunch on 98 not out, went to three figures in style when he cover-drove England paceman Stuart Broad for his 10th four in 147 balls faced.

Smith celebrates

He celebrated by removing his batting helmet and waving his bat joyously towards the Australia changing room.
And while there was applause from a packed crowd, there were also renewed chants of ""Crying on the telly, we saw you crying on the telly"" in a reference to the emotional press conference Smith gave in Sydney after he was sent home from South Africa.
""When he goes out to bat, it s almost like he s in a trance-like state,"" former Australia captain Waugh told Channel Nine.
""He knows exactly what he s trying to do, exactly what the opposition are trying to do... he analyses every ball and it s like a computer, he spits out the answer,"" added Waugh, now a mentor to the Australia squad.
Smith has now scored 1,116 runs in his past 10 Ashes innings, a figure second only to the 1,236 made over the same span by Australia s Don Bradman -- widely regarded as Test cricket s greatest batsman.
England captain Joe Root brought himself on to bowl his part-time off-breaks and deployed Joe Denly s occasional leg-spin as frontline spinner Moeen Ali struggled to exert any control.
Wicketkeeper Wade, playing as a specialist batsman, with Paine behind the stumps, reverse-swept Root to complete a 70-ball fifty.
The new ball, however, did eventually give England the wicket they craved.
Chris Woakes got a delivery to deviate in the air outside off stump, with Smith edging an intended drive to wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow.
As Smith walked back after a 207-ball innings including 14 fours, the cheers at last drowned out the jeers.
Wade, who overturned an lbw decision on 69, reverse-swept Root for the 15th four of his innings to complete a 131-ball hundred, his third in Tests.
He holed out off Ben Stokes soon afterwards but it scarcely made any difference, with James Pattinson belting Broad for one of four sixes in his rapid 47 not out as England became increasingly ragged in the field.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-04-19/news_big_images/503697_92227915.jpg,Cricket,"Ashes-holders Australia, bidding to win their first Test series away to England in 18 years, made 487-7 declared in their second innings as they capitalised on the absence from the home side s attack of the injured James Anderson.",positive
"India's Irfan Pathan, others leave occupied Kashmir","
(Web Desk) – India’s former crickter Irfan Pathan and other support staffs of the occupied Kashmir’s cricket team were requested to “leave the state at the earliest” after the Indian government’s security advisory. 
According to Indian media reports, Irfan Pathan, the mentor of Jammu and Kashmir’s cricket teams across age-groups, left the state on Sunday due to the security advisory issued. The ongoing U-16 and U-19 trials in Srinagar have been postponed due to the situation. 
The administration had issued an advisory for all tourists and Amarnath pilgrims to leave due to a potential terror threat.
“We have for the time being postponed the second phase of junior team trials… However since there has been a government advisory, I had a meeting with Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) CEO Bukhari and administrator Justice Prasad. Accordingly, it was decided that boys need to be sent back home,” Irfan Pathan said.
Pathan reportedly left Srinagar only after all the boys from other regions reached home. “I myself personally ensured, at least for a few boys, that they can reach their homes safely. I can understand that their parents were tensed and rightly so. I called up some of them to confirm that they have indeed reached their homes. Now that everyone has left, I left today,” said Pathan.

Smith again frustrates England to leave test finely balanced,"
BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Steve Smith’s unbeaten 46 helped Australia recover to 124-3 in their second innings before bad light stopped play with the tourists 34 runs ahead at the end of day three of the first Ashes test at Edgbaston.
England’s first innings resumed on 267-4 as Rory Burns added eight to his overnight score, falling for 133.
However, England lost three wickets in 11 balls before Stuart Broad and Chris Woakes came to the rescue by adding 65 runs for the ninth wicket. England were eventually all out for 374.
The injured Jimmy Anderson was kept out of the bowling attack, with Broad opening, and he soon had his 450th test wicket as he enticed an edge from David Warner (8), with Cameron Bancroft next to go for seven to leave Australia 27-2.
Usman Khawaja (40) batted well before Ben Stokes had him caught behind.
But Smith, who scored a brilliant century in the first innings, once again proved immovable as he and Travis Head (21 not out) stayed at the crease until the umpires took the players off as daylight faded.
“Smithy is battling unbelievably,” James Pattinson said. “The best players stand up when it really matters, and he has done that here against England.”
England started well as Stokes passed 50 in front of a raucous crowd but nicked the ball through to Tim Paine the very next ball.
Burns’ innings then came to an end as he misjudged a Nathan Lyon delivery straight into Paine’s hands.
Lyon struck again in the same over when Moeen Ali was out for a five-ball duck. Australia kept up the pressure as Bairstow was dismissed in the next over for eight, with Peter Siddle claiming the wicket.
The middle-order collapse stalled England’s progress before Broad and Woakes kicked on.
Broad’s longest test innings in six years came to an end as he was caught on the boundary for 29.
Anderson was last to go for three, but the 37-year-old paceman’s calf injury kept him out of England’s bowling attack.
“It is well poised,” Woakes said. “It has been a great match so far.
“We leaked a couple too many tonight. But if we can start early in the morning, with two quick wickets first up then the partnership with Stuart could be a big part of the game.”",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-04-19/news_big_images/503614_69242773.jpg,Cricket,"The injured Jimmy Anderson was kept out of the bowling attack, with Broad opening, and he soon had his 450th test wicket as he enticed an edge from David Warner (8), with Cameron Bancroft next to go for seven to leave Australia 27-2.",positive
India snatch narrow win against West Indies in first T20,"
LAUDERHILL (AFP) -  India snatched a narrow win against West Indies by four wickets chasing 95 runs in the first fixture of their three-match T20 International series at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium in Florida on Saturday.
Navdeep Saini starred on his senior international debut with three important wickets as India limited the West Indies to 95 for nine.
Having already enjoyed success with the Indian ""A"" team currently on tour of the Caribbean, Saini made an immediate impact wearing his country’s colours at the highest level in claiming three for 17 off his four overs, including top-scorer Kieron Pollard who fell in the final over of the innings for 49.
He achieved the rarity of a maiden in the final over but it was his earlier double-strike which gave the 26-year-old fast bowler the sort of dream start he would have wished for after captain Virat Kohli chose to bowl first after winning the toss.
Opening bowlers Washington Sundar and Bhuvneshwar Kumar had already set the West Indies on the back foot by removing openers John Campbell and Evin Lewis and Saini added to the Caribbean side’s woes by dismissing attacking left-handers Nicholas Pooran and Shimron Hetmyer off successive deliveries.
Pooran’s score of 20 was the only other double-figure innings apart from Pollard in what was a generally indisciplined effort from the West Indies.
Kumar supported Saini’s effort with two wickets and indeed all India’s bowlers played key roles in depriving the West Indies’ big-hitters of opportunities to clear the boundary ropes.
West Indies, who are preparing for the defence of the World T20 title in Australia in 14 months’ time, welcomed back Pollard and spinner Sunil Narine in their line-up.
However injury-prone all-rounder Andre Russell was a late withdrawal from the squad and has been replaced by Jason Mohammed, who did not make the final 11 for the first of the back-to-back matches this weekend.
India’s inclusion of Saini is with an eye as well on the tournament next year.
Saini’s opportunity comes in the absence of Jasprit Bumrah, who will only feature in the Test leg of this tour while the absence of Hardik Pandya, who is rested from the entire campaign, gave Sundar a chance to impress in this opening match.

Ashes 2019: England 374 all out against Australia in first Test,"
BIRMINGHAM 2019 (AFP) - England were dismissed for 374 in reply to Australia’s first-innings 284, a lead of 90 runs, on the third day of the first Test at Edgbaston on Saturday.
Rory Burns batted for nearly eight hours to top-score with 133, his maiden Test hundred, in an innings where England captain Joe Root (57) and vice-captain Ben Stokes (50) both hit half-centuries.
England lost three wickets for four runs before lunch to slump to 300-8 -- just 16 runs ahead.
But a ninth-wicket stand of 65 between Chris Woakes, who made 37 not out on his Warwickshire home ground, and Stuart Broad (29) boosted their total.
Last man James Anderson came out to bat despite suffering a calf injury earlier in the match that meant England’s all-time leading Test wicket-taker only bowled four overs in Australia’s first innings.
Woakes then declined clear singles in what appeared to be both a bid to keep the strike and reduce the amount of running between the wickets required by Anderson, who was eventually last man out for three when caught slog-sweeping off Nathan Lyon.
Fast bowler Pat Cummins led Australia’s attack with 3-84 in 33 overs on an increasingly placid pitch, with off-spinner Lyon taking 3-112 in 43.5 overs.
Australia hold the Ashes but they have not won a Test series away to England for 18 years.
Nathan Lyon took two wickets in an over as Australia finally saw the back of Rory Burns during an England collapse in the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston on Saturday.
England were 328-8 at lunch on the third day, a first-innings lead of 44 runs, with Chris Woakes 13 not out and Stuart Broad 11 not out.
They had been hoping to build a substantial first-innings advantage but from 296-5 they lost three wickets for four runs in slumping to 300-8.
Stokes got England going on a sunny Saturday morning with an on-driven four off James Pattinson after the fast bowler came round the wicket.
A quick single then saw Stokes to a 95-ball fifty featuring eight fours.
But Stokes was out for exactly 50 to the next ball he faced when he cut loosely at Cummins and was caught behind by Australia captain and wicketkeeper Tim Paine.
Stokes, in his first match since being restored to the England vice-captaincy following an acquittal on a charge of affray last year, shared a stand of 88 with Burns that had taken England to 282-5.
New batsman Jonny Bairstow gave England the lead when he clipped Pattinson for four through midwicket.
Burns only managed three runs in Saturday’s first hour, before driving Peter Siddle for a four through cover-point.
But Lyon, who had repeatedly beaten Burns’s bat on Friday, finally ended the Surrey captain’s marathon innings when a delivery that turned and bounce took the outside edge and was well caught by Paine.
Burns faced 312 balls, with 17 fours.
By contrast, new batsman Moeen Ali lasted just five balls before he inexplicably shouldered arms to Lyon and was clean bowled for a duck -- the eighth time the spinner had dismissed him in 10 Ashes innings.
Then 300-7 became 300-8 when Bairstow’s reckless shot outside off stump against paceman Siddle was well caught at first slip by David Warner.
England now led by just 16 runs, with their two batsmen in the middle -- Woakes and Broad - then each on nought.
But Woakes, on his Warwickshire home ground, hoisted Lyon for a legside six to the delight of the crowd. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-03-19/news_big_images/503561_20851671.jpg,Cricket,Last man James Anderson came out to bat despite suffering a calf injury earlier in the match that meant England’s all-time leading Test wicket-taker only bowled four overs in Australia’s first innings.,positive

"Re-think neutral umpires, Ponting says after Ashes debacle","
(Reuters) - Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting has called for cricket to ditch its requirement for neutral umpires in the wake of a slew of poor decisions that blighted the opening day of the Ashes series.
Umpires Aleem Dar and Joel Wilson drew widespread criticism after a rocky day one at Edgbaston on Friday, with a number of their calls over-turned by the decision review system after Australia elected to bat.
English and Australian umpires dominate the ICC’s elite umpires panel but are ruled out of officiating the Ashes due to the global cricket’s requirement for neutral nation umpires to control matches.
“I would like to think the game has come far enough now for the game to not have neutral umpires,” Ponting told Cricket Australia’s website (cricket.com.au).
“People might say that with all the technology we’ve got now, it doesn’t matter that much.
“But it’s not a good spectacle when pretty obviously wrong decisions are made.
“There’s been a lot a negativity about the DRS over the years, but we’re pretty lucky that we had it last night.”
Ponting, part of the Cricket Committee at the MCC, the custodians of the Laws of Cricket, said he would raise the matter at the next MCC meeting.
“It’s already been spoken about a lot among the players,” he said.
“If it’s not brought up, I’ll make sure it’s added to the agenda.
“Surely (English umpire) Richard Kettleborough and the like would want to be umpiring the best series.
“The best umpires can end up missing out on all the big tournaments.
“It could force umpires into retirement a bit early.”
Australia were bowled out for 284, with England 10 for no loss at stumps.
Umpiring standards were put in the spotlight after the World Cup final between England and New Zealand at Lord’s last month, with Ben Stokes erroneously awarded an extra run by the standing umpires in the 50th over of the home side’s chase.
England went on to win the match by total boundaries scored after a tied Super Over.  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-03-19/news_big_images/503494_80353424.jpg,Cricket,"“I would like to think the game has come far enough now for the game to not have neutral umpires,” Ponting told Cricket Australia’s website (cricket.com.au).",negative
"Shakib wants rotation policy to preserve players, boost bench","
DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh should adopt a rotation policy to prolong the careers of their top players and unearth new talents, premier all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan has said.
The 32-year-old, undoubtedly the best cricketer Bangladesh has ever produced, was granted a break from the team’s short tour of Sri Lanka for three one-day internationals after his heroics at the World Cup in England.
“A player can’t play all the time, they need to take breaks,” he told reporters in Dhaka.
“The responsibility falls on both sides. It is also the responsibility to understand (when) a player is saying that I need or a break, or the coaching staff is telling a player, you need a break. So both sides must understand.”
The southpaw cited the example of India and said a rotation policy would boost bench strength for the South Asian country where cricket is the most popular sport.
“I will give you an example from India. Their players had the least injuries in their history last year. One of the main reason was their rotation policy. It helped them build many players who got exposure,” Shakib said.
“At the same time, their players were fresh when they came to the side. Everyone, including Virat Kohli, got rested for one of the formats.
“When these breaks are in place, you can give more opportunity to players and you will have players in the pipeline as well. So we have to plan by looking at the bigger picture.”
Bangladesh witnessed a spate of injuries to their players during the World Cup, where they finished eighth among 10 teams.
Shakib was the lone shining light for Bangladesh during the tournament, finishing third on the run-getters’ list with 606 runs from eight innings while also picking up 11 wickets with his left-arm orthodox spin bowling.
He pleaded for all the stakeholders of the game to be on the same page to take cricket forward in Bangladesh.
“If we are to do this, we must have very good coordination between coaching staff, board and players,” he said. “Otherwise there will be criticism if the right message is not sent.

Burns's maiden Test century frustrates Australia,"
BIRMINGHAM (AFP) - Rory Burns s unbeaten maiden Test century saw him defy Australia for more than six-and-a-half hours as he led a determined England batting effort in the Ashes opener at Edgbaston on Friday.
England were 267-4 at stumps on the second day of the first Test, just 17 runs behind Australia s first-innings 284.
Ashes debutant Burns was 125 not out, with the Surrey left-handed opener, whose innings started on Thursday, receiving a huge ovation from the crowd as he walked off
England vice-captain Ben Stokes was 38 not out, having helped Burns add an unbroken 73.
Australia s total had been built on a superb 144 from Steve Smith in the former captain s first Test since a 12-month ban for his role in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa.
England, dismissed for just 85 in the first innings of their Test win against Ireland at Lord s last week, resumed on 10-0 with Burns four not out and Surrey team-mate Jason Roy on six.
Roy made a blistering 85 in eventual champions England s World Cup semi-final win over Australia at Edgbaston last month.
But he never looked comfortable on Friday and, on 10, he edged fast bowler James Pattinson low to Smith at second slip, with England then 22-1.
Captain Joe Root had returned to No 3 in a bid to lead from the front.
But he was almost bowled leaving off-spinner Nathan Lyon s sharply turning first ball.
The star batsman had an even luckier break on nine when given out caught behind off Pattinson only for his review to reveal the ball had hit the off stump without dislodging a bail.
Meanwhile Burns was content to pick off anything loose, including an over-pitched ball from Pat Cummins he on-drove for four.
Root had another moment of good fortune when given out lbw to recalled paceman Peter Siddle on 14.
But in a match already full of overturned decisions, his immediate review revealed an inside edge.
Root cashed in as he too, like Burns, completed a 110-ball fifty.
But frustratingly for Root, whose conversion rate of fifties to hundreds is relatively poor -- 42 to 16 -- he fell soon afterwards when he chipped a Siddle slower ball back to the bowler, who took a fine one-handed catch to end a second-wicket partnership of 132.
Australia s pacemen allowed Burns, who unusually tilts his head towards the right before every ball he faces in a bid to compensate for a dominant left eye, to settle by repeatedly bowling around the wicket and so feeding him runs on the legside.
By the time they went over the wicket to him, Burns was well set.
Nevertheless Burns, whose previous highest score in eight Tests was the 84 he made against the West Indies at Bridgetown in January, still spent 36 balls in the  nervous 90s .
But a quick single off Lyon eventually saw Burns, the man whom England hope will fill a position at opener that has become even more of a problem for them since their all-time leading run-scorer Alastair Cook s international retirement last year, to three figures in 224 balls including 14 fours.
Earlier, Burns could only watch as Joe Denly and Jos Buttler fell cheaply after tea to leave England 194-4.
But all-rounder Stokes helped revive the innings.
The left-handed batsman hit several boundaries off second-string bowling on a sunny afternoon as Australia looked to speed up their over-rate.
And when the tourists took the new ball on a relatively placid pitch, Stokes drove Cummins down the ground for four to huge cheers from fans in the raucous Hollies Stand.
Australia hold the Ashes but they have not won a Test series away to England in 18 years.

Jason Mohammed replaces injured Russell in West Indies T20 squad,"
LAUDERHILL (AFP) - West Indies called up Jason Mohammed on Friday as cover for the injured Andre Russell for this weekend s two T20 matches against India in the United States.
Mohammed, 32, has captained West Indies in both limited-overs formats and returns to the international fold for the first time since July 2018.
Russell had originally been selected despite continuing his recovery from a knee injury that saw him leave the World Cup early.
He withdrew from the squad for the India series after experiencing discomfort while playing at the T20 tournament in Canada.
""We welcome Jason Mohammed into the squad for the first two T20 matches here in Florida. He is a player with lots of experience in all three formats,"" said interim West Indies head coach Floyd Reifer.
""It is not easy to the fill the shoes of someone like Andre Russell, who has dominated T20 cricket all over the world and helped West Indies win the ICC T20 World Cup on two occasions.
""We believe Jason is capable of good performances and we back him to perform at this level and win games as well.""
The first two T20s against India will take place on August 3 and 4 at the Broward County Stadium in Lauderhill, Florida, with the third to be held in Guyana.
The two sides will also contest three ODIs and two Tests.

England paceman Wood out for the season,"
LONDON (AFP) - England fast bowler Mark Wood will play no part in the ongoing Ashes series after suffering a left knee injury while helping his country win the World Cup last month.
The Durham quick helped tournament hosts England win the World Cup for the first time, taking 18 wickets at an average of 25.72.
Wood was not included in England s team for the first Test at Edgbaston currently in progress and was already set to miss the Ashes matches at Lord s and Headingley because of a left side strain he sustained during a World Cup final win over New Zealand.
England announced on Friday that Wood had been struggling with a knee problem as well as a longstanding ankle injury.
""England fast bowler Mark Wood has had left knee surgery to address an injury sustained during the ICC Cricket World Cup,"" said a team statement.
""The Durham player will continue rehabilitation for this and the left side strain that he sustained in the World Cup final.
""As a result of these injuries, he will be unavailable for any cricket for the remainder of the season.""

Trump cheers as rapper A$AP Rocky freed in Swedish assault case,"
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) – U.S. rapper A$AP Rocky and two of his friends were released from custody in Sweden on Friday three days into their highly publicised assault trial, a development hailed by President Donald Trump who had tried to intervene in the case.
The judge, Per Lennerbrant, said the three were free to leave the country ahead of his verdict due on Aug. 14 - a ruling that in Sweden often points to an acquittal or a sentence that is less than the time that defendants have already served.
Trump tweeted: “A$AP Rocky released from prison and on his way home to the United States from Sweden. It was a Rocky Week, get home ASAP A$AP!”
A$AP Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, took off by plane from Stockholm’s Arlanda airport in the evening. Swedish media reported that he was leaving the country.
At the judge’s announcement, an emotional Mayers shared a long hug with his lawyer, then with his co-defendants, and then ran over to the courtroom gallery to hug his friends and family who cheered the decision.
Later on Instagram, Mayers thanked his friends and fans. “I want to thank the court for allowing me, Bladi and Thoto to return to our family and friends,” he added, referring to his co-defendants.
Mayers was detained following a brawl in downtown Stockholm on June 30. He and two of his entourage were charged with assault causing actual bodily harm. All three pleaded not guilty. The rapper told the court that he had acted in self-defence after his bodyguard was attacked.
The case has drawn huge media attention, particularly since Trump asked Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven to help free Mayers. Lofven declined, saying Sweden’s judiciary was independent.
“FREE ROCKY”
Around 20 A$AP Rocky fans had gathered outside the court on Friday chanting “Free Rocky” and playing his music.
Prosecutor Daniel Suneson earlier in the day called for six-month jail terms for Mayers and the two co-defendants on charges of beating up a 19-year-old man called Mustafa Jafari.
After the judge’s statement, the prosecutor said the release meant the court assessed there was no longer grounds for detention.
“I do not want to speculate on whether they will be convicted or acquitted, we will have to await the court’s ruling,” he said.
The prosecution had argued that after an argument, Mayers threw Jafari to the ground, after which he and two of his entourage kicked and punched the teenager. In his testimony, Jafari said he was also hit on the head with a bottle after he followed Mayers’ group.
Mayers acknowledged in court on Thursday that he threw Jafari to the ground and punched and kicked him, but said the teenager had attacked his bodyguard. He said he had tried to avoid the fight and denied hitting Jafari with a bottle.
Mayers, best known for his song “Praise the Lord”, had been in Stockholm for a concert. He has cancelled several shows across Europe due to his detention.
Mayers’ spokeswoman said tour dates ten days from now were not cancelled.  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-03-19/news_big_images/503538_99462105.jpg,entertainment,"

The HFPA are a group of journalists who come from outside the US and report news from Hollywood to their territory.

Katy Perry and record label hit with $2.7 million copyright judgment,"
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A Christian rapper was awarded $2.7 million on Thursday by a Los Angeles jury that found that Katy Perry’s 2013 hit “Dark Horse” contained a musical passage from one of his songs.

The verdict, reported by Los Angeles City News Service, followed a copyright trial in which Marcus Gray, known as Flame, said the beat in his song “Joyful Noise” was lifted and used in Perry’s single.

The jury last week ruled that the short passage in the two songs was identical.

Perry, who was not in federal court for the damages decision, testified last month that she believed “Dark Horse” was an original work. The song was created by her producers and writers after she was presented with a series of short instrumental passages, the pop star testified.

Her attorney said she would appeal.

“The writers of `Dark Horse’ consider this a travesty of justice,” attorney Christine Lepera told reporters outside the court, City News reported.

“Dark Horse” brought in about $31 million for record label Capitol Records, a unit of Universal Music Group, attorneys for both sides agreed during the trial. Perry earned about $3.2 million.

On Thursday, Capitol Records was ordered to pay $1.2 million in damages to Gray, while Perry was ordered to pay $550,000. Producers and other collaborators on the song were told to pay the balance of the $2.7 million award.

Flame, 37, from St. Louis, Missouri, released his first album in 2004 and has had several hits on the Billboard gospel and Christian charts, but is little known outside of that genre.

Perry, 34, rose to fame in 2008 with the single “I Kissed a Girl” and went on to become one of the best-selling female pop stars in the world. She was also a judge for three seasons of the TV talent show “American Idol.” ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-02-19/news_big_images/503345_74649551.jpg,entertainment,"

Broadway icon Harold Prince dead at 91,"
NEW YORK (AFP) - Broadway director and producer Harold Prince -- who brought some of the most successful musicals ever to the stage including ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and won a record 21 Tony awards -- died Wednesday after a short illness. He was 91.
Tributes poured in for Prince, whose glittering career lasted more than 60 years and featured several hit collaborations with fellow musical theater royalty Stephen Sondheim (""Company"" and ""Sweeney Todd"") and Andrew Lloyd Webber (""Phantom"" and ""Evita"").
Lloyd Webber described him as ""the prince of musicals.""
""This wonderful man taught me so much and his mastery of musical theater was without equal,"" the British composer wrote on Twitter.
Prince -- called ""Hal"" by those close to him -- passed away in Reykjavik, Iceland, his publicist said in a statement emailed to AFP.
He leaves behind his wife of 56 years, Judy; a son and a daughter, and three grandchildren.
""As per his wishes, there will be no funeral but there will be a celebration of his life this fall with the people he loved most, the members of the theatrical community that he was a part of for seven decades,"" the spokesman said.
Prince was born in New York on January 30, 1928, getting his first foot through the theater door as an assistant to producer-director George Abbott in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
He shot to fame as a co-producer of Abbott s ""The Pajama Game,"" which won the 1955 Tony for best musical.
Prince enjoyed further success with ""Cabaret"" in 1966 before starting a long and fruitful partnership with Sondheim, which brought a string of accolades.
Their 1970 comedy ""Company"" won six Tony awards, including best musical. ""Follies,"" which opened the following year, went one better, picking up seven Tonys.
""A Little Night Music"" (1973) and ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" (1979) both won Tonys for best musical. The latter also collected an Olivier Award for Best New Musical.
Prince directed Lloyd Webber s hit musicals ""Evita"" (1978 in London s West End) and ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" which opened in London in 1986 and went on to become the longest-running show in Broadway history.
He received a special Tony Award for lifetime achievement in 2006.
""I am saddened beyond words,"" said actress-dancer Chita Rivera, who starred in the Prince-directed London and Broadway productions of ""Kiss of the Spider Woman.""
""There are some people you feel we will never be without. Hal is one of them. I owe so much to him. He knows my love for him.""

Yasir discloses to have gotten engaged with Iqra in Feb,"
(Web Desk) – Yasir Hussain announced on Instagram that he and Iqra Aziz got engaged back in February in a private event with friends and family.

He put down all the controversy surrounding the couples LSA public declaration of their love for each other, which caught the media’s eye and also was subject to criticism by cybernauts.
In his post, he denounced those who were jealous, making unnecessary comments and passing on judgements without any rhyme or reason.
‘Doston I’m in love and alhamdulillah I’m happy . Aap log Khush ho ya Jal k kukkar ban jao , dil mai bura samjho ya Pagal ho k Sarak pe nikal jao . Mai ne ab tak bhi apni zindagi apni marzi se guzari hai aur aagy bhi aisy hi karonga. Khushyon mai shareek hona seekhen .. Khush rahengy.’
He also asked people to try to be happy for others instead of picking on them.
‘Yeh tasweeren Feb mai hui baat pakki ki hain . Mangni aap log angoothi pehnany ko kehty hain toh woh sari dunya k samny kia . Lekin aap logon ne meri zindagi ko subject bana k study karna shuru kar dia hai us se aap logon ki faraghat bhari zindagi ka bakhoobi andaza ho raha hai,’ he added.
Yasir also mentioned that Iqra was surprised at my proposal because she did not know that I was going to make a public spectacle.
‘Aur awards pe iqra is liye Heran thi k usy nahi pata tha k mai itny logon k samny usy angothi pehnaonga.’

Govinda reveals reason behind not acting in blockbuster 'Avatar',"
MUMBAI (Dunya News) – Bollywood actor Govinda, while revealing the reason behind not signing James Cameron’s blockbuster film ‘Avatar’, said that he refused the offer as he couldn’t set aside 410 days for the shooting.
In a television show, Govinda said that he rejected the main role in the Avatar because he was not okay with the use of body paint.
He also claimed that he suggested the movie name to Cameron.
""I gave the title of the film (Avatar). It turned out to be a super hit film. I told him (James Cameron) that the film will do really well. I told him that I feel it will take seven years for him to complete the film. He got angry.

Miley Cyrus latest star to abandon Woodstock 50,"
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Miley Cyrus was reported on Tuesday to have pulled out of the troubled Woodstock 50 festival, joining a string of other big names who say they will no longer take part in the official event meant to mark the anniversary of the landmark 1969 music festival.

Cyrus, one of America’s biggest pop stars, was one of the headliners for the event planned for Aug. 16-18, which has been mired in financial and permit problems.

Variety and Rolling Stone cited sources close to the situation as saying Cyrus would no longer take part. Representatives of the “Wrecking Ball” singer did not return requests for comment.

Rapper Jay-Z withdrew last week, along with former Creedence Clearwater Revival frontman John Fogerty as Woodstock 50 organizers sought a third venue, this time at a small amphitheater in Columbia, Maryland. 

In the past few days Dead & Company, Carlos Santana, and rock bands the Lumineers and the Raconteurs have also pulled out, their representatives told Rolling Stone magazine.

Tickets have yet to go on sale for the festival, which, according to media reports, may now be a free, one-day event with an attendance scaled down from more than 100,000 to around 30,000.

Woodstock 50, with an 80-act lineup, was first planned for the Watkins Glen motor racing venue in upstate New York, but the site pulled out in June. Organizers then attempted in vain to seek permits in Vernon, New York.

The proposed new venue is the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Maryland.

The nonprofit Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, the current owner of the field where the 1969 Woodstock festival took place, has also scaled back plans for a three-day anniversary event. It said in February it will instead host separate concerts by Ringo Starr, Santana and the Doobie Brothers.

Astronomers find that Milky Way is a warped and twisted galaxy,"
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Astronomers have created the most precise map to date of the Milky Way by tracking thousands of big pulsating stars spread throughout the galaxy, demonstrating that its disk of myriad stars is not flat but dramatically warped and twisted in shape.
The researchers on Thursday unveiled a three-dimensional map of the Milky Way - home to more than 100 billion stars including our sun - providing a comprehensive chart of its structure: a stellar disk comprised of four major spiral arms and a bar-shaped core region.

“For the first time, our whole galaxy - from edge to edge of the disk - was mapped using real, precise distances,” said University of Warsaw astronomer Andrzej Udalski, co-author of the study published in the journal Science.
Until now, the understanding of the galaxy’s shape had been based upon indirect measurements of celestial landmarks within the Milky Way and inferences from structures observed in other galaxies populating the universe. The new map was formulated using precise measurements of the distance from the sun to 2,400 stars called “Cepheid variables” scattered throughout the galaxy.
“Cepheids are ideal to study the Milky Way for several reasons,” added University of Warsaw astronomer and study co-author Dorota Skowron. “Cepheid variables are bright supergiant stars and they are 100 to 10,000 times more luminous than the sun, so we can detect them on the outskirts of our galaxy. They are relatively young - younger than 400 million years - so we can find them near their birthplaces.”

The astronomers tracked the Cepheids using the Warsaw Telescope located in the Chilean Andes. These stars pulsate at regular intervals and can be seen through the galaxy’s immense clouds of interstellar dust that can make dimmer stellar bodies hard to spot.
The map showed that the galaxy’s disk, far from flat, is significantly warped and varies in thickness from place to place, with increasing thickness measured further from the galactic center. The disk boasts a diameter of about 140,00 light years. Each light year is about 6 trillion miles (9 trillion km).

The Milky Way began to form relatively soon after the Big Bang explosion that marked the beginning of the universe some 13.8 billion years ago. The sun, located roughly 26,000 light years from the supermassive black hole residing at the center of the galaxy, formed about 4.5 billion years ago.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-06-19/news_big_images/503896_96614778.jpg,Technology,"

"Teams give approval for 22-race calendar, says Mercedes boss","
BUDAPEST (AFP) - Formula One teams have given their approval in principal to an expanded 22-race calendar next year without any allowance for an additional power-unit, Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff has said.
Speaking after a teams’ meeting with F1 chief executive Chase Carey at the Hungarian Grand Prix, Wolff was quoted on Sunday saying the 22-race plan with no extra engines - and therefore costs for the smaller customer teams -- was supported.
""In a nutshell, we basically agreed to have a 22nd race,"" said Wolff, as quoted by Autosport (www.autosport.com).
""We’ve got to let Liberty do their business and their business is to grow F1.
""If they are able to attract promoters, we’ve got to support them so, we shouldn’t change the technical regulations because we have an extra race. That was the debate we had.""
Wolff added that an increase to the duration of the season and number of races should not be interpreted as a chance for more components to be used on the cars.
""It shouldn’t be seen as an opportunity to increase the number of components, but equally we’ve got to protect our people and all of us because it could get to a point where it’s not manageable any more with one single crew.
""That becomes a factor that needs a solution.""
Support from the Catalan government for the continuation of the Spanish Grand Prix this week suggested an expansion of the existing 21-race calendar was inevitable.
The enlargement requires approval from the teams, a factor that precipitated the meeting on Saturday.
The expansion may lead to an increase in the number of ‘double-headers’ formed of two successive race weekends in a calendar due to include a return of the Dutch Grand Prix and a Vietnam Grand Prix for the first time.
Wolff also said Mercedes were not considering promoting impressive young British rookie George Russell from Williams to the main factory team alongside Lewis Hamilton next season.
He has made clear that current driver Valtteri Bottas is under consideration to retain his seat, but that a final choice between him and highly-rated reserve driver Esteban Ocon is due to be made during the sport’s European summer break this August.
Russell on Saturday out-qualified his Williams team-mate Robert Kubica by 1.3 seconds to take 15th place on the grid, the team’s best effort this year.
""I think you’ve got to consider that these guys come into F1 at a very young age,"" said Wolff. ""And, yes, there are exceptions to the norm, such as Max Verstappen.""
He said the 21-year-old Dutch tyro, who will start Sunday’s Hungarian Grand Prix from his maiden pole position, had benefitted from being allowed to learn and make mistakes at both Toro Rosso and Red Bull.
""You’re not given the possibility to do that in a Mercedes because you’re being put in a car that is able to win races and championships, in a high-pressure environment.""
He said that putting Russell alongside ""the best driver of his generation who has been with us for seven years"", referring to Hamilton, could go terribly wrong for him.
""And I wouldn’t want to burn George."" ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-05-19/news_big_images/503734_97754694.jpg,Technology,"He said that putting Russell alongside ""the best driver of his generation who has been with us for seven years"", referring to Hamilton, could go terribly wrong for him.",positive
"Huawei tests smartphone with own operating system, possibly for sale this year: Chinese state media","
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd is testing a smartphone equipped with Hongmeng, the company’s self-developed operating system, which could potentially go on sale by the end of this year, Chinese state-media outlet Global Times reported.

The release of a Hongmeng-powered smartphone would mark a major step for China’s Huawei, the world’s second-biggest maker of smartphones, as U.S. government actions threaten its access to Google’s (GOOGL.O) Android operating system.
The device will be priced at around 2,000 yuan ($288), the Global Times said on Sunday, citing unnamed sources. That will place the device toward the low-end segment of the smartphone market.

Huawei did not immediately comment on the report when contacted by Reuters on Monday.

Huawei executives have previously described Hongmeng as an operating system designed for internet-of-things products. Last month the company said the first major devices powered by Hongmeng would be its upcoming line of Honor-brand smart TVs.

Company leaders have publicly downplayed the possibility that the software could power a smartphone.

Last week, at an event announcing the company’s earnings for the first half of 2019, Huawei chairman Liang Hua said the company preferred to use Google’s Android operating system for its mobile devices and referred to Hongmeng as part of Huawei’s “long-term strategy”.

Huawei has been at the center of geopolitical tension between the United States and China since May, when President Donald Trump placed the company on an “entity list” that effectively barred American suppliers from selling to the company.

Trump has signaled that the sanctions will be relaxed, although further details remain scarce. If the policies remain enforced, Huawei could potentially lose access to regular updates to Android.

Huawei’s revenue in the first half of 2019 grew 23%, in part due to strong domestic demand for its mobile phones.

While smartphone sales tanked overseas, its shipments in China increased 31% year-on-year in the June quarter, according to market research firm Canalys.

Analysts attribute the robust performance at home in part due to the quality of its devices, which have long led China’s high-end Android phone market, and in part due to patriotism among consumers. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-05-19/news_big_images/503732_15990419.jpg,Technology,"

Frenchman achieves 'dream' of first hoverboard Channel crossing,"
ST MARGARET’S BAY, United Kingdom (AFP) - A Frenchman who has spent years developing a jet-powered hoverboard zoomed across the English Channel on Sunday, fulfilling his quest just 10 days after failing in a first attempt when he fell into the water while trying to refuel.
Franky Zapata set off on his ""Flyboard"" from Sangatte on the northern coast of France at 8:17 am (0617 GMT) for the 35-kilometre (22-mile) trip to St. Margaret’s Bay in Dover, on England’s south coast.
Escorted by three helicopters, he glided across the water in the early morning light and landed 22 minutes later in the picturesque bay, where dozens of onlookers and journalists awaited him.
""Everything went great! Even though it was still tricky,"" Zapata said after the flight, referring to a complex landing manoeuvre on a boat around three-quarters of the way across to pick up a fresh backpack full of kerosene.
He said that based on the indicators in the visor of his helmet, he raced over the busy shipping lane at a speed of 160-170 km/h (100-105 mph), doing zig-zags as he neared the coast.
""Then I saw England getting closer, so I tried to have some fun so I could forget the pain -- my legs were on fire!"" he said.
He later broke down in tears of emotion while talking on the telephone to his son, who told him, ""Dad, you’re the best!""
""Frankly, I’m tired,"" he said later. ""I need a holiday.""

‘My dream’

Zapata, a 40-year-old former jet-ski champion, first tried to make the crossing on July 25, to coincide with the 110th anniversary of Louis Bleriot’s historic first crossing of the Channel by plane.
But the bid was cut short when he tumbled into the water after failing to land on a boat to refuel -- his backpack carries some 35 kilogrammes (77 pounds) of kerosene, enough to keep him aloft for around 10 minutes.
Asked if he considered himself Bleriot’s successor, Zapata told BFM television later Sunday: ""It’s not really comparable, he was one of the first men to fly.""
""Let’s just say that I achieved my dream.""
This time the refuelling boat was bigger and had a larger landing area, and French navy vessels in the area kept an eye out in case of trouble.
French maritime authorities gave Zapata’s team permission to keep the refuelling boat in French waters, something they had refused the first time around citing safety concerns.
Zapata’s team had been racing to repair the hoverboard after it was damaged from falling in the Channel waters 10 days ago.
The main uncertainty this time around, Zapata had warned before the second attempt, was that his hoverboard might end up having ""a little problem.""
But he said Sunday that his team had worked around the clock since the first attempt ten days ago, spending 15 to 16 hours a day on rebuilding the craft after it was damaged in the water.

‘My life’s work’

Zapata has been developing his hoverboard for the past three years, despite losing two fingers during its maiden flight in his garage near Marseille, when they got sucked into the turbines.
He already holds the Guinness World Record for the farthest hoverboard flight, a 2.2-kilometre trip over the Mediterranean Sea in April 2016.
No Guinness adjudicator was on hand for the latest Channel attempt, though a spokeswoman said he could still be awarded a new record if the trip meets its guidelines.
Zapata burst into the spotlight at this year’s July 14 Bastille Day military parade in Paris, where he and his craft soared noisily above a crowd of stunned onlookers that included French President Emmanuel Macron.
His device has also captured the attention of the French military, which in December gave Zapata’s company, Z-AIR, a 1.3 million euro ($1.4 million) development grant.
Defence Minister Florence Parly told France Inter radio that it might eventually serve a variety of purposes, ""for example as a flying logistical platform or, indeed, as an assault platform.""
""I can’t help it, the first time I saw it fly I said, ‘This is going to be my life’s work’,"" Zapata told the French online media site Brut in a recent interview.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-04-19/news_big_images/503616_37892726.jpg,Technology,"But he said Sunday that his team had worked around the clock since the first attempt ten days ago, spending 15 to 16 hours a day on rebuilding the craft after it was damaged in the water.",positive

Revolution of Earth and Venus forms a stunning pentagrammic pattern,"
(Web Desk) – As far back as our collective memory extends, we’ve been mesmerised by the dance of the planets across our skies. Even now, despite all our knowledge and technology, their basic movements can still surprise and captivate us.
The waltz between Earth and Venus around the Sun has been doing just that, for centuries - and it certainly does make a stunning pattern.
This viral gif, posted by Matthew Henderson on Tumblr, plots the midpoint between the two planets through time - Venus in orange and Earth in blue - as they follow their usual paths around the Sun.
As Henderson explains in the caption, ""eight Earth years are roughly equal to 13 Venus years, meaning the two planets approximately trace out this pattern with 5-fold symmetry as they orbit the Sun.""
The beautiful animation is based on data from University of Wisconsin geoscientist Steven Dutch, who created an interactive graphic in 2012, demonstrating how Venus’s closest orbital points to Earth, over eight years, map out the points of a ""remarkable, but not perfect"" pentagram in the sky.
""The orbits are approximated as circles, so this animation cannot be used for accurate predictions,"" Dutch stated.
All planets have elliptical orbits, making these diagrams simplified representations of the real deal. But they aren’t radically far off, especially in Venus’s case. Venus has the most circular orbit of any of the planets in our Solar System.
In a measure of eccentricity - how much an orbit deviates from a circle - Venus scores 0.007, whereas Mercury, with the most elliptical planetary orbit in our Solar System, has an eccentricity of 0.21. This measurement is the ratio between a planet’s farthest and nearest orbital point from the Sun, and gives a sense of how elongated the ellipse is.
Earth’s eccentricity is 0.0167, and the Sun isn’t central to this ellipse - it’s closer to one end. 

Another factor that would slightly skew the perfect symmetry depicted in the diagrams is that Venus’s orbit is at an angle of 3 degrees when compared to Earth’s.
We also must note that in the gif animation, the 8/13 orbit ratio between the two planets is slightly off, too. For every eight years on Earth, Venus experiences 13.004 years, which means the entire pattern rotates over time, like it does in Dutch’s original app.
But this idyllic five-fold symmetry is also observed when Earth is placed at the centre of the diagram (a geocentric perspective), known as the pentagram of Venus. Such patterns have fascinated professional and amateur astronomers for centuries - here’s what the geocentric motion of Mars looks like, as drawn by Johannes Kepler back in 1609.
The strange loops are not of Mars performing some sort of fancy orbital twirl, they’re just how the movements appear to us relative to both Earth’s and Mars’s movements.
The apparent switching of directions occurs from our perspective when we overtake a planet or it overtakes us, while both planets still travel in the same direction around their orbit at different speeds.
This is known as apparent retrograde motion, and has long been used as fodder for superstitions like astrology, with the nonsensical problem of ‘Mercury in retrograde’ now having become a full-blown meme.
Of course, modern technology now allows us to visualise these orbital patterns across much greater stretches of time, like the pretty and chaotic examples you can see here. But the only thing these gravity-bound planetary movements reflect is that patterns are a fundamental part of nature. And beautiful to look at, too.

(Web Desk) – Despite weighing less than one tenth of a gram, a new robot out of the University of California, Berkeley, can withstand the weight of a 60-kilogram (132-pound) person stepping on it — drawing comparisons to a well-known pest.
""People may have experienced that, if you step on the cockroach, you may have to grind it up a little bit, otherwise the cockroach may still survive and run away,"" researcher Liwei Lin said in a press release.
""Somebody stepping on our robot is applying an extraordinarily large weight, but [the robot] still works, it still functions.""
In a paper published on Wednesday in the journal Science Robotics, the UC Berkeley team describes how it built its roach-like robot out of a thin sheet of polyvinylidene fluoride coated in an elastic polymer.
When the researchers zap the robot with an oscillating electric voltage via an attached wire, its small body bends and straightens. This forces the bot to ""leapfrog"" forward on its single front leg.
Strength isn’t the only similarity between the robot and the insects some believe will inherit the Earth. It’s also extremely fast for its size, zipping along at a speed of about 20 body lengths per second.
This combination of toughness and speed could make the tiny bot ideal for search-and-rescue applications.
""For example, if an earthquake happens, it’s very hard for the big machines, or the big dogs, to find life underneath debris,"" researcher Yichuan Wu said in the press release, ""so that’s why we need a small-sized robot that is agile and robust.""

Petition to ban TikTok filed in Lahore High Court ,"
LAHORE (Dunya News) – A petition to ban the famous social media app TikTok was filed in the Lahore High Court (LHC) on August 3 citing obscenity and time wastage issues.
According to the details, petitioner Advocate Nadeem Sarwar took a stance that TikTok was spreading vulgarity along with wasting the time and money of the youth. He added that TikTok was further giving rise to blackmailing and harassment in society.
He requested the court to order Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to ban the app and Federal government to draft a privacy protection act to protect the younger generation from the negative effects of social media.
Applicant Nadeem made Federal government, Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) parties to the petition calling for a ban on the TikTok. “The court should stop the PEMRA from broadcasting TikTok videos,” Advocate Nadeem expressed.
It may be recalled that earlier in 2019, the Indian government had asked Google and Apple to take down popular Chinese short-video mobile application TikTok, said a report by Economic Times.
The development came when a court in Tamil Nadu ordered the Indian central government to prohibit TikTok downloads, saying the app was encouraging pornography and could expose children to sexual predators.
TikTok is a social media app for short-form mobile videos launched in China in September 2016 as ‘Douyin’ and one year later, it was introduced to globally as ‘TikTok’. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-03-19/news_big_images/503580_26106259.jpg,Technology,He requested the court to order Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to ban the app and Federal government to draft a privacy protection act to protect the younger generation from the negative effects of social media.,negative
Facebook expands 'She Means Business' women entrepreneurship program in Pakistan,"
LAHORE (Dunya News) – Facebook today (August 3) announced the expansion of its #SheMeansBusiness women entrepreneurship program in Pakistan by teaming up with Lahore Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
As per details, the program would provide women entrepreneurs with the tools, training and resources that can help them secure funding and grow their businesses.
“The flexibility offered by digital technologies is enabling a new generation of women entrepreneurs around the world to make positive contributions to their families and communities. However, women still face a number of obstacles such as a lack of funding and networks that can help them grow and scale. With this partnership, we want to nurture current and future generations of Pakistani women business leaders by providing access to a series of workshops and online learning tools,” said Facebook Asia Pacific Head of Community Affairs Beth Ann Lim during the launch of the program in Lahore.

According to the Future of Business Report – collaboration between Facebook, World Bank and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), women business owners on Facebook in Pakistan still face significant funding challenges, with less than one in five stating that they currently have a bank loan or a line of credit. Of those surveyed, over three in four Pakistani women business owners on Facebook say that social media helps their business.
WCCI President Dr Faaiza Amjad said online platforms such as Facebook have helped women entrepreneurs expand their businesses.
“When women are successful in their businesses, it drives social growth too; more women are employed, more diverse role models are created and there is stronger diversity. Successful female entrepreneurs invest in their communities and in educating children.
Run in collaboration with business leaders, civil society, NGOs and the public sector, #SheMeansBusiness is active in 21 countries around the world, including Pakistan, has trained more than 130,000 women in digital skills across Asia Pacific, reached 130,000 online through the #SheMeansBusiness resource hub.
“Through our partnership with #SheMeansBusiness, we will be able to help equip Pakistan’s women entrepreneurs with the knowledge, connections, skills and technology required to build and grow their businesses online.”
A range of studies, including those carried out by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, OECD, World Bank and International Finance Corporation in conjunction with McKinsey, reinforce the point that harnessing the economic potential of women can lead to substantial socio-economic gains.
According to a recent study by the Clinton Global Initiative, when women work they invest 90pc of their income back into their families, compared with 35pc for men.

US tariff threat may compound Apple's iPhone woes: BofA,"
(Reuters) - Apple Inc could see a hit to its annual earnings from U.S. President Donald Trump’s newly proposed 10% tariff on Chinese imports from Sept. 1, analysts from Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Friday.
“Our back of the envelope math suggests the impact (of the new tariffs) will be roughly $0.50-$0.75 (annualized per share) hit to earnings with roughly $0.30-$0.50 from iPhones,” the brokerage said.
Shares in Apple, which reported a surprise improvement in its fortunes in China earlier this week, sank 2.5% in morning trade, adding to similar losses a day earlier after Trump tore up a trade truce with China that had lasted just over a month.
The United States and China have been locked in a trade war marked by tit-for-tat tariffs since last year. The tensions have disrupted global supply chains and roiled financial markets.
The BofA note also provided for the possibility that Apple might raise prices of iPhones by around 10%, reducing demand by 20% or around 10 million units.
Apple effectively cut iPhone prices in China earlier this year after currency exchange rates had made the phones too expensive for many Chinese consumers.
Globally, iPhone sales fell 12% to $25.99 billion in the latest reported quarter, after dropping 17% in the second quarter. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-03-19/news_big_images/503549_43385940.jpg,Technology,Apple effectively cut iPhone prices in China earlier this year after currency exchange rates had made the phones too expensive for many Chinese consumers.,positive
Yellow lens glasses don't improve drivers' night vision,"
(Reuters Health) - - Touted to improve nighttime eyesight, yellow lens glasses don’t help drivers see better and may, in fact, worsen vision, a new study suggests.
Researchers found that yellow-lens wearing volunteers operating a driving simulator were no better at spotting a pedestrian when confronting oncoming headlights than those who wore clear lenses, according to the study published in JAMA Ophthalmology. And there was a suggestion that the yellow tinted lenses might even be making the situation worse.
Buyers of these products “have the concept that somehow these magic glasses can improve nighttime driving,” said the study’s lead author, Alex Hwang, an instructor in ophthalmology at the Harvard Medical School and an investigator at the Schepens Eye Research Institute at Massachusetts Eye and Ear. “Wearing (tinted) glasses, whether they are yellow, red or blue, cuts out a chunk of light. Which means this is the same as wearing sunglasses while driving at night.”
Hwang’s advice: “Don’t waste your money on these kinds of glasses for night driving.”
Despite there being no evidence of effectiveness, yellow-lens glasses are sold widely, Hwang noted.
An ad for one brand of yellow-lens glasses sold on Amazon claims that “night vision glasses help reduce night driving glare and eye strain, yellow lenses help to enhance night vision, improve color clarity and optical definition, enable to see better when driving at night or cloudy, rainy days, making night driving safer and easier.”
To determine whether yellow-lens glasses could actually improve drivers’ night vision, Hwang and his colleagues set up an experiment using a specially designed driving simulator that included the option of bright oncoming headlights.
The researchers recruited 22 volunteers who, wearing either one of three brands of yellow-lens glasses or clear glasses, completed a total of eight night driving scenarios, each of which lasted about 10 minutes. Of the 22, 18 were younger, with an average age between 27 and 28, while the other four, all men, had an average age of 70.
During the experiment, volunteers were told to press the horn as soon as they saw a pedestrian. Pedestrians were clad in either a dark blue navy shirt or an orange shirt. In some runs, the volunteers were subjected to bright headlights and in others they were “driving” in the dark.
While glare from headlights did seem to slow the speed with which the younger group spotted the pedestrian, wearing yellow-lenses did not improve things. In fact, the yellow lenses appeared to slow their response time, but that finding was not statistically significant. The findings were similar among the older volunteers, but their overall response time was slower than that of the younger volunteers both with and without the yellow lenses.
Dr. Douglas Frederick hopes drivers take note of the findings. “The biggest issue is that we don’t want people to have a false sense of security because they are using something that does not (improve vision),” said Frederick, deputy chair of education in the department of ophthalmology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai/New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. “Motor vehicle accidents involving pedestrians are a common problem.”
An important secondary finding is that “older people are more sensitive to headlight glare compared to younger people,” said Robert Masoff, a professor of ophthalmology at the Johns Hopkins Eye Institute and author of an editorial that accompanied the new study. “This is a real problem that needs to be addressed.”
The reason older people are more sensitive to bright headlights is that “changes occur in people’s lenses with aging,” Masoff said. Those changes lead to more glare, he explained. “Glare can cover up what you’re trying to see. It’s like having a dirty windshield. Cataract surgery may make things better for people, but that study hasn’t been done yet.”

Apple Card will not allow purchase of cryptocurrencies,"
(Reuters) - The Apple Inc credit card being launched with Goldman Sachs Group Inc will not allow the purchase of cryptocurrencies with the card, according to a customer agreement posted to Goldman’s website on Friday.
The Apple Card customer agreement said the card cannot be used to purchase cash advances or cash equivalents that include cryptocurrencies, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or lottery tickets. Goldman declined to comment and Apple did not immediately respond to request for comment.
The Apple Card is part of a broader effort by Apple to derive more of its revenue from services after years of heavily reliance on iPhone sales, which declined 12% in the most recent quarter.
For Goldman’s part, the Apple partnership is part of the longtime investment bank’s effort to build out a consumer-facing business.
Apple and Goldman are not alone in banning the purchase of cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin with credit cards.
Major American and British banks Lloyds Banking Group Plc and Virgin Money banned such purchases last year, following the lead of U.S. banking giants JP Morgan Chase & Co and Citigroup.

Facebook begins adding its name to some screens on Instagram,"
(Reuters) - Facebook Inc started adding its name to some screens on its Instagram photo-sharing platform this week, one of the first links it has given users to its ownership of the popular platform.
The move comes as the world’s largest social media company faces greater scrutiny from regulators around the world for more transparency over data privacy practices and how and with whom Facebook shares user information.
While not immediately visible to users, “Instagram from Facebook” can be seen a few clicks away at the bottom of the settings page in the Instagram app on some iOS devices.
“We want to be clearer about the products and services that are part of Facebook,” a company spokesman told Reuters.
Some U.S. lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, have pushed for action to break up Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google.
Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes in an opinion piece in the New York Times in May urged U.S. regulators to split the company in three.
Facebook will also add its name to its WhatsApp messaging service, The Information reported earlier on Friday.
Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, and each is now used by more than 1 billion people.
Instagram has become especially important in adding to Facebook’s revenue as the app largely stayed out of its parent’s privacy scandals, and it pulls in younger consumers at a much faster rate, attracting more advertisers.
Facebook in July said new rules and product changes aimed at protecting users’ privacy would slow its revenue growth into next year. It also agreed to pay $5 billion to settle a U.S. Federal Trade Commission data privacy probe.
The FTC is also investigating Facebook for anti-competitive behaviour.

Google to allow rivals to bid for place among default Android options,"
BRUSSELS/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Alphabet’s Google will allow rivals to buy the chance of winning default search engine status on new Android devices in Europe, the U.S. company said on Friday in its latest proposal to ward off fresh EU antitrust penalties.
New Android smartphones and tablets shipped in Europe will, from early 2020, be offered four options for their default search engine, Google said in a blog post
Search engine providers will be able to compete in a Google auction for a spot on a “choice screen” where users will select their preferred search engine from four options including Google.
The three highest bidders for a given country will appear on the choice screen, Google said.
Google’s move followed last year’s 4.34 billion euro ($4.81 billion) fine from the European Commission for blocking rivals by pre-installing its Chrome browser and Google search app on Android smartphones and notebooks.
The Commission said it would monitor the process closely. “The decision provides rival search providers the possibility to strike exclusive pre-installation deals with smartphone and tablet manufacturers. This was not possible before,” a spokesman said.
“We have seen in the past that a choice screen can be an effective way to promote user choice.” Czech search engine Seznam said it was not clear what the implications will be.
“It is hard to comment based on a screenshot and a few sentences. Seznam, and I believe others, too, were not contacted by Google about this proposition, so we have to wait for all-important details,” said Michal Feix, Seznam’s former chief executive and now partner at a consultancy advising the company.

Apple halts Siri response grading program after privacy concerns,"
(Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Friday it suspended its global program where it analyzed recordings from users interacting with its voice assistant Siri, after some privacy concerns were raised about the program.
Apple’s decision comes in the light of a report from in Guardian last week which said the company’s contractors around the globe tasked with reviewing the recordings regularly heard confidential information and private conversations.
“While we conduct a thorough review, we are suspending Siri grading globally,” an Apple spokeswoman said in a statement, adding that in a future software update, users will be able to opt out of the program.
Siri, Apple’s iconic voice assistant, allows users to work their iPhone without using their hands, and can send messages, make calls and open multiple applications with voice commands alone.
Consumers have become accustomed to calling out names for popular voice assistants, such as Amazon.com Inc’s Alexa, Google Inc’s Google Assistant, among others.
In an effort to perform quality checks and improve the voice assistant’s responses, contractors graded Siri’s answers to user queries, the Guardian reported. They also looked at whether the response was triggered accidentally, without a deliberate query from the user, the newspaper said.

'Fortnite' streaming star Ninja dumps Twitch for Mixer,"
SAN FRANCISCO (AFP) - ""Fortnite"" streaming superstar Tyler ""Ninja"" Blevins on Thursday left Amazon-owned Twitch, telling fans they will only be able to find him on rival gameplay streaming platform Mixer.
Blevins announced the move on Twitter, posting a video of a faux press conference at which he appeared to take questions from himself in disguises.
""I’ll be streaming on Mixer full time now,"" Blevins said on Twitter.
""I am freaking out, in the best of ways. I feel like I am going to get back to the streaming roots, and that is what it is all about.""
He promised his millions of fans that his broadcasts would remain the same, just that now they would be exclusively available at Microsoft’s Mixer social platform for gamers.
The move is a win for Microsoft, luring viewers to Mixer and playing into the technology company’s efforts to bolster its gaming community.
Microsoft’s Xbox line competes with PlayStation consoles fielded by Sony. The rivals are both maneuvering to adapt to video game play being hosted as a service in the internet cloud.
Blevins last year told sports multimedia group ESPN his gaming netted him a monthly revenue in seven figures and boasted legions of Twitch followers.
The video of his pretend press briefing had logged more than 5.4 million views by Thursday evening in California.
Online battle royale game ""Fortnite"" is a global sensation, with entertaining play and commentary a hit with online viewers.
Studios making games for consoles or personal computers see value in building communities of loyal players who continually engage with titles, instead of finishing them and putting them down.
""If you want to maintain a base of subscribers, engagement is key,"" Hugues Ouvrard, head of Xbox in France, told AFP at a video game trade show earlier this year.
Microsoft has revealed plans for a next-generation console, but said that cloud gaming is a core of its strategy.
Contenders in the game-streaming arena will need content, cloud capacity and a community of players.
Google plans to launch its video game streaming service Stadia in 14 countries starting in November.
The new gaming platform aims for a Netflix-style subscription that enables players to access games on any device, powered by the internet cloud.
This could disrupt the huge gaming industry by allowing users to avoid consoles and game software on disc or download.
Microsoft is building on its Xbox success with an xCloud service. Eyes are on Amazon to see whether it will leverage its leading AWS cloud business and popular Twitch gaming community to host titles online itself. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-02-19/news_big_images/503377_80795642.jpg,Technology,The rivals are both maneuvering to adapt to video game play being hosted as a service in the internet cloud.,negative
Facebook says it dismantles covert influence campaign tied to Saudi government,"
LONDON (Reuters) - People connected to the government of Saudi Arabia have run a network of fake accounts and pages on Facebook Inc (FB.O) to promote state propaganda and attack regional rivals, the social media giant said on Thursday.
Facebook said it had suspended more than 350 accounts and pages with about 1.4 million followers, the latest takedown in an ongoing effort to combat “coordinated inauthentic behavior” on its platform, and the first such activity it has linked to the Saudi government.
“The government of Saudi Arabia has no knowledge of the mentioned accounts and does not know on what basis they were linked to it,” the Center for International Communication, the government’s media office, said in a statement sent to Reuters.
Countries in the Middle East have increasingly turned to websites such as Facebook, Twitter (TWTR.N) and Google’s (GOOGL.O) YouTube to peddle covert political influence online.
Reuters detailed an expansive Iranian-backed campaign last year and Riyadh has been accused of using the same tactics to attack regional rival Qatar and spread disinformation following the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Saudi Arabia has repeatedly denied any involvement in Khashoggi’s death. Along with allies, it maintains a trade and diplomatic boycott of Qatar, accusing it of terrorism which Qatar denies.
Facebook announces takedowns of “inauthentic behavior” as often as multiple times a month, but statements that directly link such behavior to a government are rare.
“For this operation, our investigators were able to confirm that the individuals behind this are associated with the government of Saudi Arabia,” said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy.
“Anytime we have a link between an information operation and a government, that’s significant and people should be aware.”
Facebook also said on Thursday it had suspended a separate network of more than 350 accounts linked to marketing firms in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. In that case it did not directly link the activity to a government.
“WOUNDED SOLDIER”
Gleicher said the Saudi campaign operated on Facebook and its Instagram photo-sharing platform, primarily targeting countries in the Middle East and North Africa, including Qatar, the UAE, Egypt Palestine.
The operation used fake accounts posing as those countries’ citizens and pages designed to look like local news outlets. More than $100,000 was spent on advertisements, Facebook said.
“They would typically post in Arabic about regional news and political issues. They would talk about things like Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - his internal and economic social reform plan, the successes of the Saudi armed forces, particularly during the conflict in Yemen,” said Gleicher.
Andy Carvin, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensics Lab, which worked with Facebook to analyze the Saudi campaign, said some of the accounts dated back to early 2014 but the majority had been created in the last two years.
More than 90% of the content was in Arabic, Carvin said, with some of the accounts “essentially operating as fan pages for the Saudi government and military.”
A copy of one of the Saudi posts released by Facebook on Thursday showed the crown prince kissing the bandaged head of a patient in a hospital bed. The Arabic caption reads: “His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman kisses the head of a wounded soldier.”
ONLINE BATTLEGROUND
Social media companies are under mounting pressure to help stop illicit political influence online.
U.S. intelligence officials have said that Russia used Facebook and other platforms to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and are concerned it will do so again in 2020. Moscow denies such allegations.
The Atlantic Council’s Ben Nimmo said online information operations were becoming increasingly visible as more governments and political groups adopt the tactics and the social media companies step up efforts to take them down.
Facebook has made at least 14 public announcements about takedowns of “inauthentic behavior” stemming from 17 different countries this year. The most recent announcement before Thursday included accounts run by people in Thailand, Russia, Ukraine and Honduras.
The network based in the UAE and Egypt that was also dismantled on Thursday was separate from the Saudi campaign, Facebook said, although it targeted some of the same countries in the Middle East and Africa with messages promoting the UAE.
“This shows how much social media has become a battleground, particularly in the Gulf, where you’ve got very strong regional rivalries and you’ve got a long tradition of working through proxies,” Nimmo said.
“This is almost becoming normalized,” he added. “Where you get geopolitical tensions, you get stuff like this going on, and we’re moving into a space where the platforms are dealing with this almost as routine.”  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-02-19/news_big_images/503356_98082879.jpg,Technology,"“Anytime we have a link between an information operation and a government, that’s significant and people should be aware.”

"Food waste, the hidden climate change driver","
PARIS (AFP) - As experts gather in Geneva to finalise the most detailed scientific assessment yet of how we use the land we live off, one phenomenon to which we all contribute will be under close scrutiny: food waste.
Ahead of the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on land use, here are some facts about food waste:

One third of all food 


An IPCC draft summary says between 25-30 percent of food produced for human consumption every year -- approximately 1.3 billion tonnes -- gets lost or wasted. That’s a 40 percent increase since 1970, or an additional 200 calories per person per day.
According to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), food loss and waste costs the global economy close to $1 trillion each year.
It also generates as much as eight percent of all manmade greenhouse gas emissions, the FAO says.

Inequality 

But not all food waste is equal. The IPCC report is expected to highlight vast disparities between food production and rejection in rich and developing nations.
The FAO says that consumers in rich nations bin almost as much food annually (222 million tonnes) as the entire net food production of sub-Saharan Africa (230 million tonnes).
A draft of the IPCC report says that people in Europe and North America each throw away an average of 95-115 kilogrammes (209-254 pounds) of food each year; people in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia throw away just 6-11 kg.

Food ‘loss’ vs ‘waste’ 


As well as wildly varying levels, the causes of food waste and loss change according to development.
Whereas in developing countries 40 percent of losses occur post-harvest, in industrialised nations 40 percent of losses happen at retail and consumer levels.
""In the global south it’s a lot to do with a lack of preservation, lack of transport systems, food being produced in the villages and not being able to make it to market,"" said Teresa Anderson, climate policy coordinator at ActionAid.
""Whereas in the north much more is wasted after it gets to the supermarkets. Supermarkets themselves throw vegetables away because they are not pretty enough, or because of their size or shape.""

Obesity = waste? 


Around two billion people across the world are overnourished or obese, while 820 million people go to bed hungry each night.
The IPCC draft section on food waste says ""consumption above nutritional needs can be seen as a form of food waste"", which is ""at least as large a contributor to food system losses"" as throwing food away.  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-02-19/news_big_images/503339_51749259.jpg,Technology,"The IPCC draft section on food waste says ""consumption above nutritional needs can be seen as a form of food waste"", which is ""at least as large a contributor to food system losses"" as throwing food away.",negative
