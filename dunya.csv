"FAO launches two reports on Pakistan, Asia-Pacific region's forestry outlook","
ISLAMABAD (APP) – United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Thursday launched two reports on forestry outlook of Pakistan and Asia-Pacific region, suggesting appropriate attention of all stakeholders to overcome decreasing green cover caused by climate change. 
The reports underlined the need for engaging youth for massive afforestation and ecological conservations especially in mountainous regions.
Adviser to Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam formally launched the World Bank funded reports, titled ""Forest Futures-Sustainable pathways for forests, landscapes and people in the Asia-Pacific region"" and ""Forestry Sector Review Pakistan- 2019"" here at a ceremony.
Addressing participants of the launching ceremony, he said the FAO report about Pakistan had reflected that Pakistan s initiatives witnessed five percent increase in overall forest cover of the country, while six percent in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
He said the recommendations and way forward contained in these reports had already been incorporated in the plans prepared for 10 Billion Tree Tsunami (10BTT).
""The government is very firm and believes in the way forward to plant as many trees as it can across the country. We have an opportunity in the form of 45 per cent rangeland lying vacant to develop forests. However, all seven plans are ready for 10BTT plantation taking all provinces on board,"" he informed.
Unfortunately, he said, there had been conflicting number of existing forests in past, but these reports would help provide  strong statistics  in that regard.
Amin said ""We are going to energize our youth for its active participation in the 10BTT so that a sense of ownership could be developed among public for the mega plantation.
""The adviser said there was a strong political commitment as Prime Minister Imran Khan and the federal cabinet had approved funding for 10BTT despite harsh economic conditions. ""We have sufficient funding for this year whereas and we will also capitalize global and donor funding available in this regard,"" he added.
""The successful Billion Tree Tsunami project in KP has managed to get global acclaim and nomination as champion project to be presented in the United Nations Secretary General Summit in September. We are also going to develop Ecosystem Restoration Fund with partners online,"" Amin Aslam said.
FAO Representative Mina Dowlatchahi said the organization was looking back in depth to study forests of Pakistan and exact knowledge of the position of forestry in the Asia-Pacific region.
She said there was a big risk in term of biodiversity loss, watershed management and other ecological issues owing to decreasing forest cover in the region.
""Planted forests in mountains are not compatible in balancing the loss of natural forests. However, during 1990-2015 the forest degradation took place rapidly. Pakistan has low forest per person capita of 0.01 hectares (ha) against 0.54 ha per person globally,"" she added.
She termed the continuous decline in biodiversity and resilience in natural forests in the Asia-Pacific region  disturbing,"" stressing the need for its reversal.
""About 300 forestry students - all youngsters from more than 30 countries - had been interviewed who claimed that they can lead healthy steps for sustainable forests for which serious steps should be taken by all stakeholders,"" Dowlatchahi said.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-01-19/news_big_images/503288_33938415.jpg,pakistan,"

Saudi Arabia allows women to travel without male 'guardian' approval,"
RIYADH (AFP) - Saudi Arabia will allow women to travel abroad without approval from a male ""guardian"", the government said Thursday, ending a restriction that drew international censure and prompted extreme attempts to flee the kingdom.
The landmark reform erodes the longstanding guardianship system that renders adult women as legal minors and allows their ""guardians"" -- husband, father and other male relatives -- to exercise arbitrary authority over them.
The decision, following years of campaigning by activists, comes after high-profile attempts by women to escape their guardians despite a string of reforms including a historic decree last year that overturned the world s only ban on female motorists.
""A passport will be granted to any Saudi national who submits an application,"" said a government ruling published in the official gazette Umm al-Qura.
The regulation effectively allows women over the age of 21 to obtain passports and leave the country without their guardian s permission, the pro-government Okaz newspaper and other local media reported, citing senior authorities.
Women in the kingdom have long required permission from their male ""guardians"" to marry, renew their passports or exit the country.
The reform grants women greater autonomy and mobility, the pro-government Saudi Gazette newspaper said, hailing the decision as ""one giant leap for Saudi women"".
The decision was met with jubilation on social media, with the hashtag ""No guardianship over women travel"" gaining traction and many posting humorous memes of women fleeing with suitcases and being chased by men.
""Some women s dreams were aborted due to inability to leave the country for whatever reason... to study abroad, a work opportunity, or even flee if so desired,"" Saudi businesswoman Muna AbuSulayman said on Twitter.
""This change means women are in a way in full control of their legal destiny.""
The changes announced Thursday also grant Saudi women what has long been a male entitlement -- the right to officially register childbirth, marriage or divorce and to be recognised as a guardian to children who are minors.
The reform comes as Saudi Arabia faces heightened international scrutiny over its human rights record, including an ongoing trial of women activists who have long demanded that the guardianship system be dismantled.
That includes Loujain al-Hathloul, a prominent rights activist who marked her 30th birthday this week in a Saudi prison, campaigners said.
Alongside a sweeping crackdown on dissent, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- the kingdom s de facto ruler -- spearheads a wide-ranging liberalisation drive that is aimed at transforming the conservative petro-state, long criticised for its treatment of women.
His reforms include the much-celebrated decision allowing women to drive in June last year, allowing women to attend soccer games alongside men and take on jobs that once fell outside the narrow confines of traditional gender roles.
But while transforming the lives of many women, critics said the reforms will be cosmetic for many others until the kingdom abolishes the ""guardianship"" system.
Some have undertaken perilous attempts to escape overseas despite the reforms.
They include 18-year-old Rahaf al-Qunun, whose live-tweeted asylum plea from a Bangkok hotel in January after she fled her Saudi family drew global attention.
Later, two Saudi sisters who sought sanctuary in Hong Kong from what they called family abuse were allowed passage to a third country that was not named for their safety.
And subsequently, two other Saudi sisters fled to Georgia.
The latest reform, which weakens but does not completely dismantle the guardianship system, could lead to family clashes in the deeply patriarchal society, observers warn.
Saudi officials have expressed committment to fighting guardianship abuse, but have warned the system can only be dismantled piecemeal to prevent a backlash from arch-conservatives.
In a one-off case last year, a Saudi court ruled in favour of a 24-year-old woman who challenged her father s decision to not let her have a passport. But until Thursday s ruling, she would have still required his permission to travel.

Troubled UN agency for Palestinians names new deputy head,"
JERUSALEM (AFP) - The UN agency for Palestinian refugees on Thursday announced the appointment of an acting deputy chief, after a report on alleged ethical abuses by top management prompted donors to freeze funds.
""Christian Saunders has been appointed as acting Deputy Commissioner-General (DCG), pending the recruitment of a full replacement to the outgoing DCG Sandra Mitchell,"" the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) said in a statement.
The internal ethics probe accused Mitchell of manipulating the system to find a well-paid job for her husband at the agency last year as it suffered through a funding crisis.
Her management style is alleged to have included bullying, cutting those she disliked out of decision-making and avoiding checks and balances, it says.
She quit last week citing ""personal reasons"".
Thursday s UNRWA statement made no mention of the internal report, seen by AFP,  which describes ""credible and corroborated"" allegations of serious ethical abuses, including some involving UNRWA s top official, Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl.
The confidential survey says the allegations include senior management engaging in ""sexual misconduct, nepotism, retaliation, discrimination and other abuses of authority, for personal gain, to suppress legitimate dissent, and to otherwise achieve their personal objectives"".
Switzerland said Tuesday it was suspending funding to the agency pending the findings of UN investigators into the allegations.
The Netherlands, one of the agency s main European donors, followed suit the following day.
UNRWA was set up in the years after more than 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their lands during the 1948 war surrounding the creation of Israel.
It provides vital schooling and medical services to millions of impoverished refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and the Palestinian territories.
In 2018, the United States suspended and later cut all funding for UNRWA, causing a financial crisis that threatened to see its schools and hospitals closed.
Its UN mandate is set to be debated later this year.
US President Donald Trump s administration, along with Israel, accuses UNRWA of perpetuating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The agency disputes that and says the services it provides would otherwise not be available to Palestinians.

US poised to formally abandon INF missile treaty,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States will officially withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty on Friday, clearing the way for a new arms race with Russia -- and throwing China into the mix.
The treaty -- concluded in 1987 by then US president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev -- limited the Cold War powers  medium-range missiles, both conventional and nuclear.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called the demise of the treaty a dangerous step that ""will likely heighten, not reduce, the threat posed by ballistic missiles.""
""When it expires tomorrow, the world will lose an invaluable brake on nuclear war,"" he said on Thursday.
US President Donald Trump s administration says the treaty is effectively dead already because of Russian violations -- a charge Russia denies. The White House launched the six-month procedure for leaving the treaty on February 1.
""I think the INF Treaty has served us well, but it only works if both parties comply,"" new US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said recently.
""The United States will remain in compliance with all of our obligations until August 2nd -- and after that point in time, we will continue to pursue what is in our best interest,"" he told lawmakers.
In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed off on Moscow s participation in the INF on July 3.
Under the deal, missiles with ranges of 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310-3,420 miles) were eliminated.
That paved the way for the mothballing of Russian SS-20 missiles and American Pershing missiles deployed in Europe.
Even if European nations have expressed concerns about the consequence of a new arms race, NATO has endorsed the US position, saying Russia s 9M729 missile had violated the INF agreement.
Moscow insists the new projectile has a maximum range of 480 kilometers -- within INF parameters.
But the death of the INF treaty may suit Washington, former defense secretary Ash Carter said in early July.
""From the military point of view, not the political point of view, it s not so bad,"" Carter said at a conference at the Council on Foreign Relations.
""We can make good use of what we call conventional prompt strike.""
On Thursday, Trump told reporters that the INF did not even come up when he talked by telephone with Putin about Russian wildfires on Wednesday.
However, he did suggest vaguely that a new treaty may be in the mix.
""Russia would like to do something on a nuclear treaty and that s ok with me. They d like to do something and so would I,"" he said.
The Pentagon is thrilled that it will now be able to modernize its arsenal to counter the mounting might of China, which is looking to assert its military supremacy in Asia.
""Most of China s inventory is of intermediate range missiles and so we need to make sure we have the capability as well to respond should we -- God forbid -- get in a fight with them one day,"" Esper said.
The United States has pledged not to deploy new nuclear-armed missiles in Europe. But it has made no such promise on the deployment of conventional weapons.
Advances in technology have allowed for the development of mid-range missiles that are much more precise than those made 30 years ago, explained career diplomat William Courtney, who is now a senior fellow at the nonprofit, nonpartisan Rand Corporation.
""The technology has changed so much that is makes it militarily attractive,"" said Courtney, an arms control expert.
For Thomas Mahnken, a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University s School of Advanced International Studies, the United States must now deploy medium-range conventional weapons on its islands in the Pacific and other territory controlled by its allies.
Such a move would help counter China s rise, especially in the South China Sea, where the People s Liberation Army has effectively commandeered several disputed islands.
""It is time to turn the tables,"" Mahnken said in a commentary published on the specialist website War on the Rocks.
""Such weapons, capable of denying China the use of littoral waters, would be a powerful deterrent to Chinese aggression.""
Such a move seems to have the support of the next chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley.
When asked by US senators about the imminent demise of the INF Treaty, he said he supported the deployment of conventional ground-based medium-range missiles in the Indo-Pacific region.
""Do you think those would be helpful?"" one senator asked.
""I do,"" Milley replied.

Dutch ban on burqas in public places takes effect,"
(AFP) – The Netherlands banned the wearing of a face-covering veil, such as a burqa or niqab, in public buildings and on transport from Thursday as a contentious law on the garment worn by some Muslim women came into force.
Between 200 and 400 women are estimated to wear a burqa or niqab in the country of 17 million people. The Dutch legislation was passed in June 2018 after more than a decade of political debate on the subject.
Far-right politician Geert Wilders had proposed the face-covering veil ban back in 2005. ""I believe we should now try to take it to the next step,"" Wilders wrote in a tweet on Thursday, urging that the simple headscarf should be banned as well.
The Dutch interior ministry issued a statement saying: ""From now on the wearing of clothing which covers the face is banned in educational facilities, public institutions and buildings, as well as hospitals and public transport.""
People must be recognisable in public spaces, so the ban also applies to face-covering helmets or hoods, punishable by a fine of 150 euros ($165).
The Dutch law does not ban the wearing of a burqa on the street, unlike France s ban which took effect in 2010. Belgium, Denmark and Austria have similar laws.

 Cannot be enforced  

The move appeared to be unpopular with the general public in The Hague. ""Ridiculous. I find it ridiculous. You should respect each other s values and I think it s the dumbest rule they ever thought of,"" Anne Spillner, 28, told AFP.
Jan Jans, 57, agreed. ""I think it s a bad law... because it cannot be enforced. It s a mix-up between combatting terrorism and Islam and religion,"" he said.
Hasnaa, 21, who declined to give her surname, said people ""should have this freedom to wear whatever we want, to express ourselves just through the way that we look.""
But Saskia, 67, who similarly declined to provide her surname, said she was in favour of the ban ""because you cannot see who is behind it (the burqa). If somebody covers themselves from head to toe and covers their face, then it is a threat.""

Not a priority 

For the ban to be enforced, the interior ministry said it was instructing school, hospital and transport staff to refuse entry to women wearing a veil. And if the woman refuses to comply, then ""they can call the police.""
But the police, who frequently call for more resources from the government, said they did not regard enforcing the ban as ""an absolute priority"".
The public transport authorities said bus, tram and metro drivers would not stop to ask a burqa-clad woman to leave or wait for police to arrive, as that would lead to delays.
""Drivers can very well decide not to say anything,"" said the head of the OVNL public transport association, Pedro Peters. Hospitals also said they would still treat people regardless of what they are wearing.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-01-19/news_big_images/503284_11512006.jpg,world,"But Saskia, 67, who similarly declined to provide her surname, said she was in favour of the ban ""because you cannot see who is behind it (the burqa).",neutral

"Rebels, jihadists kill 49 people in Yemen's Aden","
(AFP) – Separate attacks by Shiite rebels and a jihadist suicide bomber killed at least 49 people in Yemen s government-held second city Aden Thursday, many of them newly trained police cadets.
The attacks were the first to hit the southern port city in more than a year and dealt a heavy blow to the government s reorganised security forces, which have been trained and equipped by the United Arab Emirates.
Mohammed Rabid, a senior official at the health ministry, told reporters in Aden that 49 people were killed and 48 others were wounded in the two attacks.
The first attack was a suicide car bombing carried out by jihadists on a police station, a security source said.
An AFP correspondent saw dozens of troops and police reinforcements helping the wounded outside the entrance to the police station in Aden s Sheikh Othman district.
""Ten people were killed, and we admitted 16 injured, including two in critical condition in MSF surgical hospital in Aden, following this morning explosion in Sheikh Othman police station,"" Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Twitter.
The second attack was carried out by the Iran-aligned Huthi rebels, who said they launched a drone and a ballistic missile at a training camp west of Aden.
The aerial attack hit as senior commanders were overseeing a passing out parade for newly graduated cadets at Al-Jala Camp, 20 kilometres (13 miles) from the centre of Aden.

New type of missile

The missile struck about five metres (yards) from the viewing platform and a senior commander was among the dead, an AFP photographer reported.
Between 30 and 35 people were killed or wounded, most of them new graduates of the so-called Security Belt force.
The power of the blast left a large crater in the ground. Bodies were strewn around.
The internationally-recognised Yemeni government said Thursday the ""source and purpose (of the attacks) were the same"".
""The two attacks prove the Huthi militia rebels and other terrorist groups are sharing roles and complementing each other in a war against the Yemeni people,"" the government said in a statement.
Aden is controlled by the Yemeni government and its supporters in a Saudi-led military coalition, which has been fighting the rebels since 2015.
The government established its headquarters in the city after the rebels forced it out of the capital Sanaa.
The UAE is a key partner in the coalition, which has enforced an air and sea blockade of rebel-held areas and carried out a controversial bombing campaign that has exacted a heavy civilian death toll.
In recent months, the rebels have hit back with missile and drone attacks targeting neighbouring Saudi Arabia.
A Huthi rebel spokesman told AFP that Thursday s attack was an ""intelligence operation"" in which ""a new kind of missile that we have not unveiled was used as well as a drone that provided support in a big way.""

Deadlock

On the ground, the front lines have remained largely static, with the rebels still in firm control of the capital and much of the north.
Repeated UN peace efforts, including an accord reached in Sweden in December, have failed to end the fighting.
The conflict has killed and wounded tens of thousands of people and resulted in the world s worst humanitarian crisis, according to the United Nations.
In the face of the deadlock and mounting international condemnation of the civilian toll, the UAE has drawn down its troops in recent weeks, although it has been at pains to stress that it is not preparing to withdraw.
""While we will operate differently, our military presence will remain,"" UAE minister of state for foreign affairs Anwar Gargash said in an op-ed published in The Washington Post late last month.
As well as supporting the fight against the rebels, the UAE has also trained government police and troops for the US-backed war against jihadists, who have long had a presence in the south and east of Yemen.
Sunni extremists of both Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group have claimed multiple attacks in Aden in recent years, although the violence had largely subsided over the past 12 months.
In February last year, twin suicide bombings claimed by IS hit a base of an Aden counter-terrorism unit, killing five people, including a child. Five months later, two people were killed when an attacker blew himself up in the city. In January last year, Aden was rocked by deadly clashes that saw southern separatists seize much of the city from other pro-government forces.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-01-19/news_big_images/503283_36674911.jpg,world,"

Kushner meets Egypt's Sisi for Mideast peace plan talks,"
(AFP) – US President Donald Trump s advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner met Thursday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo to discuss Washington s plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace.
Both sides discussed ""ways to consolidate peace and stability in the region in light of the instability it suffers from,"" the Egyptian presidency said in a statement.
""Kushner recounted the contacts the US delegation had made with various parties to set the negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis back on track,"" it added.
The US envoy is on a regional tour which has already taken him to Jordan and Israel to discuss the controversial peace plan, already rejected by the Palestinians.
Kushner was accompanied by Trump s Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt to Cairo, a day after separate meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jordan s King Abdullah II.
The economic aspects of Kushner s initiative were unveiled at a Bahrain meeting in June, floating the prospect of $50 billion worth of investment into a stagnant Palestinian economy.
But the ""opportunity of the century"", as Kushner dubs it, has so far failed to address key Palestinian demands such as the establishment of their own independent state.
Sisi s office stressed Egypt s committment to a ""two-state solution and the building of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital"".
Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab nations to have diplomatic relations with Israel, and both sent mid-level officials to the Bahrain meeting.
Sisi met with the Jordanian king in Cairo on Monday, when they reaffirmed that any peace deal should be based on a two-state solution.
Kushner s plan has been flatly rejected by Palestinian officials, who argue the Trump administration is biased in favour of Israel.
The US president broke with decades of international consensus by recognising the contested city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

US renews waivers for Iran civil nuclear projects,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States said Wednesday it was extending waivers for three civilian nuclear projects in Iran, despite Washington’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement.
""This is a short 90 day extension,"" said White House National Security Advisor John Bolton, a champion of the hawkish policy towards Tehran.
""We are watching those nuclear activities very, very closely, they remain under daily scrutiny,"" he told Fox Business.
The projects include the Bushehr nuclear power plant, the Arak heavy water reactor, which has been modified under the supervision of the international community to render it impossible to produce plutonium for military use, and the Fordow fuel enrichment plant.
The State Department downplayed the move, as it did when it last granted an extension in May, describing the waivers as ""continued restrictions on the Iranian regime’s nuclear program"".
""The action today will help preserve oversight of Iran’s civil nuclear program, reduce proliferation risks, constrain Iran’s ability to shorten its ‘breakout time’ to a nuclear weapon, and prevent the regime from reconstituting sites for proliferation-sensitive purposes,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.
In reality, the move extends exemptions for the three Iranian civil nuclear projects, the State Department confirmed to AFP.
There was debate in President Donald Trump’s administration about these exemptions, with hawks saying that after Washington’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, it would have been logical to stop them in order to further increase the pressure on Tehran.
But the more moderate line has prevailed for the moment, so as not to upset the other signatories to the 2015 deal -- China, Russia, Germany, France and Britain -- amid escalating tensions between the US and Iran.
The 2015 agreement promised that world powers would assist Iran in developing civilian nuclear energy -- the clerical regime’s stated goal for its atomic program.

Afghan troop numbers drop sharply in crackdown on 'ghost' soldiers,"
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - There has been a sharp drop in the size of Afghanistan’s National Defense Security Forces in the past few months due to changes in the way troops are counted and an effort to reduce the number of so-called “ghost” soldiers, a U.S. government watchdog said on Thursday.

The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) said in a report that ANDSF personnel size had gone down by nearly 10 percentage points in the most recent quarter compared to the previous trimester.

The number of ANDSF troops fell by nearly 42,000 compared to roughly the same period, between April and the end of June last year, the report said.

The disclosure comes as Washington attempts to clinch a framework peace agreement with Taliban insurgents that is expected to include a timeline for withdrawing U.S. troops, which now number about 14,000 in Afghanistan.

Some 9,000 of those forces are involved with training, advising and assisting Afghan security forces. U.S. officials have long expressed concerns about the strength and capability of the Afghan forces, especially without adequate international support.

SIGAR, citing information from the U.S.-led coalition, said the decline in Afghan force levels owed to a move by the ANDSF to switch their reporting of personnel strength to the number of biometrically validated forces, rather than just the number reported on-hand by officials in the field.

“The change was part of an effort by the United States and its partners to reduce opportunities for corrupt ANDSF officials to report ‘ghost’ (nonexistent) soldiers and police on personnel rolls in order to pocket the salaries,” the report said.

With a potential U.S. drawdown looming, recent Taliban attacks in Afghanistan have underscored pressure on Afghanistan’s overstretched security forces. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-01-19/news_big_images/503158_46327902.jpg,world,"

"Trump, Putin discuss Russian wildfires: White House","
WASHINGTON (AFP) - US President Donald Trump spoke on Wednesday with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin about wildfires in Siberia and trade, the White House said.
Trump ""expressed concern over the vast wildfires afflicting Siberia. The leaders also discussed trade between the two countries,"" according to a brief statement from Trump’s press office.
Earlier, the Russian state-run news agency Ria reported that Washington initiated the call to the Kremlin, and that Trump offered US help with the fires.

According to the Ria report, Putin praised the offer of help as a good sign for improvement in US-Russian relations.

US sanctions Iran's foreign minister,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions against Iran s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, effectively slamming the door on the country s top diplomat.
The sanctions freeze any of Zarif s assets in the United States or that are controlled by US entities, the government announced, saying it also will curtail his international travel.
""Zarif implements the reckless agenda of Iran s Supreme Leader, and is the regime s primary spokesperson around the world. The United States is sending a clear message to the Iranian regime that its recent behavior is completely unacceptable,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
The designation of Zarif under the same sanctions earlier applied to Iran s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is the latest blow by President Donald Trump to the Obama administration s attempt to end nuclear tensions through negotiations.
Zarif has been at the heart of complex talks with foreign capitals over Iran s nuclear power industry, which Tehran says is peaceful, but Washington and regional allies including Israel insist is cover for a secret weapons program.
But a senior Trump administration official said that Zarif s diplomatic image -- bolstered by his fluent English, self-effacing humor and background as a US-educated academic -- was false.
""The key issue is that he has had this veneer... of being the sincere and reasonable interlocutor for the regime. Our point today is that he is no such thing,"" the official said on condition of anonymity.
""Today President Trump decided enough was enough,"" the official said, accusing Zarif of functioning as ""propaganda minister, not foreign minister.""
Zarif shot back, tweeting that Washington is trying to silence Iran on the international stage.
""The US  reason for designating me is that I am Iran s  primary spokesperson around the world  Is the truth really that painful?"" he tweeted.
In addition to attempting to freeze assets, Washington will also squeeze Zarif s ability to function as a globe-trotting diplomat. He is expected to be able to continue to visit the United Nations in New York, albeit under tight restrictions.
""The United States will continue to uphold our obligations,"" the administration official said.
In mid-July, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Zarif would be issued a visa but would be limited to the area reaching six blocks around the UN headquarters.
Trump last year left a denuclearization accord negotiated by Zarif with six nations including the United States under former president Barack Obama and imposed crippling sanctions on Tehran s economy, also vowing to curb Tehran s regional influence.
With tensions escalating in June, Trump says he issued a last-minute cancelation of military strikes on Iran after it shot down a US drone.
Critics question the legal or diplomatic rationale for targeting Zarif, however, saying that sanctions will all but end the possibility of dialogue.

Germany nixes US request to join naval mission off Iran,"
BERLIN (AFP) - Germany poured cold water Wednesday on a US demand it join a maritime surveillance mission in the Strait of Hormuz, arguing that it wants to focus on diplomacy to ease tensions with Iran.
Chancellor Angela Merkel s government was responding to a US demand made public a day earlier ""to help secure"" the world s busiest oil shipping lane and ""combat Iranian aggression"".
Merkel s spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer said Germany was ""reluctant"" to join such a US-led mission and had ""not offered a contribution, as the overall approach of our policy toward Iran differs significantly from the current US approach"".
Berlin was seeking an emphasis on ""diplomacy and de-escalation"", she said, as it also tries to save the Iran nuclear deal from which President Donald Trump withdrew last year.
Demmer said that ""participation in a US-led mission could complicate this issue, even as of course we share the goal of freedom of navigation"".
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas was even more direct, reflecting the position of his centre-left Social Democrats, who are junior coalition partners to Merkel s conservatives.
Germany ""will not participate in the maritime mission proposed and planned by the US,"" said Maas, adding that ""we are in close coordination with our French partners"" on the issue.
Berlin ""considers the US strategy of maximum pressure on Iran to be wrong,"" he said, speaking on a Warsaw visit.
Britain last week ordered its navy to escort UK-flagged ships in the strait in response to Iranian soldiers seizing a tanker in the flashpoint entrance to the Gulf.
Demmer said that Germany remained ""in close coordination with France and Britain"" on questions of maritime security, adding that Berlin believed the idea of a European naval mission was ""worth considering"".

Al-Qaeda heir Hamza bin Laden killed: US media,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - Osama bin Laden’s son Hamza, chosen heir to the leadership of Al-Qaeda, has been killed, US media reported Wednesday citing American officials.
NBC News said three US officials had confirmed they had information of Hamza bin Laden’s death, but gave no details of the place or date.
The New York Times subsequently cited two US officials saying they had confirmation that he was killed during the last two years in an operation that involved the United States.
Questioned by reporters in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump did not confirm or deny the NBC report.
""I don’t want to comment on it,"" he said.
Both reports suggested that bin Laden may have been killed well before the US State Department announced a $1 million bounty on his head in February 2019.
The 15th of Osama bin Laden’s 20 children and a son of his third wife, Hamza, thought to be about 30 years old, was ""emerging as a leader in the Al-Qaeda franchise,"" the State Department said in announcing the reward.
Sometimes dubbed the ""crown prince of jihad, he had put out audio and video messages calling for attacks on the United States and other countries, especially to avenge his father’s killing by US forces in Pakistan in May 2011, the department said.
Documents seized in the raid on his father’s house in Abbottabad suggested Hamza was being groomed as heir to the Al-Qaeda leadership.
US forces also found a video of the wedding of Hamza to the daughter of another senior Al-Qaeda official that is believed to have taken place in Iran.
Hamza bin Laden’s whereabouts have never been pinpointed. He was believed to have been under house arrest in Iran but reports suggest he also may have resided in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria.
The group behind the deadly September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, Al-Qaeda’s prominence as a radical group has faded over the past decade in the shadow.
But the proliferation of branches and associated jihadist groups in Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria and elsewhere have underscored its continuing potency.

Groomed to lead

Hamza bin Laden was not targeted just because he was bin Laden’s son, said Rita Katz, executive director of the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks extremists.
""He was one of Al-Qaeda’s loudest voices calling for attacks in the West and giving directives. He, with Al-Qaeda’s help, was positioning himself to lead the global jihadi movement,"" Katz said on Twitter.
""He was seen as a future leader who would unite the global jihad. Thus, if he is indeed dead, it will be a major blow to the movement,"" she said.
""I think it’s a big loss for Al-Qaeda,"" said Pakistani security expert Rahimullah Yusufzai, one the few journalists to have interviewed Osama bin Laden face to face.
At his father’s side in Afghanistan before the 9/11 attacks, Hamza learnt how to handle weapons, and ranted in his thin voice against Americans, Jews and ""Crusaders"" in videos uploaded online.
In 2016 Al-Qaeda released a video message in which he urged Islamic State and other jihadists in Syria to unite, claiming that the fight in the war-torn country paves the way to ""liberating Palestine.""
""There is no longer an excuse for those who insist on division and disputes now that the whole world has mobilised against Muslims,"" he said.
In a later message that year he called on Saudi youth to overthrow the kingdom’s rulers, telling them to enlist in the Yemen-based Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to gain battlefield experience.
In 2017 he was placed on the US terrorist blacklist, seen as a potent future figurehead for the group then led by Osama bin Laden’s former deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-01-19/news_big_images/503137_62491378.jpg,world,US forces also found a video of the wedding of Hamza to the daughter of another senior Al-Qaeda official that is believed to have taken place in Iran.,neutral

UN Security Council to discuss N. Korea missile tests,"
UNITED NATIONS (AFP) - The United Nations Security Council will meet behind closed doors on Thursday to discuss North Korea s recent ballistic missiles tests, diplomats said.
Britain, France and Germany requested the discussion amid growing concern that Pyongyang is developing long-range weapons in violation of UN Security Council resolutions.
North Korea fired two ballistic missiles on Wednesday, Seoul said, days after a similar launch that the nuclear-armed North described as a warning to the South over planned joint military drills with the United States.
The North is banned from ballistic missile launches under UN Security Council resolutions but it was the second in less than a week, despite a meeting between leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump last month.
Pyongyang and Washington are engaged in a long-running diplomatic process over the North s nuclear and missile programs that has seen three high-profile encounters between their leaders in the space of a year.
They agreed to resume talks during their impromptu June encounter in the Demilitarized Zone that divides the peninsula, but that working-level dialogue has yet to begin.
""We ll be having consultations on North Korea on Thursday morning. We re going to discuss the latest missile launches that are violations of Security Council resolutions,"" a source told AFP.
A separate source said the discussions would form part of any other business, the last item on the agenda of a closed doors meeting being held to mark the first day of Poland s presidency of the Security Council.

"Boris Johnson visits N. Ireland, heart of Brexit battle","
BELFAST (AFP) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday visited Northern Ireland, the key battleground in Brexit and the focus of increasingly tense rhetoric on both sides of the Irish Sea.
He arrived in Belfast on Tuesday amid warnings from Irish leaders that his vow to leave the European Union, with or without a deal, risks breaking up the United Kingdom.
Those warnings continued on Wednesday.
But during meetings with the province s main political parties he reiterated his determination to split with the EU.
""The Prime Minister made clear that the UK would be leaving the EU on October 31st come what may,"" a Downing Street spokesperson said.
After meeting Johnson, Mary Lou McDonald, the head of Republican Sinn Fein party, said he had ""set the compass for a disorderly and a crash Brexit,"" meaning that there had now to be the opportunity for Northern Ireland to consider joining the Republic.
""We ve made it clear to him that the extensive planning that he tells us he is carrying out in respect of a crash Brexit has to include the constitutional question,"" she told the BBC.
The Republic of Ireland shares a land border with the province that both sides want to keep free-flowing after Brexit, both for economic reasons and to maintain the delicate peace deal that brought an end to decades of violence between the pro-Irish and pro-British communities.
But post-Brexit, that border will become part of the EU s external frontier and would legally require policing.
The agreement struck by Johnson s predecessor Theresa May proposed the so-called ""backstop"" solution after Brexit.
But eurosceptics believe it gives the EU too much control over the UK and risks constitutionally distancing Northern Ireland from Britain.
If a trade deal cannot be agreed by the end of 2020, under the backstop the UK would remain aligned with the EU customs union, while Northern Ireland would additionally stay aligned to some European single market rules, in order to keep the Irish border free-flowing.
Neither London nor Brussels can end the arrangement unilaterally.
On Tuesday, Johnson told Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar that the ""backstop"" plan was unacceptable, putting him at odds with both Dublin and Brussels, which insist the deal is not open for renegotiation.
""If they really can t do it then clearly we have to get ready for a no-deal exit,"" Johnson said on a trip to Wales, adding: ""It s up to the EU: this is their call.""
Varadkar has said previously that Johnson s plan to renegotiate the deal by October 31 was ""totally not in the real world"".
Leaving without a deal would throw the border status into confusion and threaten economic catastrophe for Ireland, cutting it off from its UK main trading partner.
Varadkar said on Friday that a no-deal Brexit would make the unification of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland more likely.
""People who you might describe as moderate nationalists or moderate Catholics who were more or less happy with the status quo will look more towards a united Ireland,"" he said.
Northern Ireland is not the only part of the United Kingdom whose status after Brexit is under the spotlight.
Johnson visited Scotland on Monday, where First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said last week that Scotland needed an ""alternative option"" to his Brexit strategy.
In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford told him that Brexit would be ""catastrophic"" and to ""stop playing fast and loose with our country"".

"North Korea launches 2 short-range missiles, Seoul says","
SEOUL (AP) — South Korea s military said North Korea conducted its second weapons test in less than a week Wednesday, firing two short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast in a move observers said could be aimed at boosting pressure on the United States as the rivals struggle to set up fresh nuclear talks.
South Korea s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the missiles were launched from Wonsan, a city the North pushes as a vacation destination but that it also uses as a regular launch site.
It said both missiles were believed to have flown about 250 kilometers (155 miles) at a maximum altitude of 30 kilometers (19 miles), and that the South Korean and U.S. militaries were trying to gather more details.
The test, which would be yet another North Korean violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, comes as the country s negotiations with the U.S. over its nuclear weapons program are at a stalemate and as Pyongyang has expressed anger over planned U.S.-South Korean military drills.
""The North s repeated missile launches are not helpful to efforts to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula, and we urge (North Korea) to stop this kind of behavior,"" the South Korean statement said.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters that the launches were ""no threat to Japanese national security.""
Last Thursday, North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles that Seoul officials said flew 600 kilometers (370 miles) and as high as 50 kilometers (30 miles) before landing in the sea.
North Korea s state media said those tests were supervised by leader Kim Jong Un and were designed to deliver a ""solemn warning"" to South Korea over its purchase of high-tech U.S.-made fighter jets and the planned military drills, which Pyongyang calls an invasion rehearsal.
Even though North Korea is banned by the U.N. from using ballistic technology in any weapons launches, it s unlikely that the nation, already under 11 rounds of U.N. sanctions, will be hit with more punitive measures. Past sanctions were imposed only when the North conducted long-range ballistic launches.
Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya told reporters Wednesday that the most recently launched weapons did not reach Japan s exclusive economic zone and that officials were still analyzing details, including the flight distance and trajectory.
""It is extremely regrettable that North Korea continues firing the missiles that violate the U.N. resolutions,"" Iwaya said.
Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman from the Chinese foreign ministry, said that China noted the launches and the responses of all sides, and that the ""political settlement on the (Korean) Peninsula is currently in a critical stage."" China is North Korea s most important economic and diplomatic ally.
""We hope that all parties concerned will cherish the hard-won alleviations and jointly make positive efforts to promote denuclearization and realize lasting peace on the peninsula and in the region,"" Hua told reporters at a daily news briefing.
Observers say a low altitude flight by the missiles indicate North Korea may have been testing their ability to avoid being intercepted.
Earlier last week, Kim visited a newly built submarine and expressed his satisfaction with its weapons system. North Korea said its deployment was ""near at hand.""
In a private briefing to lawmakers Wednesday, South Korean military intelligence officers said they ve determined that the submarine likely has three launch tubes for missiles, according to Lee Hye-hoon, head of parliament s intelligence committee. If confirmed, it would be North Korea s first operational submarine with missile launch tubes, some experts said.
North Korea acquiring the ability to launch missiles from submarines would be an alarming development because such missiles are harder to detect in advance. Experts say the submarine North Korea used to test-fire missiles in recent years should be regarded as a test platform with a single launch tube. They say other North Korean submarines only have torpedo launch tubes.
Wednesday s launches came hours after a senior U.S. official said President Donald Trump sent Kim mementos from his brief visit to an inter-Korean border town late last month.
The official said a top staffer from the National Security Council hand-delivered photographs from the leaders  June meeting at the Korean Demilitarized Zone to a North Korean official last week. The Trump administration official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official wasn t authorized to speak publicly.
The DMZ meeting was the third summit between Trump and Kim. At their second meeting, in Vietnam in February, Trump rejected Kim s demand for widespread sanctions relief in return for dismantling the North s main nuclear complex, a partial disarmament step.
During the DMZ meeting, Trump and Kim agreed to resume nuclear diplomacy in coming weeks, but there hasn t been any known meeting between the countries.
Speaking to reporters accompanying him to an Asian security forum in Thailand, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he s ""very hopeful"" for a quick resumption in the nuclear talks.
Despite a recent lack of progress in nuclear diplomacy, both Trump and Kim have said they have maintained good relations with each other. After last Thursday s missile launches, Trump tried to downplay the significance of the tests, saying that ""short-range"" was the most important detail. He said North Korea fired ""standard"" missiles that many countries possess.
South Korea s military said the flight data of the weapon launched last week showed similarities to the Russian-made Iskander, a short-range, nuclear-capable missile. A North Korean version could likely reach all of South Korea — and the 28,500 U.S. forces stationed there — and would be extremely hard to intercept.
Before last week s launches, North Korea last fired missiles into the sea in early May, and experts said those were also Iskander-like missiles. During Wednesday s briefing, the South Korean military intelligence officers said that an analysis of North Korea-dispatched photos showed that the North fired four missiles on two days, according to Lee, the lawmaker. South Korea earlier said the North fired a total of three missiles at the time.
After entering talks with Washington, North Korea has suspended nuclear and long-range missile tests, and Trump has said that is proof that his North Korea policy is working well and has eased the danger of a war with the North.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-31-19/news_big_images/503067_81771045.jpg,world,"

Bangladesh grapples with country's worst dengue outbreak,"
DHAKA (AP) — Bangladesh is facing its worst-ever dengue fever outbreak as hospitals are flooded with patients, putting a severe strain on the country s already overwhelmed medical system.
The mosquito-borne viral infection has spread across the country, with 61 out of 64 districts reporting dengue cases by late Tuesday.
The government has confirmed 15,369 dengue cases since Jan. 1. Of those, 9,683 patients were diagnosed between July 1 and July 30. As of Tuesday, about 4,400 patients, including many children, were undergoing hospital treatment. There have been 14 deaths.
Officials from Dhaka, the overcrowded capital and the epicenter of the outbreak, have struggled to contain it, drawing criticism and spreading panic among some residents.
Dengue is found in tropical areas around the world and is spread by a type of mosquito that mainly lives in urban areas. The virus causes severe flu-like symptoms, and while there is no specific treatment for the illness, medical care to maintain a person s fluid levels is seen as critical.
There are fears that the situation in the countryside will worsen as many residents of the city travel to villages to celebrate Eid-ul-Adha next month. Infected humans can serve as a source of the virus for uninfected mosquitoes.
Ayesha Akhter, assistant director at the Directorate General of Health Services under the Ministry of Health, said an outbreak of dengue has accompanied every monsoon since 2000, but this year s situation is the worst.
A DGHS study identified a six-fold increase in the Aedes aegypti mosquito population in four months in Dhaka as the primary cause of the larger-than-average outbreak.
Earlier this month, the World Health Organization said the dengue situation in Bangladesh was ""alarming but not out of control.""
Other countries in Asia are also facing a surge in dengue cases this year, including Thailand, where 53,699 cases and 65 deaths were reported as of July 23.
Nevertheless, with dengue cases soaring in recent weeks, Dhaka hospitals have been running out of room and manpower to treat new patients.
Prof. Abul Kalam Azad, director general of DGHS, said they had asked the hospitals to increase beds for dengue patients and to open dengue wards. The government also halved the charges for diagnosing dengue and directed public and private hospitals, clinics and diagnostic centers to do the same.
Dhaka Medical College Hospital, the largest hospital in the country, opened a special ward for dengue patients, said A.K.M. Nasir Uddin, its director general.
Prof. Uttam Kumar Barua, director of Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, another major public hospital in Dhaka, said they were relying on senior medical students to assist doctors in the face of so many patients.
""We don t have manpower, logistic support and technicians as much as needed. That s why we are having too much pressure. We have three times more patients than our bed capacity,"" Barua said.
He said they were admitting every dengue patient who entered the hospital but could not provide beds or even seats for everyone, adding that many had been asked to wait in hospital corridors and verandas.
Champa Begum took her 8-month-old to Shaheed hospital on Wednesday.
""I have other kids. I go to work leaving this one to another child. I have no way but to work,"" she said. ""I can t take care of this child properly. This child is laid down anywhere. My home is above dirty water. That how this one was bitten and got dengue.""
On Tuesday, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called for concerted efforts to fight the illness.
""The government is working to tackle dengue,"" she told an emergency meeting of her ruling Awami League party via teleconference from London, where she was on an official visit.
""I urge everyone to keep their houses and surrounding areas clean. That will save us from the disease,"" she said.
The country s opposition parties and urban planning experts blamed the central and local government s lack of preparedness for the rise in dengue cases. People have taken to Facebook to vent their anger about city authorities  failure to control dengue-carrying mosquitoes.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-31-19/news_big_images/503065_38560618.jpg,world,"Nevertheless, with dengue cases soaring in recent weeks, Dhaka hospitals have been running out of room and manpower to treat new patients.",neutral

"Trump hits China with more tariffs, sharply escalating trade dispute","
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1, sharply escalating a bruising trade war between the world’s largest economies and jolting financial markets.
The announcement on Thursday extends Trump’s trade tariffs to nearly all of the Chinese goods the United States imports and marks an abrupt end to a temporary truce in a trade row that has hurt world growth and disrupted global supply chains.
Trump also threatened to raise tariffs further if China’s President Xi Jinping fails to move more quickly to strike a trade deal.
“I think President Xi ... wants to make a deal, but frankly, he’s not going fast enough,” Trump said.
Trump made the announcement in a series of Twitter posts after his top trade negotiators briefed him on a lack of progress in U.S.-China talks in Shanghai this week.
Trump later said if trade negotiations fail to progress he could raise tariffs further - even beyond the 25 percent levy he has already imposed on $250 billion of imports from China.
Senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi told reporters on the sidelines of an Association of Southeast Nations event in Thailand the additional tariffs were “not a correct way” to deal with the bilateral dispute.
“Additional tariffs is definitely not a constructive way to resolve economic and trade frictions,” he said.
The news hit U.S. financial markets hard. On Friday, Asian stocks took a battering and the safe-haven yen jumped as investors rushed for cover.
Oil prices plummeted 7%, with Brent crude registering the biggest daily percentage drop since February 2016. The benchmark S&P 500, which had been in solidly positive territory on Thursday afternoon, closed down 0.9%. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields also fell.
Retail associations predicted a spike in consumer prices. Target Corp tumbled 4.2%, Macy’s Inc fell 6% and Nordstrom Inc was down 6.2%.
Asked about the impact on financial markets, Trump told reporters: “I’m not concerned about that at all.”
Moody’s said the new tariffs would weigh on the global economy at a time when growth is already slowing in the United States, China and the euro zone.
The tariffs may also force the Federal Reserve to again cut interest rates to protect the U.S. economy from trade-policy risks, experts said.
Raising tariffs would lower the prospects of a deal rather than expedite it, China’s Global Times newspaper said. Beijing would focus more on efforts to survive a prolonged trade war, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Communist Party-backed newspaper, said on Twitter.
“New tariffs will by no means bring closer a deal that the U.S. wants; it will only make it further away,” Hu said.
CHINESE RETALIATION?
Possible retaliatory measures by China could include tariffs, a ban on the export of rare earths and penalties against U.S. companies in China.
So far, Beijing has refrained from slapping tariffs on U.S. crude oil and big aircraft, after cumulatively imposing additional retaliatory tariffs of up to 25% on about $110 billion of U.S. goods since the trade war broke out last year.
China is also drafting a list of “unreliable entities” - foreign firms that have harmed Chinese interests. U.S. delivery giant FedEx is under investigation by China.
“China will deliver each retaliation methodically, and deliberately, one by one,” ING economist Iris Pang wrote in a note.
“We believe China’s strategy in this trade war escalation will be to slow down the pace of negotiation and tit-for-tat retaliation. This could lengthen the process of retaliation until the upcoming U.S. presidential election,” Pang said.
FRUSTRATED
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin briefed Trump on their first face-to-face meeting with Chinese officials since Trump met Xi at the G20 summit at the end of June and agreed to a ceasefire in the trade war.
“When my people came home, they said, ‘We’re talking. We have another meeting in early September.’ I said, ‘That’s fine, but until such time as there’s a deal, we’ll be taxing them,” Trump told reporters.
A source familiar with the matter said Trump grew frustrated and composed the tweets shortly after Lighthizer and Mnuchin told him China made no significant movement on its position.
Previous negotiations collapsed in May, when U.S. officials accused China of backing away from earlier commitments.
American business groups in China expressed disquiet over the latest round of U.S. tariffs. The U.S.-China Business Council said on Friday it was concerned the action “will drive the Chinese from the negotiating table, reducing hope raised by a second round of talks that ended this week in Shanghai.”
“We are particularly concerned about increased regulatory scrutiny, delays in licenses and approvals, and discrimination against U.S. companies in government procurement tenders,” said the U.S.-China Business Council’s President Craig Allen in an e-mail.
Ker Gibbs, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, urged both sides to keep talking.
Gibbs said that as market access in China “remains unnecessarily restricted,” the United States should continue its dialogue with Beijing, and “also work with like-minded countries to persuade China that fair and reciprocal trade and investment benefits all.”
CROPS AND DRUGS
Trump said Beijing had failed to stop sales of the synthetic opioid fentanyl to the United States, as it had promised to do. He also said Beijing had not fulfilled a goodwill pledge to buy more U.S. agricultural products.
Trump has failed to make good on a goodwill gesture he said he would make after the G20 meeting to relax restrictions on sales to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei.
Trump had been pressing Xi to crack down on a flood of fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances from China, which U.S. officials say is the main source of a drug blamed for most of more than 28,000 synthetic opioid-related overdose deaths in the United States in 2017.
China had pledged that from May 1 it would expand the list of narcotics subject to state control to include the more than 1,400 known fentanyl analogues, which have a slightly different chemical makeup but are addictive and potentially deadly, as well as any new ones developed in the future.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday confirmed a small private sale to China of 68,000 tonnes of soybeans in the week ended July 25.
It was the first sale to a private buyer since Beijing offered to exempt five crushers from the 25% import tariffs imposed more than a year ago. Soybean futures opened lower on Thursday as traders shrugged off the purchase because of the small volume involved, and losses accelerated after Trump’s tweets.
RETAIL IMPACT
The new tariffs will jack up prices for consumers at the start of the back-to-school buying season, four large retail trade associations said on Thursday.
“President Trump is, in effect, using American families as a hostage in his trade war negotiations,” said Matt Priest, president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America.
Stephen Lamar, executive vice president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, said his group’s members were shocked that Trump had not allowed the resumed U.S.-China trade talks to proceed further before acting.
The measure will hit U.S. consumers far harder than Chinese manufacturers, who produce 42% of apparel and 69% of footwear purchased in the United States, Lamar said.  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-02-19/news_big_images/503355_62067159.jpg,business,"The U.S.-China Business Council said on Friday it was concerned the action “will drive the Chinese from the negotiating table, reducing hope raised by a second round of talks that ended this week in Shanghai.”

Govt increases petrol price by Rs5.15 per litre,"
ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – The government on Wednesday has increased petroleum products prices for the month of August 2019.
According to notification issued on Sunday, petrol price has been increased by Rs5.15 per litre, whereas the price of High Speed Diesel increased by Rs5.65.
The prices of kerosene oil and light diesel oil has also been increased by Rs5.38 and Rs8.90 respectively.
Earlier last month, Finance ministry had decided against increasing the prices of petroleum products. It was announced that prices would not be increased.
It is pertinent to mention here that earlier it surfaced on media that Oil consumers may face a hike of Rs2.30 per litre in the price of high-speed diesel (HSD) for July 2019. However, they may get some relief in the petrol price.
The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) recommended to the government a reduction of Rs0.77 per litre in the petrol price and a hike of Rs2.30 per litre in the HSD price for July 2019.
High-speed diesel is widely used in agriculture and transport sectors and an expected increase in its price would have direct inflationary impact on the masses. The hike in the diesel price will push up the rate of inflation.
Ogra had also proposed an increase of Rs0.26 per litre in the price of light diesel oil (LDO). This product is used in the industry. If the proposed increase in its price is approved, its rate will jump to Rs88.88 per litre against the existing Rs86.62 per litre.

In previous weeks, the local currency has depreciated massively despite receiving the first tranche of $991.4 million from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The stringent conditions – on which the global moneylender has formally approved the bailout package of $6 billion for Pakistan – seem to have exerted more pressure on the local currency.
The gradual drop in the rupee had come due to high demand for the dollar against thin supply as the country continued to make aggressive international payments to partially pay off huge foreign debt and for imports.

Besides increased demand of the greenback in the local market, they have termed ‘balance of payments deficit’ as the main reason in the recent hike in the value of the US dollar.
Moreover, they consider that state’s exports and investment are required to grow significantly, and the imports must be reduced to remove pressure on the local currency.

"U.S., China meet for trade talks as Trump talks tough","
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Top U.S. and Chinese trade officials met in Shanghai on Wednesday for talks in a bid to end a year-long trade war, despite low expectations for progress and combative remarks from U.S. President Donald Trump. 
As U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin landed in the Chinese commercial hub on Tuesday, Trump accused Beijing on Twitter of stalling, and warned of a worse outcome for China if it continued to do so.
This week’s meetings, the first in-person trade talks since a G20 truce last month, come as an official survey showed China’s factory activity shrank for the third month in a row in July, underlining the growing strains placed on the world’s second-biggest economy by the trade war.
Vice Premier Liu He met and shook hands with Lighthizer and Mnuchin at Shanghai’s Xijiao State Guest Hotel in front of media on Wednesday morning ahead of the day’s negotiations, but the officials did not make any public remarks.
The trade row has dragged on for more than a year, with the world’s two largest economies slapping billions of dollars of tariffs on each other’s imports, disrupting global supply chains and shaking financial markets.
The Shanghai talks were expected to center on “goodwill” gestures, such as Chinese commitments to purchase U.S. agricultural commodities and steps by the United States to ease some sanctions on Chinese telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, a person familiar with the discussions told Reuters earlier.
Trump had said on Twitter that China appeared to be backing off on a pledge to buy U.S. farm goods, and he warned that if China stalled in the hope that he wouldn’t win re-election in the November 2020 U.S. presidential contest, the outcome will be worse for China.
“The problem with them waiting ... is that if & when I win, the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating now ... or no deal at all,” Trump said.
China’s state-owned Global Times tabloid said that U.S. negotiators should show sincerity and hold “reasonable expectations” after making “unrealistic demands that infringe upon China’s sovereignty and dignity”.
It said that if “Washington still holds the illusion that Beijing will somehow cave in and compromise on issues concerning sovereignty and other related core interests to reach a deal, then no deal is fine”.
The U.S. and Chinese delegations were scheduled to have had dinner at Shanghai’s historic riverfront Fairmont Peace Hotel on Tuesday night, but both teams avoided the media and did not make public comments.
The U.S. Commerce Department put Huawei on a national security blacklist in May, effectively banning U.S. firms from selling to Huawei, a move that enraged Chinese officials.
Trump had agreed last month to allow some sales to Huawei in a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but so far, U.S. semiconductor and software makers are still mostly in the dark about the administration’s plans.
In Sao Paulo on Tuesday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said decisions on license applications by U.S. firms to resume some sales to Huawei could come as early as next week.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-31-19/news_big_images/502976_82522541.jpg,business,"

"ECC approves Rs1 billion subsidy to reduce roti, naan prices","
ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Taking notice of a news published by Dunya News, which outlined miseries of the general public due to rising inflation in the state, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet on Wednesday in Islamabad approved a subsidy of Rs1 billion to cut the price of naan and roti at Tandoors.
According to details, the ECC has decided to restore gas tariff as of June 30, 2019, for Tandoorwalas.
At present naan is selling at Rs12 to Rs15 in different cities of the country. However, before an increase in the gas tariff and rates of wheat flour, naan price ranged between Rs8 and Rs10. Similarly, roti is available at Rs10 to Rs12 while its previous rate was Rs7 to Rs8.
Importantly, for supporting local cotton growers, the committee has approved imposition of 10 percent tax on imported cotton.
Besides, the ECC analysed a five-point agenda, including wheat reserves in the country, cotton price in 2019-20 and the approval of Economic Operator Programme in today’s meeting.
The meeting also considered summary of LNG imports and running of the LNG terminals to their full capacity.
The Ministry of National Food Security and Research briefed the cabinet in details about the wheat reserves, and its supply and demand in the state.
The summary was presented before the cabinet to set the support price for increasing domestic cotton production.
The ECC inspected measures to curb cotton prices in the domestic market through imports.
Another summary proposing imposition of duty and taxes on the import of cotton was considered in today’s meeting, and

Trade war keeps China's factories in reverse gear for third month,"
BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s factory activity shrank for the third month in a row in July, an official survey showed, underlining the growing strains on the world’s second-biggest economy as the Sino-U.S. trade war hits business profits, confidence and investment.
Wednesday’s weak manufacturing reading could fuel worries of a global recession and explains why policymakers around the world have stepped up easing measures, with some others considering doing so soon, to counter the fallout from international trade frictions.
The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 49.7 in July, China’s National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday, higher from the previous month of 49.4 but remains below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Analysts polled by Reuters predicted a reading of 49.6.
Deteriorating global demand left exporters struggling, with the survey showing export orders shrinking for the 14th month, though the sub-index ticked up fractionally to 46.9 from June’s 46.3. The contraction in total new orders also moderated slightly.
China’s factory output offered one brighter note, with growth quickening this month as the subindex rose to 52.1 from 51.3 in June.
The official gauge came on the second day of U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators’ meeting in Shanghai, their first in-person talks since a G20 truce last month.
Expectations for progress during the two-day meeting are low, so officials and businesses are hoping Washington and Beijing can at least detail commitments for “goodwill” gestures and clear the path for future negotiations.
In a row that has dragged on for more than a year, the world’s two largest economies have slapped billions of dollars of tariffs on each other’s imports, disrupting global supply chains and shaking financial markets. That has prompted central banks from India to Australia to South Africa to cut rates, with the U.S. Federal Reserve also widely expected to ease later on Wednesday for the first time since the global financial crisis.
The survey also showed persistent decline in orders from domestic customers, and even though demand conditions improved slightly it still remained worryingly weak despite a raft of recent stimulus measures.
Sluggish demand at home and abroad has led to a months-long spell of depressed activity for China’s manufacturers, and a sharp U.S. tariff hike announced in May threatens to crush already-thin profit margins.
Some manufactures have cut this year’s sales target as clients delay purchase orders in a wait-and-see approach, while others have already relocated their production capacity to neighboring countries to avoid the tariff hit.
The pressure on the manufacturing sector and weakening profits have prompted analysts’ warnings of a further period of stress for China before growth is expected to stabilize or recover.
So far, Beijing has relied on a combination of fiscal stimulus and monetary easing to weather the economic slowdown, including hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure spending and tax cuts for companies.
But the economy has been slow to respond, and business confidence remains shaky, weighing on investment.
Factories continued to cut jobs in July. The employment sub-index edged up to 47.1, compared with 46.9 in June.
China observers have said that Beijing’s recent growth-boosting measures will take time to filter through to the broader economy, and many analysts are of the view that further stimulus is needed to prevent a deeper downturn and to help stabilize growth.
A separate official business survey showed activity in China’s services sector grew at its slowest pace in 8 months in July, knocked by growing pressure on the broader economy from U.S. trade measures, with the official reading at 53.7 in July from 54.2 in June.
Beijing has been counting on a strong services sector to pick up the slack left by faltering trade as it tries to shift the economy away from a dependence on heavy industry and manufacturing exports.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-31-19/news_big_images/502951_16973968.jpg,business,"A separate official business survey showed activity in China’s services sector grew at its slowest pace in 8 months in July, knocked by growing pressure on the broader economy from U.S. trade measures, with the official reading at 53.7 in July from 54.2 in June.",neutral

Buraq Taxi Service to be launched in six cities of Pakistan on August 10,"
(APP) – Eyeing on the potential transport market, a Chinese company is all set to launch its online taxi service on August 10 in six big cities of the country, inviting competition with two such services already operating in the market.
Timesaco, the company launching the Buraq Taxi Service, has devised a comprehensive strategy to attract customers towards its newly established service for making it competitive, since two taxi services namely Careem and Uber are already operating in the market.
Chinese company Timesaco intends to provide a rapid services platform to citizens by launching five special services including a taxi service, heavy cargo delivery, orders delivery, moving automated teller machines (ATM) and vehicle advertisement facilities, Timesaco Chief Operating Officer  Donald Li had said a few days ago.
Initially these instant services would be launched in the six major cities including Karachi, Lahore, Faisalabad, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Peshawar and would be extended to other urban centers as well, he had maintained.

He said that special discount would also be provided to professionals including teachers, army personal and students.
He said that for Timesaco services, customers could download application from Google Play Store for instant services in all five major areas.
He said that people interested to work with Timesaco taxi services could register their vehicles with the company without any precondition.
Buraq drivers will get 97% share of their earring and company will get only 2% from drivers while one percent would be invested in Drivers’ Club for providing health and education services to families of drivers.
He said people could register their bikes, cars, rickshaws, pickups, qingqi loaders, and trucks with the company and get multiple ways for earning.
Talking about an elaborated programme of his company, he said that a comprehensive business plan had been worked out to provide five important services to citizens of Pakistan in six big cities, initially investing $20 million, with future prospects of $600 million.

China-US trade talks to restart after G20 tariff truce,"
BEIJING (AFP) - US and Chinese negotiators meet in Shanghai on Tuesday to resurrect trade talks between the world’s two biggest economies, with both sides downplaying expectations there will be an imminent deal.
The negotiations in China’s financial hub will be the first face-to-face discussions since negotiations collapsed in May, when US President Donald Trump accused China of reneging on its commitments.
Washington and Beijing have so far hit each other with punitive tariffs covering more than $360 billion in two-way trade, in a tense stand-off centred on demands for China to curb the alleged theft of American technology and provide a level-playing field to US companies.
The two days of talks are to be led on the US side by trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
The negotiations come as Beijing faces heavy pressure over ongoing civil unrest in Hong Kong, and with lingering ill-feeling between the US and China.
Days before the Shanghai meeting, Trump threatened to pull recognition of China’s developing nation status at the World Trade Organization -- prompting an irritable reply from Beijing about the ""arrogance and selfishness"" of the US, which state media said was using pressure ahead of the trade talks.
Trump said Friday he believed Chinese negotiators were hoping to delay a deal until after the US presidential election next year, adding: ""When I win... they’re all going to sign deals.""
The US leader has also angered the Chinese side by claiming the slowing economy is forcing them to make a trade deal, and blacklisting telecom giant Huawei over national security concerns.
But the kick-starting of trade negotiations is being seen as positive -- even if little of substance is expected -- following a truce agreed between Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping at the G20 in June.
""Realistically, this round of talks is about clarifying where the two sides stand after a significant lull in engagement,"" said Jake Parker, senior vice president at the US-China Business Council.
""There also needs to be a focus on rebuilding trust that was present in April but has since dissipated.""

‘Modest concessions’

Holding talks in Shanghai is also a nod to a time of better relations, as the home of the 1972 Shanghai Communique -- an important step in building diplomatic relations between the US and China.
Vice Premier Liu He will likely lead the talks for China again, with the addition of Chinese Commerce Minister Zhong Shan, seen as a tougher negotiator.
""Minister Zhong Shan, like Liu He, is a 19th Party Congress Central Committee member, so his involvement would indicate an elevation of participation on the Chinese side,"" said Parker.
""His appointment could offer another senior voice... on the Chinese side.""
But both sides were busy lowering expectations in the run-up to talks.
Mnuchin told CNBC last week there were still ""a lot of issues"" while Chinese state-run daily The Global Times wrote that it is ""widely believed that trade talks will take a long time"".
There are likely to be ""modest soft-pedalled concessions"", said Stephen Innes, managing partner at Vanguard Markets Singapore, such as new Chinese purchases of US agricultural products or a pause of further tariff increases on Chinese exports to the US.

England's Anderson apologised to team mates after re-injuring calf,"
(Reuters) - A “distraught” James Anderson apologised to his England team mates after pulling up injured on day one of the opening Ashes test against Australia, fellow quick Stuart Broad has revealed.
Anderson had been struggling to be fit for Thursday’s series opener at Edgbaston after tearing his calf while playing for his county, Lancashire, last month.
The 37-year-old seamer caused plenty of problems early on without taking a wicket before experiencing tightness in his right calf during his fourth over of the match.
“He is down, he’s frustrated... he actually came and said sorry to all the bowlers, not that he’s got anything to be sorry for,” Broad told reporters.
“He is distraught he couldn’t be out there today. He feels like he’s let the bowling group down but he hasn’t.
“Niggles are a part of fast bowling, but he’s down in the dumps as you’d expect.”
Anderson did not return to the field after being set for a scan during the lunch break.
“We don’t know the full extent yet,” Broad added. “All we can hope is the news is better than we expect.”
Without their record wicket-taker, England still managed to dismiss Australia for 284 as Broad stepped up to the occasion to claim 5-86.
Former England captain Michael Vaughan believes Anderson’s injury was a “massive turning point” in the five-test series.
“It looks like he won’t be available for a few weeks,” Vaughan told BBC.
“In hindsight, maybe Jimmy should have played last week (against Ireland) to see if his legs could stand up to a test match.”  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-02-19/news_big_images/503343_92621676.jpg,Cricket,"“In hindsight, maybe Jimmy should have played last week (against Ireland) to see if his legs could stand up to a test match.”",neutral

Smith ton takes Australia to 284 all out in first Ashes Test,"
BIRMINGHAM (AFP) – Steve Smith marked his return to Test cricket with a hundred before Australia were bowled out for 284 on the opening day of the Ashes series against England at Edgbaston on Thursday.
The former captain was playing his first match at this level since completing a 12-month ban for his role in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last year.
Australia were struggling at 17-2 when Smith walked in to bat after current captain Tim Paine won the toss.
And they were in dire straits at 122-8.
But their last two wickets more than doubled the score before Smith was last man out for 144 -- his 24th Test century.
Stuart Broad, who eventually bowled Smith, led England s attack with 5-86 in an innings in which 37-year-old spearhead James Anderson only managed four overs before leaving the field with a calf injury.
Ashes-holders Australia are looking to win their first Test series away to England for 18 years.
Australia captain Tim Paine won the toss and decided to bat in the first Ashes Test against England at Edgbaston.
Ashes-holders Australia have not won a match of any kind at Edgbaston since 2001, while England have won their past 11 internationals at the Birmingham ground.
Australia are looking for their first Ashes series win in England in 18 years.
""The wicket looks nice and hard and dry,"" said Paine at the toss. ""Hopefully we post a good total and we’ve got (off-spinner) Nathan Lyon up our sleeve at the back end of the game.""
As expected, the visitors included all three players given lengthy bans for their roles in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last year -- David Warner, Cameron Bancroft and former captain Steve Smith.
Openers Bancroft and Warner knew they would be booed on their way to the middle, judging by the hostile reception Warner and top-order batsman Smith received during the recent World Cup in England and Wales.
They did not have to wait even that long to face the boo-boys, with the Australia team as a whole jeered onto the field for a pre-match anthem ceremony -- an unusual occurrence before a Test match in England.
Reserve wicketkeeper Matthew Wade was included as a specialist batsman after making three hundreds for Australia A on their tour of England.
Usman Khawaja was also back in the top order following a hamstring injury that cut short his involvement in the World Cup, which saw Australia defeated by eventual champions England in an Edgbaston semi-final.
Australia also included experienced paceman Peter Siddle, who has been playing English county cricket this season for Essex, in an attack featuring James Pattinson and Pat Cummins.
""He’s a class performer there,"" said wicketkeeper Paine. ""He complements the other two seamers really nicely.""
But there was no place for World Cup spearhead Mitchell Starc.
England captain Joe Root named his side on Wednesday.
James Anderson, England’s all-time leading wicket-taker, returned after missing last week’s win in a one-off Test against Ireland at Lord’s.
But World Cup hero Jofra Archer was left waiting for a Test debut after struggling with a side injury.
Fellow World Cup winners Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler returned after being rested against Ireland.
Root had no qualms about losing the toss, saying: ""I’m not disappointed at all. It’s overcast conditions. It’ll be nice to get off to a good start.
""We’ve go so many great options to go to, especially with the ball. This morning is a great opportunity to exploit that.
""We love playing here, we get fantastic support wherever we go. The atmosphere here in particular is extremely exciting.""
The Edgbaston match is the first of a five-Test series and the first of the ICC’s new World Test Championship, with players’ names and squad numbers displayed on the backs of their shirts for the first time in this format.

England seek a 'double' as Australia eye Ashes history,"
BIRMINGHAM (AFP) – England return to ‘Fortress Edgbaston’ for the first Test against Australia on Thursday looking to round off an already memorable season by completing a World Cup and Ashes double.
If the World Cup remains the pinnacle of the 50-over game, for England and Australia there’s nothing quite like a renewal of Test cricket’s oldest rivalry.
But now there’s arguably more at stake for both sides than the series result.
For England, a home season billed as the most important in a generation started brilliantly with their impressive run to a first men’s World Cup title that culminated with a Super Over win in a dramatic final against New Zealand at Lord’s last month.
Building on that groundswell of support is a key part of the England and Wales Cricket Board’s post-tournament strategy, while regaining the Ashes represents an ideal chance to keep new fans on board.
""It’s huge. It’s a great opportunity,"" said England captain Joe Root.
""Cricket in this country is probably at an all-time high, it’s got interest it probably hasn’t had for a long time and we’ve got an opportunity as a team to make this summer a very memorable one.""
For Australia, an Ashes series win under the dignified leadership of Tim Paine would help draw a line under the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa that led to long bans for former captain Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft.
All three batsmen are likely to feature at Edgbaston, with Bancroft set to hear the same booing that greeted Smith and Warner during the World Cup.
Australia have not won an Ashes series in England for 18 years, with their batsmen struggling against the heavily stitched Dukes ball on pitches that offer seam movement.
""Everyone is excited, it’s a huge opportunity to come to England and do something even some of our great teams haven’t to do in the last 20 years,"" said Paine. ""We’ve got some self-belief we can do it.""
The way an England side featuring several World Cup stars were dismissed for just 85 by Ireland at Lord’s last week before winning the first Test between the countries tells its own story of ongoing top-order woes.
""Batting in the top order for England is difficult for anyone,"" said Paine, with Australia set to put their faith in a four-man pace attack featuring James Pattinson and Pat Cummins but without left-arm quick Mitchell Starc, their World Cup spearhead.

‘Lead from the front’

Root plans to move back to number three to help shore up a top order featuring novice Surrey openers Rory Burns and Jason Roy.
""I think it’s important to spread the experience out and it gives me an opportunity to lead from the front as well,"" he said.
Root gave his side an early vote of confidence by naming England’s XI on Wednesday rather than waiting for Thursday’s toss.
James Anderson, England’s all-time leading Test wicket-taker, returns after missing last week’s win over Ireland with a calf problem.
But there was no place for World Cup winner Jofra Archer, with the fast bowler’s Test debut put on hold while he regains full fitness following a side injury.
Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler, another two members of the triumphant World Cup team, return after being rested against Ireland.
Stokes is back as England’s vice-captain having lost the role to Buttler following a late night brawl in Bristol that culminated with the star all-rounder’s acquittal on a charge of affray last year.
""You know he is going to throw himself into it and he’s never going to ask something from you that he wouldn’t expect from himself,"" said Root of Stokes.
Australia have not won at Edgbaston in any format since 2001, a run that includes their recent World Cup semi-final loss to England.
England, by contrast, have won their last 11 internationals at the raucous Birmingham ground.
But a congested schedule, the result of officials cramming an Ashes into the same season as a lengthy World Cup, could have a bigger bearing on the series, the first in the ICC’s new World Test Championship. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-01-19/news_big_images/503168_31721011.jpg,Cricket,The way an England side featuring several World Cup stars were dismissed for just 85 by Ireland at Lord’s last week before winning the first Test between the countries tells its own story of ongoing top-order woes.,neutral

England paceman Archer misses out in opening Ashes test,"
LONDON (Reuters) - England pace bowler Jofra Archer has been omitted from the side for the first Ashes test against Australia starting at Edgbaston on Thursday with Chris Woakes keeping his place after his stunning display against Ireland last week.
Barbados-born Archer, who made a huge impact in England’s triumphant World Cup campaign, taking 20 wickets, is yet to play a test and has been suffering with a side strain.
Fellow paceman Olly Stone also misses out as does Sam Curran from the original 14-man squad.
Record test wicket taker James Anderson returns after recovering from a calf strain and will lead the attack with usual strike partner Stuart Broad.
All-rounder Ben Stokes is back to bolster the batting and bowling units after being rested for the Ireland match while Moeen Ali is the specialist spinner.
“Jofra is coming back from a serious injury,” England skipper Joe Root said on Wednesday.
“We looked at the conditions and went with what we thought was best to take 20 wickets here.”
Warwickshire’s Woakes, whose home pitch is Edgbaston, took six wickets in a magical spell of seam bowling as Ireland were dismissed for 38 to lose by 143 runs at Lord’s last week.
Archer will return to Sussex to play a Twenty20 Blast game.
While England’s bowling has a familiar look, the top order batting remains a worry with openers Rory Burns, Jason Roy and Joe Denly, who has dropped down to number four to allow Root to come in at three, having only 11 test caps between them.
Root says his elevation to a spot he has previously been reluctant to occupy was entirely his decision.
“It’s an opportunity for me to get in there earlier to spread out the experience,” he said. “It’s a really good chance for me to cement this spot and make it my own.
“Having captained this side for a while, I feel like a I can get my head around juggling leading on the field and batting.”
The return to the side of Jos Buttler to the middle order means wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow, who made a pair against Ireland, drops down to seven.

"Warner is Australia's dangerman, says Stokes","
LONDON (Reuters) - Australia’s returning batsman David Warner poses the biggest threat to England’s hopes of regaining the Ashes, according to all-rounder Ben Stokes who says his team mates must pressure the 32-year-old from the off.
Warner, former captain Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft are all returning to the test arena for the first time since serving bans for their roles in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last March — adding steel to Australia’s batting.
But it is Warner who Stokes believes is Australia’s key man.
“Warner is a player who can take games away from you,” Stokes was quoted in The Times on Wednesday.
“He is a phenomenal batsman and a very dangerous opener so to tie him down and not let him establish his authority against us would be a really big plus for us for the rest of the series.
“We don’t want to give anything away to any of their batsmen. We want to let them know that we’re here to be serious and everyone in the changing room is desperately trying to get that urn back.”
The five-match series begins at Edgbaston on Thursday — a ground England have turned into a fortress and have not lost a test against Australia since 2001.
Australia’s returning trio will get a vociferous ‘welcome’ from the home fans and Stokes said it will be vital for England to apply maximum pressure on the visitors on day one.
“That first morning of any series is when you want to stamp your authority as a team with bat and ball,” he said.
“You can’t feel your way into any Ashes series — you have to hit the ground running.
“Getting off to a good start can make it flow throughout the series and you want to be the team on top and you want to win that first day because hopefully that can carry on into the next four days.”
Stokes missed the 2017-18 Ashes defeat Down Under after his involvement in a brawl outside a Bristol nightclub in September 2017 but will be a key figure for England with bat and ball and as vice-captain to Joe Root.
While he has worked hard to clean up his act and Australia have been on a charm offensive after their disciplinary woes, Stokes knows that once hostilities begin on Thursday the mood could change.
“It is weird Aussies trying to be nice to you,” he said. “Once you get out in the middle and cross the white line, the real competitive side of both teams will come out and the Ashes is the biggest test series played in the world.
“There is always something that happens between teams in Ashes series and I don’t think this will be any different. Both teams are desperate to win.”  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-01-19/news_big_images/503165_32236552.jpg,Cricket,"“Getting off to a good start can make it flow throughout the series and you want to be the team on top and you want to win that first day because hopefully that can carry on into the next four days.”

"Australia's Khawaja, Pattinson confirmed for Ashes opener","
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia coach Justin Langer has confirmed James Pattinson and Usman Khawaja are certain starters for the opening Ashes test in Birmingham.
Khawaja passed a fitness test on Monday after recovering from a hamstring injury and Langer confirmed the left-hander will bat at number three, while fast bowler Pattinson is set to feature in his first test match since Feb. 2016.
“Usman Khawaja will definitely be in,” Langer told reporters. “He’s fit, ready to go, he’s playing well.
“He’s a seasoned pro for us, he averages 40-odd in Test cricket, his hammy (hamstring) is good, he’s running well, he’s passed all the fitness tests so he’s ready to go. He’ll bat number three.”
On Pattinson’s return to the lineup, Langer added: (He’s) just a very, very good bowler. I’m sure (captain Tim Paine) will work out ways of using him.”
Selectors face several crunch decisions ahead of the first test at Edgbaston starting Thursday, with Langer consigning Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and Peter Siddle to a three-way duel for the third specialist fast bowling spot.
“Like in all these selections, there’s literally a case for 17 blokes to play,” Langer said.
“There’s probably three to be fair, Starcy, Peter Siddle and Josh Hazlewood, for one spot.
“We won’t rotate them per se, but we’ll just pick the best three, probably not four, but three for every game. It won’t be different opposition, certainly different conditions.”
While Steve Smith and David Warner both featured and looked the part at the recent World Cup, Cameron Bancroft - the third player banned after the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last year - is still working his way back into the team.
Bancroft earned his Ashes call-up with an unbeaten knock of 93 in the intra-squad match last week and is now vying with Marcus Harris to open the batting alongside Warner.
“It would be a great story if (Bancroft) comes back into the team. His development after what happened in Cape Town has been extraordinary,” Langer said of the 26-year-old he previously coached for Western Australia.
“We know what the reception is going to be. There’s nothing we can do about it. We don’t know (how he will cope) but we’ll find out. He’s a good kid and as tough as anyone you could meet.”  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-01-19/news_big_images/503164_14169615.jpg,Cricket,"It won’t be different opposition, certainly different conditions.”

The ball factory arming swing king Anderson with his weapon of choice,"
LONDON (Reuters) - It is easy to imagine England’s record-breaking bowler James Anderson walking around Dilip Jajodia’s cricket ball factory in London’s East End wearing the expression of a child in a toy shop.
The sight of a box load of freshly polished cherry-red Dukes balls would surely quicken the pulse of the 37-year-old paceman, who has made the leather spheres his weapon of a choice over a distinguished test career.



Jajodia, managing director of British Cricket Balls Ltd, has been busy overseeing the production and delivery of the 60 Dukes balls that will be used in the five-test Ashes series between England and Australia, starting at Edgbaston on Thursday.
The reason Anderson’s eyes light up when he is thrown a new Dukes is that 368 of his 575 test wickets have come on home soil, where the ball has been the default during his long career.
Chuck him an Australia-manufactured Kookaburra, the brand used outside England and West Indies, and his bowling has been not nearly as effective.
The reason, Jajodia explains, is the pronounced hand-stitched seam that allows the Dukes ball to retain its “rudder” and aerodynamic qualities longer than machine-stitched balls.
Put simply, when delivered correctly, it swings more and for longer.
“A machine-stitched ball has two rows of stitches, with hand stitching there are six rows which hold the ball together and that means it retains its shape even after 60 overs,” he told Reuters as three employees lovingly prepared the next batch.
“The fascination of cricket is that the ball changes its characteristics to suit different style of bowling. The Dukes ball is crafted to deteriorate slowly over 80 overs.





“Whereas the seam on a machine-stitched ball tends to go flat after being whacked around for 60 overs, the seam on our balls remains pronounced even when it’s old.”
Jajodia bought the 259-year-old business in 1987 when the entire production process was carried out in Kent, to the south of the British capital.
PERFECT SPHERE
Since the mid-1990s, however, the raw material, premium-grade cow hide, has been sourced in Britain, cut into strips, then sent to the sub-continent to be stitched over the inner ball of rubber and cork by skilled craftsmen.
Four strips make up one ball with the highest-quality leather coming from close to the spine of the hide.
“Mix leather from the back with the stomach in one ball and it all goes pear-shaped,” Jajodia said.
Once stitched, the balls are shipped back to his Walthamstow premises for finishing.
That involves embossing the distinctive coat of arms, checking the size (maximum 9 inches) and weight (156-163g), then milling — a process where the ball is inserted into a vice-like round mould and gently squeezed to create a perfect sphere.
After that a wax is carefully melted into the leather before a final layer of polish is applied.
“The wax is heated when players rub the ball on their trousers and comes to the surface to renew the shine and help it swing,” Jajodi says.
Added to his global customers next year will be Australia’s Sheffield Shield state championship — a move that in the long term is sure to reduce the fear Australian batsmen sometimes experience when facing the unfamiliar Dukes.
Jajodia, though, dismisses any suggestion he was asked to produce a ball with an even more pronounced seam for the Ashes series.
“Actually, for the English county season the ECB asked us to slightly flatten the seam to give the batsmen more of a chance,” he said.
“But with the Ashes looming the powers that be said can we go back to the 2018 specification, the one the produced one of the best series ever against India.
“The modern game has become batter-friendly and I see the Dukes as evening it up a bit. But people think anyone can make a Dukes ball move in the air. It’s still an incredible skill.
“I watched the test at Lord’s last week (when England were bowled out for 85 and Ireland for 38) and it was amazing to watch. There was not much movement, but just enough.”
Anderson did not play in that match but he will be back at Edgbaston, Dukes ball in hand.

Clinical Sri Lanka whitewash 'negative' Bangladesh,"
COLOMBO (AFP) - Sri Lanka put on a clinical performance with bat and ball to record a 122-run win in the third and final one-day international and complete a clean sweep over Bangladesh in Colombo on Wednesday.
Former captain Angelo Mathews led Sri Lanka with 87 off 90 balls, guiding the side to 294-8 before Dasun Shanaka backed his 30 off 14 with three wickets for 27 runs to complete the rout.
Somuya Sarkar hit the only half-century for Bangladesh, 69 off 86 balls, but it gave Sri Lanka no trouble as the visitors were bowled out for 172.
Kasun Rajitha (2-17) and Lahiru Kumara (2-26) complemented Shanaka with the ball to complete the victory in 36 overs.
Leg-spinner Akila Dananjaya deceived Soumya with his flight to bowl the left-hander in the 32nd over for his only wicket, rendering the rest of the game a mere formality.
Tail-ender Taijul Islam s unbeaten 39 off 28 balls only managed to entertain a sparse crowd at the R. Premadasa Stadium and delay the result.
""I worked hard after getting dropped from the side. I was confident with my batting which helped me perform well. We re all relieved as a team because we performed together,"" Shanaka said after the match.
The home side won the first two matches respectively by 91 runs and seven wickets.
""There are a lot of negatives, starting from myself to the team. We have to hold it tight and come back strong,"" said Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal, who scored 21 runs in the three matches.
Mathews and Kusal Mendis, who made 54 off 58 balls, set the platform for Sri Lanka s big innings after skipper Dimuth Karunaratne won the toss and elected to bat first.
Mathews and Mendis put on 101 for the fourth wicket.
Bangladesh got an early breakthrough when Shafiul Islam removed Avishka Fernando for six but Karunaratne (46) and Kusal Perera (42) steadied the innings with an 83-run stand.
Left-arm spinner Taijul Islam removed Karunaratne to break the partnership and Rubel Hossain got rid of Perera in the next over to bring Bangladesh back into the contest.
But Mathews and Mendis snatched the momentum back thanks to some sloppy fielding by Bangladeshi players.
Mushfiqur Rahim dropped Mathews on 32 off Shafiul before Sabbir Rahman gave the former Sri Lankan captain another life on 63 off Mehidy Hasan s bowling.
Mathews, who hit eight fours and a six, was finally dismissed by Soumya Sarkar in the last over but not before Bangladesh reviewed a caught behind appeal initially dismissed by on-field umpire.
Soumya finished with 3-56 while medium pace Shafiul also claimed 3-68.
The island nation s cricket board has dedicated the match to pace bowler Nuwan Kulasekara who announced his retirement last week.
Tamim-led Bangladesh wore black armbands to pay respect to their first national captain, Shamim Kabir, who died on Monday.

England captain Root glad to have Stokes as his Ashes deputy,"
BIRMINGHAM (AFP) - England captain Joe Root is looking forward to having ""natural leader"" Ben Stokes back alongside him as his Test deputy during the Ashes.
The pair have been friends since their days playing youth cricket, with Root lobbying for Stokes s return to a position the all-rounder held until he was involved in a street brawl in Bristol in 2017.
Stokes missed five months of international cricket, including England s 4-0 Ashes series loss in Australia under Root, before being cleared of affray in a court case in August 2018.
But the 28-year-old was one of the stars of England s triumphant World Cup campaign earlier this season and Root, also involved in that success, is eager to have Stokes back as his Test vice-captain after Jos Buttler took over the role.
""I have asked for a long time (to have Stokes back as vice-captain) but he was made available at the end of the World Cup,"" Root said during his pre-match press conference at Edgbaston on Wednesday, on the eve of the series opener.
""It is fantastic to have Ben back, not just playing and playing back somewhere near his best -- it has been coming a long time.
""The way he stepped up in big moments in that World Cup was just him down to a tee. It is what he does -- he responds well to responsibility and to the big moments.
""He offers with all three departments -- he bowls, bats and he is one of the best fielders and he drags people with him as a natural leader on the field and in the dressing room.""
Root praised Buttler but said Buttler was aware Stokes would be brought back as vice-captain when there was an opportunity to do so.
England s World Cup win under the leadership of one-day specialist Eoin Morgan achieved a long-held goal but Root rejected suggestions that meant the pressure to regain the Ashes had eased as a result.
""I think if you speak to anyone who has captained England and is on the verge of an Ashes series, to say it doesn t mean as much as any other event, I don t think any of them would agree,"" he said.
""It s huge. It s a great opportunity. Cricket in this country is probably at an all-time high, it s got interest it probably hasn t had for a long time and we ve got an opportunity as a team to make this summer a very memorable one.""
Root is going back up to number three in the batting order and Joe Denly dropping down to four as England look to shore up their struggling line-up.
""I think it s important to spread the experience out and it gives me an opportunity to lead from the front as well,"" said Root, England s best batsman.
""I also feel I m in a place where I ve got my head around the captaincy and my batting and I m able to separate the two.""

Australia captain Paine feels no pressure for his place as Ashes loom,"
BIRMINGHAM (AFP) - Australia captain Tim Paine says he has no fears about losing his place as he prepares to lead his team in the first Ashes Test against England on Thursday.
The wicketkeeper found himself unexpectedly thrust into a leadership position in the fall-out from last year s ball-tampering scandal in South Africa.
Then-captain Steve Smith and David Warner, his deputy, were stripped of their positions by Cricket Australia after the incident and both were banned from international cricket for 12 months.
Australia s squad for the Ashes includes another wicketkeeper in Matthew Wade, who has already played 22 Tests.
Wade has been in fine form with the bat during the recent Australia A tour of England, scoring three hundreds.
By contrast, Paine has managed just one first-class century in his entire career.
Asked during a pre-match press conference at Edgbaston on Wednesday if he felt under pressure to justify his place, Paine replied: ""No, I do not at all. I m 34 years old, I don t really care about my place in the side any more. I m here to do a job.
""I ve been put in this team to captain and wicket-keep to the best of my ability and I ve said before, at 34 years of age, if you are looking further ahead than the next Test match you are kidding yourself.
""I m not going to waste time looking over my shoulder. I m enjoying the job that I m doing.""
With Cameron Bancroft, the man who applied sandpaper to the ball during that fateful Test in Cape Town, also set to be included in Australia s team for the Ashes opener alongside Smith and Warner, there will be a renewed focus on the tourists  on-field conduct.
But the side, under the leadership of Australia one-day captain Aaron Finch, conducted themselves in exemplary fashion during the recent World Cup in England and Wales.
Paine said they were taking their cue from Winston Churchill although there is doubt over whether Britain s prime minister during World War II ever said the words ascribed to him by the Australians.
""We are going to play competitive Test match cricket like every other nation does,"" he said.
""Our guys understand what s expected of them and we are role models,"" added Paine, with Australia looking to win their first Ashes series in England since 2001.
""There s been a quote going around our changing rooms this week from Winston Churchill and that is  behaviour doesn t lie .
""We can talk all we like about how we are going to play and ultimately you guys will see how we play and judge for yourselves,"" added Paine, who said the tourists had been made aware of the quote by assistant coach Brad Haddin, the former Australia wicketkeeper who was renowned for  sledging  or verbally abusing opponents during his playing days.
Meanwhile Paine was glad of the strength in depth of an Australia fast-bowling unit where Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, James Pattinson, Josh Hazlewood and Peter Siddle are all vying for a place in the side.
""We are in a really good situation at the moment where we have a number of quality fast bowlers in particular,"" Paine said.
""We are lucky that we feel we have a lot of bases covered,"" added the skipper who said Australia would name their team at the toss, unlike England, who confirmed their side on Wednesday.
""It s up to us to come up with the best combinations to take 20 wickets.
""Our quicks that have been here before, have learnt lessons from being here before. It s important that we learn from them and put what we ve learnt into practice in this series.""

Australia eager to end Edgbaston hoodoo,"
BIRMINGHAM (AFP) - Australia head into the first Test at Edgbaston determined to complete ""unfinished business"" as they look to end their long record without a win at England s  fortress .
You have to go back to the 2001 Ashes for the last time Australia enjoyed a a victory of any kind at the Birmingham ground.
That winless streak across all formats at Warwickshire s headquarters was extended to 15 matches when they lost to England in a World Cup semi-final earlier this month.
By contrast, England have won their last 11 internationals at the ground.
With England looking to regain the Ashes, and Australia not having won them on English soil in 19 years, Edgbaston appears to be the perfect venue for the series opener from the home side s perspective.
But Australia s Matthew Wade said the tourists would love nothing more than to make a little bit of history of their own at the venue.
""I feel like Edgbaston is unfinished business for a lot of us,"" said Wade, who is hoping to make his first Test appearance in almost two years.
""A lot of us haven t got good memories here, so we have to create some now. They ve got a great record here but what s happened before doesn t really matter.
""I think this is the start of another chapter and we re excited to get out there. Edgbaston is a hectic crowd, all the crowds are over here, but as long as we re enjoying each other s company out there then the other noise doesn t really bother us.""
Wade made his name as a wicketkeeper but with the gloves now taken by Australia captain Tim Paine, a fellow Tasmanian, the 31-year-old is looking to relaunch his Test career as a specialist batsman.
""I basically started a whole different career playing solely as a batter,"" said Wade, a veteran of 22 Tests.
""Being here is a reward for a lot of hard work over a two-year period. I ve really enjoyed not keeping...there s not that sickening feeling every time you walk out to keep in a session.
""I find it a lot easier to streamline my training. When you re keeping in Test cricket you have to put a boatload of work into it.
""Over in England it s as important as scoring runs.""

"Nash, who was hit by Sobers for six sixes in an over, dies at 74","
LONDON (AFP) - Malcolm Nash, the Glamorgan bowler who entered cricket folklore when Garfield Sobers struck him for six sixes in an over, has died at the age of 74.
Nash s name was forever linked with that of Sobers after the West Indies star went on the attack during a County Championship match between Glamorgan and Nottinghamshire at Swansea in 1968.
It was the first time any batsman had hit six sixes in an over in first-class cricket.
The first five balls were dispatched cleanly by the West Indian and the sixth was carried over the ropes by a fielder.
Sobers had been frustrated by his team s slow progress as Nottinghamshire were approaching a declaration and Nash was experimenting with slow bowling.
Nash, a left-armer, took 993 first-class wickets in a 17-year career between 1966 and 1983, while also scoring 7,129 runs and holding 148 catches.
""Malcolm was a true Glamorgan legend whose exploits have gone down in club folklore,"" chief executive Hugh Morris told the club s website.
""His name is connected with that of Garry Sobers... but he was a fantastic cricketer who was an integral part of the club s history and the side that lifted the County Championship in 1969.""
Nash died in hospital in London after being taken ill at a function at Lord s Cricket Ground on Tuesday.

"Australia's Khawaja, Pattinson confirmed for Ashes opener","
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia coach Justin Langer has confirmed James Pattinson and Usman Khawaja are certain starters for the opening Ashes test in Birmingham.
Khawaja passed a fitness test on Monday after recovering from a hamstring injury and Langer confirmed the left-hander will bat at number three, while fast bowler Pattinson is set to feature in his first test match since Feb. 2016.
“Usman Khawaja will definitely be in,” Langer told reporters. “He’s fit, ready to go, he’s playing well.
“He’s a seasoned pro for us, he averages 40-odd in Test cricket, his hammy (hamstring) is good, he’s running well, he’s passed all the fitness tests so he’s ready to go. He’ll bat number three.”
On Pattinson’s return to the lineup, Langer added: (He’s) just a very, very good bowler. I’m sure (captain Tim Paine) will work out ways of using him.”
Selectors face several crunch decisions ahead of the first test at Edgbaston starting Thursday, with Langer consigning Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and Peter Siddle to a three-way duel for the third specialist fast bowling spot.
“Like in all these selections, there’s literally a case for 17 blokes to play,” Langer said.
“There’s probably three to be fair, Starcy, Peter Siddle and Josh Hazlewood, for one spot.
“We won’t rotate them per se, but we’ll just pick the best three, probably not four, but three for every game. It won’t be different opposition, certainly different conditions.”
While Steve Smith and David Warner both featured and looked the part at the recent World Cup, Cameron Bancroft - the third player banned after the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last year - is still working his way back into the team.
Bancroft earned his Ashes call-up with an unbeaten knock of 93 in the intra-squad match last week and is now vying with Marcus Harris to open the batting alongside Warner.
“It would be a great story if (Bancroft) comes back into the team. His development after what happened in Cape Town has been extraordinary,” Langer said of the 26-year-old he previously coached for Western Australia.
“We know what the reception is going to be. There’s nothing we can do about it. We don’t know (how he will cope) but we’ll find out. He’s a good kid and as tough as anyone you could meet.”",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-31-19/news_big_images/502979_46914730.jpg,Cricket,"It won’t be different opposition, certainly different conditions.”

England captain Root returns to No. 3 spot for Ashes opener,"
BIRMINGHAM (AFP) - Joe Denly confirmed on Tuesday that he would drop to number four in the batting order for England s opening Ashes Test against Australia, with captain Joe Root replacing him at number three.
Root has previously made clear he prefers batting at four but the Yorkshireman is understood to have approached England coach Trevor Bayliss after last week s Test win over Ireland about returning to his old position when the Ashes opener starts at Edgbaston on Thursday.
Although England beat Ireland by skittling out the visitors for 38 in their second innings at Lord s, they only managed 85 all out themselves in their first innings.
Bayliss has long wanted Root, England s best batsman, to bat at number three following a succession of top-order collapses that have seen the skipper walking out to bat at four when two cheap wickets have fallen.
Root averages 48 at number four in the order but a shade over 40 when batting at number three.
But with England openers Jason Roy and Rory Burns having played just eight Tests between them, the logic in having 81-Test veteran Root bat at number three is clear.
Denly, speaking at Edgbaston on Tuesday, said: ""Joe Root will bat at three and I ll be batting at four.
""He rang me the other day and told me he wanted to bat three and for me to go in at four. I think Rooty just wanted to get involved in the game, get up there and get out in the middle.""
""I m very excited. I wasn t too fussed where I d be batting, it s just great to be in the eleven. I ve batted at four before for Kent and throughout my career, so it really wasn t a big issue,"" he added. ""I m just happy to be playing.""
Denly may be 33 but the Kent batsman has played just three Tests and this will be his first Ashes series.
He had a brief stint as a limited-overs international a decade ago but it seemed Test cricket had passed him by.
However, a return to form and the arrival of his former Kent teammate Ed Smith as national selector saw him given a Test debut against the West Indies in Antigua earlier this year.
""Everyone from a young age dreams of playing in an Ashes series and to finally get that chance, being quite an old campaigner, I m certainly excited and up for the challenge,"" said Denly.
""There s no doubt that the Australian bowling line-up is one of the best in the world. They have all bases covered really and, as a top-order batter, that is where you want to be, testing yourself against the best.""
Denly just missed out on a place in England s triumphant World Cup squad, being replaced by Hampshire spinner Liam Dawson, who did not play a game.
""I think it was the right decision,"" he said. ""I thought it might happen and it was a great opportunity for me to go back and play some red-ball cricket with Kent and get some good form going into this series.""

Langer predicts hostile Ashes reception for Bancroft from England fans,"
BIRMINGHAM (AFP) - Australia coach Justin Langer says an Ashes return for Cameron Bancroft would be ""a great story"" but knows he will face a hostile reception from England fans after his ball-tampering ban.
Bancroft, 26, is set to open the batting in Thursday s first Test at Edgbaston, with Australia s top order also likely to feature David Warner and Steve Smith.
If that is the case, it would mean all three players who were banned for their roles in the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last year would be in Australia s XI.
Smith and Warner have already experienced plenty of boos from English crowds during the recent World Cup.
Bancroft, not selected for the one-day tournament, will almost certainly experience more of the same given he was the one who actually applied sandpaper to the ball during a Test away to South Africa in a blatant flouting of cricket s rulebook.
""It would be a great story if he comes back into the team,"" Langer said at Edgbaston on Tuesday.
""His development after what happened in Cape Town has been extraordinary.""
Langer, a former Australia opener, said: ""We know what the reception is going to be. There s nothing we can do about it. We don t know (how he will cope) actually, but we ll find out.
""He s a good kid and as tough as anyone you could meet. To endure the scrutiny of the past 14 months, especially the first part of it, I think he s had a pretty good dress rehearsal.""
Langer confirmed batsman Usman Khawaja, who missed Australia s World Cup semi-final defeat by England at Edgbaston with a hamstring injury, had been passed fit and would play in the opening match of the five-Test series.
""He s a seasoned pro for us, he averages 40-odd in Test cricket, his hammy is good, he s running well, he s passed all the fitness tests, so he s ready to go,"" Langer said.
Fast bowler James Pattinson is also set to feature in what would be his first Test since February 2016, lining up alongside Pat Cummins and one of Mitchell Starc, Peter Siddle or Josh Hazlewood in Australia s pace attack.
""There s probably three to be fair -- Starcy, Peter Siddle and Josh Hazlewood -- for one spot,"" added Langer.
Australia hold the Ashes but have not won a Test series away to England since 2001.

Broadway icon Harold Prince dead at 91,"
NEW YORK (AFP) - Broadway director and producer Harold Prince -- who brought some of the most successful musicals ever to the stage including ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and won a record 21 Tony awards -- died Wednesday after a short illness. He was 91.
Tributes poured in for Prince, whose glittering career lasted more than 60 years and featured several hit collaborations with fellow musical theater royalty Stephen Sondheim (""Company"" and ""Sweeney Todd"") and Andrew Lloyd Webber (""Phantom"" and ""Evita"").
Lloyd Webber described him as ""the prince of musicals.""
""This wonderful man taught me so much and his mastery of musical theater was without equal,"" the British composer wrote on Twitter.
Prince -- called ""Hal"" by those close to him -- passed away in Reykjavik, Iceland, his publicist said in a statement emailed to AFP.
He leaves behind his wife of 56 years, Judy; a son and a daughter, and three grandchildren.
""As per his wishes, there will be no funeral but there will be a celebration of his life this fall with the people he loved most, the members of the theatrical community that he was a part of for seven decades,"" the spokesman said.
Prince was born in New York on January 30, 1928, getting his first foot through the theater door as an assistant to producer-director George Abbott in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
He shot to fame as a co-producer of Abbott s ""The Pajama Game,"" which won the 1955 Tony for best musical.
Prince enjoyed further success with ""Cabaret"" in 1966 before starting a long and fruitful partnership with Sondheim, which brought a string of accolades.
Their 1970 comedy ""Company"" won six Tony awards, including best musical. ""Follies,"" which opened the following year, went one better, picking up seven Tonys.
""A Little Night Music"" (1973) and ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" (1979) both won Tonys for best musical. The latter also collected an Olivier Award for Best New Musical.
Prince directed Lloyd Webber s hit musicals ""Evita"" (1978 in London s West End) and ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" which opened in London in 1986 and went on to become the longest-running show in Broadway history.
He received a special Tony Award for lifetime achievement in 2006.
""I am saddened beyond words,"" said actress-dancer Chita Rivera, who starred in the Prince-directed London and Broadway productions of ""Kiss of the Spider Woman.""
""There are some people you feel we will never be without. Hal is one of them. I owe so much to him. He knows my love for him.""

MUMBAI (Dunya News) – Bollywood actor Govinda, while revealing the reason behind not signing James Cameron’s blockbuster film ‘Avatar’, said that he refused the offer as he couldn’t set aside 410 days for the shooting.

He also claimed that he suggested the movie name to Cameron.

Miley Cyrus latest star to abandon Woodstock 50,"
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Miley Cyrus was reported on Tuesday to have pulled out of the troubled Woodstock 50 festival, joining a string of other big names who say they will no longer take part in the official event meant to mark the anniversary of the landmark 1969 music festival.

Cyrus, one of America’s biggest pop stars, was one of the headliners for the event planned for Aug. 16-18, which has been mired in financial and permit problems.

Variety and Rolling Stone cited sources close to the situation as saying Cyrus would no longer take part. Representatives of the “Wrecking Ball” singer did not return requests for comment.

Rapper Jay-Z withdrew last week, along with former Creedence Clearwater Revival frontman John Fogerty as Woodstock 50 organizers sought a third venue, this time at a small amphitheater in Columbia, Maryland. 

In the past few days Dead & Company, Carlos Santana, and rock bands the Lumineers and the Raconteurs have also pulled out, their representatives told Rolling Stone magazine.

Tickets have yet to go on sale for the festival, which, according to media reports, may now be a free, one-day event with an attendance scaled down from more than 100,000 to around 30,000.

Woodstock 50, with an 80-act lineup, was first planned for the Watkins Glen motor racing venue in upstate New York, but the site pulled out in June. Organizers then attempted in vain to seek permits in Vernon, New York.

The proposed new venue is the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Maryland.

The nonprofit Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, the current owner of the field where the 1969 Woodstock festival took place, has also scaled back plans for a three-day anniversary event. It said in February it will instead host separate concerts by Ringo Starr, Santana and the Doobie Brothers.

Salman Khan gifts diamond ring to lulia Vantur on her birthday: reports,"
Mumbai (Online): If the industry buzz is to be believed, Salman Khan gifted rumoured girlfriend Iulia Vantur a diamond ring on her birthday last week. 

The superstar is known to splurge on his near and dear ones, so it is not exactly a surprise. But what has set tongues wagging is that it is a diamond ring and not just any bauble. Is there more to it or should we not read too much into it? Time will tell.

Meanwhile, sharing the excitement with the fans, Iulia Vantur also shared a few snaps and videos and wrote: ""Thank u for making my day & my life more beautiful. I’m grateful for your love, friendship and care. Thank u for all your beautiful messages. I’m sending to each one of u a lot of love and gratitude. It s all about love #iuliavantur #birthday #friends #love [sic]""

On the professional front, Iulia Vantur’s Bollywood debut vehicle Radha Kyun Gori Main Kyun Kala had hit a roadblock after producer Prernaa Arora was arrested by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) in December, for allegedly cheating Vashu Bhagnani of Rs 32 crore. Now, the movie is back on track.

Talking about Salman Khan’s work commitments, he is currently shooting for Dabangg 3, and the actor will soon start for the second instalment of Kick. Sajid Nadiadwala is working round the clock to get an interesting script ready for the film to go on floors in 2020. Once the script is locked, the crew will hunt for locations.

As of now, Salman Khan is reprising his role of Devil, and other star casts are yet to be signed.

Meanwhile, in Dabangg 3, the makers have decided upon having a sizzling dance number in the instalment. However, there’s a twist this time. The dance song will not have a female but male actor, and he is none other than Salman Khan himself. He will be seen dancing on the song Munna Badnaam Hua. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-30-19/news_big_images/502777_84672917.jpg,entertainment,"Meanwhile, sharing the excitement with the fans, Iulia Vantur also shared a few snaps and videos and wrote: ""Thank u for making my day & my life more beautiful.",neutral

Mega-hit 'Old Town Road' breaks US singles chart record,"
NEW YORK (AFP) - Overnight sensation Lil Nas X continued his wild ride of pop music domination Monday, taking the reins of the record for longest stretch atop the US singles chart at 17 weeks with his infectious country-trap smash ""Old Town Road.""
The viral mega-hit that mashes banjo twangs with thumping bass from the unknown artist-turned-industry maverick topped the Billboard record of 16 weeks on the industry s most closely watched singles chart.
That was set by 1995 s ""One Sweet Day"" by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men and matched by the 2017 Latin juggernaut ""Despacito"" by Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber.
""YEEE TF HAWWW,"" Lil Nas X tweeted after the news broke.
After first grabbing attention on the video-sharing app TikTok, Lil Nas X, 20, soared into the public consciousness when his genre-bending hit booted Ariana Grande from the Billboard chart s overall spot in April, also fending off advances from pop royalty including Bieber and Taylor Swift.
Since then, the meme king has shrewdly goosed his numbers by releasing remix after remix of the snappy track, most notably with country star Billy Rae Cyrus, which is the one listed on the Billboard chart.
As long as remixes are in line with the original sound of a song, the streams, downloads and sales are included in one composite number.
Just last week, Lil Nas X released yet another new version featuring a member of BTS, the wildly popular South Korean group -- a remix that appeared to ensure the artist would maintain his rule.
In its unprecedented 17th week on the Billboard Hot 100, ""Road"" notched 72.5 million US streams and 46,000 downloads sold. Its numbers again bested breakout pop star Billie Eilish, whose song ""bad guy"" has held the number two spot for seven total weeks.
Controversy famously stoked the artist s rise to fame after Billboard removed the fusion novelty song from the country charts but left it on the rap list, triggering accusations that the Atlanta musician s work was pigeonholed purely because he is black.
He never returned to the country chart -- despite the collaboration with Cyrus -- but his unstoppable hit has stayed atop the Hot R&B/Hip Hop and Hot Rap songs chart for 17 weeks.
In a lengthy tweeted note filled with emojis, the artist born Montero Lamar Hill said that just last year he was struggling and living on his sister s couch: ""I jokingly/seriously saw myself as a loner cowboy need to run away from it all.""
His breakout song ""needed to be funny, it need to be catchy, it needed to be hip hop, it needed to be country & it needed to be short,"" he continued.
""This song has changed my life and the way i see the world around me in less than a year,"" he said. ""It s just the beginning!""
Since the release of ""Road,"" Lil Nas X has also dropped an EP entitled ""7,"" which includes the aforementioned megahit s original and Billy Rae Cyrus remix along with a song featuring rap star Cardi B.
Asked earlier whether she was worried about the prospect of losing her record to the novice artist, diva Carey deadpanned: ""Darling, no.""
On Twitter, he had invited the pop icon to record a remix of the song with him, which she responded to by posting a picture of herself in a cowboy hat with the caption ""One Sweet Town Road!""
Lil Nas X had told TMZ he might send Carey roses upon breaking her record, ""since I love her.""

It was just not the look but the action sequences were also to be performed by him, for which he had to get fit.

On the first day of training he could’nt even do push-ups nor did his kicks got higher than an inch or two. But he was motivated and inspired by the likes of Mohammad Ali. He trained for 4-5 hours a day and by the end of the training was ready to perform all the fight sequences.

Bulgarian singer hits high with record-breaking vocals,"
STAROSEL (AFP) - Smilyana Zaharieva knew she had a gift when she saw her audience tremble or cry during her performances.
Now an official Guinness world record confirms that the Bulgarian singer has one of the most powerful voices on the planet, which can stay pitch perfect despite being as loud as a rock concert.
Zaharieva says she burst into tears when she received the official Guinness world record certificate last month, confirming she had achieved the loudest mezzo-soprano vocal note.
""When I saw the monitor reading 113.8 decibels, it surprised me,"" the 48-year-old told AFP of her record-setting attempt last September.

Tough requirements 


Irish teacher Annalisa Flanagan holds the world’s loudest shouting record with 121 decibels (dB), but there was no previous singing record.
The lively Bulgarian from the southern city of Plovdiv faced a series of tough requirements.
Zaharieva had to sing in a quiet studio and go over 110 dB, the average human discomfort threshold, with the sound meter placed 2.5 metres (8.2 feet) away from her while also holding the note for a minimum of five seconds.
According to popular noise level charts Zaharieva’s achievement of 113.8 dB roughly amounts to the same loudness you would hear at a rock concert, a symphony orchestra or an emergency vehicle siren.
""The Bulgarian folklore voice is characterised by its power,"" says Dora Hristova, the longtime choir master of the world-famous The Mystery Of The Bulgarian Voices.
""Folk singers are born with this physiology, with this natural voice.""

‘Exceptional register ‘ 


As a child, Zaharieva studied folk singing in the National School of Folklore Art in the Rhodope mountains in southern Bulgaria before pursuing a degree from the Plovdiv Conservatory of Music.
For several years she was part of another women’s choir, The Great Voices of Bulgaria, touring the world.
""When I sang people would tremble or cry,"" she said.
But in 1996 she put an end to her career.
""One day when I returned home, my little daughter didn’t recognise me. That broke my heart,"" she said.
Opening a tour agency with her husband, she only sang for her family and close friends. ""But I felt a void. My voice pushed to resurface,"" she recalls.
In 2015, she set herself the challenge of singing with 101 traditional Rhodope bagpipes, the ""kaba gaida"" -- and her voice held its own.
Svetla Stanilova, head of the Plovdiv Conservatory of Music, recognised Zaharieva’s ""amazing vocal abilities"" and ""exceptional register"".
""The loudness of the voice is an individual quality but it is not the most important one... beauty depends on the voice’s timbre,"" explains Stanilova, one of several experts present at the Guinness World Records attempt.
""From all the 26 classes that I’ve taught, I haven’t heard another folklore voice with a similar range.""
Sofia opera director Plamen Kartaloff was more Skeptical on the record: ""What a funny idea to measure one’s voice!"" he said, adding several opera singers known for their voices -- perhaps more powerful than Zaharieva’s -- never had theirs measured.

Madonna as collaborator? 


Keen on yoga and interested in Eastern meditation techniques, Zaharieva wants to explore the curative effects of sound and is seeking to collaborate with other artists. She has already asked American pop-star Madonna.
""This voice that has been given to me, I want to use it to help people and find a message to convey,"" said the mother-of-two and recent grandmother of twins.
Zaharieva uses the crystal lyre instrument, known for its soothing, relaxing and meditative effects, and a chain of large bells -- ""chanove"" -- from the Rhodope mountains in sessions she both participates in and organises.
""Each sound corresponds to an energy centre in the body and to an organ,"" the singer explains, adding various combinations of sound can cure illnesses. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-29-19/news_big_images/502647_96201308.jpg,entertainment,"he said, adding several opera singers known for their voices -- perhaps more powerful than Zaharieva’s -- never had theirs measured.",neutral

LOS ANGELES (AFP) - Disney s ""The Lion King"" held on to its reign in North American theaters,  taking in $75.5 million over the three-day weekend, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations said on Sunday.
The healthy haul for the Disney production brought its total to $350.8 million and put it on top of the box office for the second week in a row, capping a streak of successes for the studio after its ""Avengers: Endgame"" was last week named the highest-grossing movie of all time and now has global box office earnings of $2.7924 billion.
Directed by Jon Favreau, ""The Lion King"" is a remake of the 1994 animated film, employing hyper-realistic computer-generated images with a voice cast including Donald Glover as Simba and Beyonce as Nala, together with Seth Rogen, Chiwetel Ejiofor and James Earl Jones.
Despite rave reviews, director Quentin Tarantino s ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood,"" came in a distant second place with $40.4 million.
The ninth of the 10 movies Tarantino has said he will make before retiring, ""Once Upon a Time"" is set in Tinseltown in 1969 and features an ensemble cast typical of the director s work, with Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Dakota Fanning and Al Pacino among the stars.
""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" came in third in its fourth week with $12.2 million. Continuing where ""Avengers: Endgame"" left off, the production by Sony and Disney s Marvel Studios is the latest installment in the blockbuster franchise, with Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man leading a cast that includes Samuel L. Jackson, Zendaya and Jake Gyllenhaal.
""Toy Story 4,"" came in fourth, taking in $9.9 million in its sixth week in cinemas, which have brought it more than $395.6 million in total.
The latest installment in the family-friendly Disney/Pixar animation franchise that began in 1995, the movie features the voices of Tom Hanks (Woody) and Tim Allen (Buzz Lightyear).
The fifth spot went to Paramount s ""Crawl,"" with $4 million in its third week. Barry Pepper and Kaya Scodelario play a father and daughter battling hungry gators after a hurricane hits their Florida town.

VENTSPILS (AFP) - Soaring to new musical heights, a German-born innovator has crafted what is believed to be the world’s largest grand piano.
It is without question one of a kind: attached high on the wall of a concert hall in Latvia, the steel-framed vertical grand piano hangs as if in mid-air some three storeys above the audience.
To play it, pianists must climb a steep flight of steel stairs to a balcony.
Although the Guinness Book of World Records has not yet measured the new instrument, it was made by David Klavins whose Model 370 piano unveiled in 1987 is currently regarded as being among the world’s largest.
Klavins’ standard new model, the 470i Vertical Concert Grand piano, has strings that are 4.7 metres long.
The custom-built 470i piano installed at a new concert hall in the Baltic seaside port and resort town of Ventspils is even larger; its imposing navy blue-painted steel frame is six metres high.
With some strings measuring almost five metres, the instrument emits bold, sonorous music.
""The most suitable music for this instrument would be all the very expressive works, for example Rachmaninoff, Scriabin but also Beethoven’s sonatas would sound totally different on this instrument,"" Klavins told AFP.
The innovator, who has Latvian roots, has worked on pianos nearly all his life, driven by a desire to push the boundaries of the instrument first created by Italian Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700.

High school dropout 


""Since I was 16 years old and dropped out of school to become a piano restoration apprentice, I have been trying to explore new designs and principles, which deviate from the 140-year-old construction of the traditional grand piano,"" Klavins, now 65, told AFP while sitting at the 450i.
He crafted his first vertical piano in 1985. Now at his workshop, the Klavins Piano Manufaktura based in the town of Vac just north of the Hungarian capital Budapest, he dreams up his signature vertical designs.
It is not just his new instrument’s mammoth size that makes it stand out; having no wooden casing means that audiences seated in the concert hall can see its long, steely strings.
Laying them bare in this way lets music lovers ""hear every sound nuance unmuted,"" Klavins said.
Opening this Friday in Ventspils, the Latvija venue where the piano is installed, boasts two concert halls with a combined seating capacity of 1,000. It is also home to a music academy for emerging young talent.
""Traditional pianos are meant to be transported in and out of the concert venues, but my vertical design has to be mounted on the building’s structure,"" Klavins said.

Size matters 


""The size of the piano and length of strings do not set records for a record’s sake: the idea is to create the best imaginable sound for all the performers and listeners who come to this particular hall,"" he added.
On display to the public for the first time on Friday, the instrument has already created a buzz among piano enthusiasts.
""Composers and performers from all around are interested in playing the new Klavins piano, which will open new avenues of artistic expression for them,"" said Miks Magone, the creative head of the new concert venue.
Pianist Lubomyr Melnyk from Canada, known for a technique using an extremely rapid succession of notes, will be among the first to play the 450i next week, Magone said.
One of six German pianists will also use it in a performance of ""Six Pianos"" by Steve Reich, he added.
Ventspils Mayor Aivars Lembergs has his fingers crossed that the record-breaking piano will help the industrial port city of 40,000 rebrand itself into a family-friendly tourist destination.
""We’re hoping to attract foreign music lovers as well,"" he said. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-28-19/news_big_images/502448_97929471.jpg,entertainment,"On display to the public for the first time on Friday, the instrument has already created a buzz among piano enthusiasts.",neutral

Facebook says it dismantles covert influence campaign tied to Saudi government,"
LONDON (Reuters) - People connected to the government of Saudi Arabia have run a network of fake accounts and pages on Facebook Inc (FB.O) to promote state propaganda and attack regional rivals, the social media giant said on Thursday.
Facebook said it had suspended more than 350 accounts and pages with about 1.4 million followers, the latest takedown in an ongoing effort to combat “coordinated inauthentic behavior” on its platform, and the first such activity it has linked to the Saudi government.
“The government of Saudi Arabia has no knowledge of the mentioned accounts and does not know on what basis they were linked to it,” the Center for International Communication, the government’s media office, said in a statement sent to Reuters.
Countries in the Middle East have increasingly turned to websites such as Facebook, Twitter (TWTR.N) and Google’s (GOOGL.O) YouTube to peddle covert political influence online.
Reuters detailed an expansive Iranian-backed campaign last year and Riyadh has been accused of using the same tactics to attack regional rival Qatar and spread disinformation following the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Saudi Arabia has repeatedly denied any involvement in Khashoggi’s death. Along with allies, it maintains a trade and diplomatic boycott of Qatar, accusing it of terrorism which Qatar denies.
Facebook announces takedowns of “inauthentic behavior” as often as multiple times a month, but statements that directly link such behavior to a government are rare.
“For this operation, our investigators were able to confirm that the individuals behind this are associated with the government of Saudi Arabia,” said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy.
“Anytime we have a link between an information operation and a government, that’s significant and people should be aware.”
Facebook also said on Thursday it had suspended a separate network of more than 350 accounts linked to marketing firms in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. In that case it did not directly link the activity to a government.
“WOUNDED SOLDIER”
Gleicher said the Saudi campaign operated on Facebook and its Instagram photo-sharing platform, primarily targeting countries in the Middle East and North Africa, including Qatar, the UAE, Egypt Palestine.
The operation used fake accounts posing as those countries’ citizens and pages designed to look like local news outlets. More than $100,000 was spent on advertisements, Facebook said.
“They would typically post in Arabic about regional news and political issues. They would talk about things like Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - his internal and economic social reform plan, the successes of the Saudi armed forces, particularly during the conflict in Yemen,” said Gleicher.
Andy Carvin, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensics Lab, which worked with Facebook to analyze the Saudi campaign, said some of the accounts dated back to early 2014 but the majority had been created in the last two years.
More than 90% of the content was in Arabic, Carvin said, with some of the accounts “essentially operating as fan pages for the Saudi government and military.”
A copy of one of the Saudi posts released by Facebook on Thursday showed the crown prince kissing the bandaged head of a patient in a hospital bed. The Arabic caption reads: “His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman kisses the head of a wounded soldier.”
ONLINE BATTLEGROUND
Social media companies are under mounting pressure to help stop illicit political influence online.
U.S. intelligence officials have said that Russia used Facebook and other platforms to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and are concerned it will do so again in 2020. Moscow denies such allegations.
The Atlantic Council’s Ben Nimmo said online information operations were becoming increasingly visible as more governments and political groups adopt the tactics and the social media companies step up efforts to take them down.
Facebook has made at least 14 public announcements about takedowns of “inauthentic behavior” stemming from 17 different countries this year. The most recent announcement before Thursday included accounts run by people in Thailand, Russia, Ukraine and Honduras.
The network based in the UAE and Egypt that was also dismantled on Thursday was separate from the Saudi campaign, Facebook said, although it targeted some of the same countries in the Middle East and Africa with messages promoting the UAE.
“This shows how much social media has become a battleground, particularly in the Gulf, where you’ve got very strong regional rivalries and you’ve got a long tradition of working through proxies,” Nimmo said.
“This is almost becoming normalized,” he added. “Where you get geopolitical tensions, you get stuff like this going on, and we’re moving into a space where the platforms are dealing with this almost as routine.”  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-02-19/news_big_images/503356_98082879.jpg,Technology,"“Anytime we have a link between an information operation and a government, that’s significant and people should be aware.”

How 'tickling' the ear could prevent age related disease,"
Islamabad (Online): New research suggests that using controlled electric currents to stimulate certain parts of the ear could readjust the body’s metabolic balance, thus reducing the risk of age related health problems.
Vagus nerve stimulation is a practice that has lately gained a lot of attention from medical researchers.
The vagus nerve is the longest of the nerves that connect the brain with other parts of the body. It provides a direct link between the brain and the gut, and it also interacts with the parasympathetic nervous system.
The parasympathetic nervous system and the sympathetic nervous system together make up the autonomic nervous system, which regulates automatic bodily functions, such as breathing and heart rate.

For these reasons, researchers have looked into using vagus nerve stimulation to support health by reducing inflammation, improving blood pressure, and even fighting anxiety.

Vagus nerve stimulation often requires surgical intervention, in which doctors implant small electrodes in different regions of the body — usually the neck — so that they can deliver the electric stimuli.

However, one extension of the vagus nerve, which reaches some parts of the skin of the outer ear, is more accessible than the others. Doctors can stimulate this branch of the vagus nerve without the need for implants.

Recently, researchers from the Universities of Leeds and Glasgow — both in the United Kingdom — decided to find out whether they could improve autonomic nervous system activity by ""tickling"" those parts of the ear with small waves of electric current.

""The ear is like a gateway through which we can tinker with the body’s metabolic balance, without the need for medication or invasive procedures,"" says lead author Beatrice Bretherton, Ph.D.

The researchers hypothesized that rebalancing autonomic nervous system activity could boost general health and well-being. They also believed that it might prevent the development of certain age related conditions, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and atrial fibrillation.

2-week therapy improves sleep and mood

The researchers developed a therapy that they call ""transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation,"" which works by delivering small electrical stimuli to the vagus nerve through its branch in the outer ear skin.

In their study paper — which appears in the journal Aging — the investigators explain that as an individual ages, their parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems become imbalanced, with one starting to be more active than the other. This imbalance, they say, contributes to a greater vulnerability to health problems later in life.

The current research involved three different studies, all of which recruited participants aged 55 years and above who had no hypertension (high blood pressure), heart disease, diabetes, or epilepsy at baseline. In the first study, a group of 14 participants received one session of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation and one session of simulated nerve stimulation.

For the second study, the researchers worked with 51 participants who agreed to undertake only one session of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation. Finally, in the third study, 29 participants received vagus nerve stimulation daily for 2 weeks.

The first two studies allowed the researchers to define response rates in participants, giving them a more in-depth look at how vagus nerve stimulation via the ear would affect health.

The team found that the 2-week therapy helped boost parasympathetic nervous system activity while reducing sympathetic nervous system activity, thus improving the balance of autonomic nervous system function.

Some of the study participants also reported improvements in their sleep, mood, and overall quality of life.

""We believe these results are just the tip of the iceberg,"" notes Bretherton, adding, ""We are excited to investigate further into the effects and potential long-term benefits of daily ear stimulation, as we have seen a great response to the treatment so far.""

Therapy may ‘make a big difference’

The team adds that improving autonomic nervous system balance could even help lower mortality risk and may reduce the need for drugs or medical care because it lowers a person’s chance of developing age related diseases.

Moreover, the researchers observed that the participants who had the greatest autonomic nervous system imbalance at baseline benefited the most from the ear ""tickling"" therapy, as they saw the most significant improvements in well-being.

The next steps from here, the team says, are to find out which people are most likely to benefit from transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation and to see how this form of therapy might improve different aspects of health later in life.

""We believe this stimulation can make a big difference to people’s lives, and we’re now hoping to conduct further studies to see if [transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation] can benefit multiple disorders.""-Co-senior author Susan Deuchars, Ph.D. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-01-19/news_big_images/503203_63933949.jpg,Technology,"The first two studies allowed the researchers to define response rates in participants, giving them a more in-depth look at how vagus nerve stimulation via the ear would affect health.",neutral

Huawei still number two smartphone seller despite US sanctions ,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - Huawei remained the number two global smartphone vendor in the past quarter despite tough US sanctions imposed on the Chinese technology giant, market trackers said Wednesday.
The Chinese firm managed to boost its sales even as the overall market declined, remaining on the heels of sector leader Samsung and ahead of US-based Apple.
According to Strategy Analytics, overall global smartphone sales fell 2.6 percent to 341 million units in the April-June period.
Samsung increased its market share to 22 percent, helped by a seven percent rise in handset sales, mainly in the mid-range and entry segments. The South Korean giant stayed ahead of Huawei at 17 percent, and Apple at 11 percent of the market.
""Huawei surprised everyone and grew its global smartphone shipments by eight percent annually,"" said Strategy Analytics executive director Neil Mawston.
""Huawei surged at home in China during the quarter, as the firm sought to offset regulatory uncertainty in other major regions such as North America and Western Europe.""
The research firm estimated that Apple, which released its results this week without details on unit shipments, saw an eight percent drop in iPhone sales in the quarter.
""Apple is stabilizing in China due to price adjustments and buoyant trade-ins, but other major markets such as India and Europe remain challenging for the expensive iPhone,"" said Woody Oh, director at Strategy Analytics.
A separate report by Counterpoint Research offered similar findings, showing Samsung, Huawei and Apple in the three top spots as overall sales fell.
Analyst Tarun Pathak at Counterpoint said however the US ban on technology sales to Huawei will have an impact in the coming months.
""The effect of the ban did not translate into falling shipments during this quarter, which will not be the case in the future,"" Pathak said.
Anthony Scarsella of the research firm IDC, which also issued similar findings, said the market is seeing signs of stabilizing.
""A key driver in the second quarter was the availability of vastly improved mid-tier devices that offer premium designs and features while significantly undercutting the ultra-high-end in price,"" Scarsella said.
""Combine this with intensified and generous trade-in programs across major markets and channels, and upgrading now makes more sense to consumers.""
The surveys indicated Chinese makers Xiaomi and Oppo holding the fourth and fifth spots, largely due to sales in their home markets.
According to Counterpoint, the combined global smartphone market share of Chinese majors Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and Realme reached 42 percent, the highest it has ever been.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-01-19/news_big_images/503190_26856690.jpg,Technology,"The Chinese firm managed to boost its sales even as the overall market declined, remaining on the heels of sector leader Samsung and ahead of US-based Apple.",neutral

LightSail 2 successfully propels itself using only sunbeams,"
(Web Desk) – Back in 1976, the late Carl Sagan sat down on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson to talk about a new form of space propulsion called solar sailing. Four decades later, and The Planetary Society has officially demonstrated this ""tremendously exciting prospect"" in practice.
Drawing on ten years of hard work and 7 million dollars in crowdfunding, the nonprofit Society’s LightSail 2 has become the first small spacecraft to raise its orbit solely on the power of sunlight.
""We’re thrilled to announce mission success for LightSail 2,"" says Bruce Betts, LightSail program manager and the Society’s chief scientist.
""Our criteria was to demonstrate controlled solar sailing in a CubeSat by changing the spacecraft’s orbit using only the light pressure of the Sun, something that’s never been done before.""
The LightSail 2 spacecraft has been up in orbit for over a month, and last week, it opened its sails for the first time. In the eight days or so since, the spacecraft has raised its orbit by 1.7 kilometres, pushed along solely by the Sun’s photons, which ‘bounce off’ its reflective sails.
Following Japan’s IKAROS solar sail, which was launched in 2010, LightSail 2 is only the second-ever successful attempt at solar flying. Yet unlike IKAROS, it can use this new form of propulsion to actually change its orbit.
According to project manager Dave Spencer, LightSail 2 is being controlled autonomously by an on-board algorithm. By twisting the spacecraft 90 degrees every 50 minutes, this software can alter the craft’s orientation, so that it gets enough energy from the Sun no matter where it is. IKAROS, in comparison, could only turn about four or five degrees.
This impressive algorithm is still being updated and tweaked. One of the biggest challenges so far has been refining the spacecraft’s momentum, which is controlled by a spinning wheel.
This momentum wheel is used to change the craft’s orientation so that it turns the thrust from solar sailing on and off.
When the wheel starts approaching maximum speed, which it does a couple times per day, it needs to be slowed down.
This is currently done using electromagnetic torque rods, which orient the spacecraft using Earth’s magnetic field.
Unfortunately, this temporarily takes the spacecraft out of its proper orientation for solar sailing, so scientists are still trying to figure out how to reduce these saturation points as much as possible. A software patch for this very issue was uploaded today.
""We are learning a lot from LightSail 2 right now,"" said Bill Nye, the CEO of The Planetary Society, during a recent press conference.
""In other words, although we’ve declared mission success, and we did this thing that we have been hoping to do for - depending on how you reckon - 42 years, LightSail 2 will fly for almost another year... We are going to learn a lot about controlling the spacecraft and the performance of the sails in the next few months.""
It’s hard to predict exactly how much further the spacecraft will be able to raise its orbit. Prelaunch simulations predicted that as solar propulsion adds up, it would increase the craft’s orbit by about half a kilometre per day.
In the end, this wasn’t too far off the mark; in fact, the spacecraft increased by around 900 metres (2,950 ft) just the other day.
But just as there’s a lower limit to the spacecraft’s orbit, there’s also an upper limit.
""The atmospheric density at those altitudes is really poorly modelled and highly variable, and so we don’t really know at what point atmospheric drag is going to overcome our ability to continue orbit raising,"" explained Spencer in the press briefing.
""So we’ll keep doing this as long as we can.""
The applications for this technology are limitless, and scientists have proposed using it in the search for alien life, monitoring weather on the Sun and as a warning system for incoming asteroids.
There’s even a dream that if a material can be found that tolerates high heat and radiation, a solar-sailing spacecraft could creep really close to the Sun, receiving a huge thrust that would ultimately allow it to travel much farther and at much higher speeds.
""This technology enables us to take things to extraordinary destinations in the Solar System and maybe even beyond, in a way that was never possible before,"" Nye said in the briefing, ""because you don’t need fuel, you don’t need all the systems to control fuel, manage fuel and buy fuel.""
NASA’s Near-Earth Asteroid Scout, which is set to launch sometime in mid 2020, is probably the earliest application for this new technology. The bold mission plans to use a solar sail and a 6U CubeSat, or miniaturised spacecraft, to gather data on nearby asteroids that hold potential for future human missions.
""Some of the very early concepts for solar sailing missions had large spacecrafts and enormous sails,"" Spencer explained in the briefing.
""But what’s really interesting is that in the last decade or so, it’s been the CubeSat revolution where the technology has gotten so small that has allowed solar sailing to really take the forefront and be developed as a source of in space propulsion for these tiny spacecraft.""

Scientists find 'super-earth' that may be habitable ,"
(Web Desk ) – Just 31 light-years away, one of the closest worlds ever detected could harbour liquid water on its surface.
NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS – a super-powerful orbiting telescope that scouts the sky for alien worlds – spotted a new planet circling a nearby star in the Hydra constellation. When astronomers checked the star for confirmation, they discovered two more worlds orbiting it.
One of those planets, called GJ 357 d, could support liquid water if it turns out to have a thick atmosphere and be made of rock.
It’s among the 45 closest exoplanets confirmed to date, out of a total 4,025 planets tallied so far outside our solar system.
This planet system is the third-closest identified using the ""transit"" method, in which telescopes watch for tiny dips in a star’s brightness that could be caused by a planet passing in front of it. The Kepler telescope pioneered the technique, though it’s been refined by TESS.

The promising planet is in its star’s ""habitable zone"", the range of distances in which a rocky world could have the right surface temperature for liquid water to exist.
""GJ 357 d is located within the outer edge of its star’s habitable zone, where it receives about the same amount of stellar energy from its star as Mars does from the Sun,"" Diana Kossakowski, a member of the team that discovered the planet, said in a press release.
""If the planet has a dense atmosphere, which will take future studies to determine, it could trap enough heat to warm the planet and allow liquid water on its surface,"" Kossakowski said.
If the planet turns out to have no atmosphere, however, its surface would be about -64 degrees Fahrenheit (-53 degrees Celsius), well below water’s freezing point.
GJ 357 d’s mass is at least 6.1 times Earth’s, and the planet orbits its tiny star every 55.7 days. Scientists can’t say much about else about it without further study though.

TESS is only halfway done

TESS, NASA’s most powerful planet-hunting telescope ever, watches thousands of stars for transits.
The telescope observes one section of the sky for 27 days at a time, before moving on to a new patch. It divides each half of the sky (the northern half and the southern half) into 13 patches, as shown in the NASA graphic below. The spacecraft completed the southern half of its journey this month and turned to the northern sky.
When the mission ends around this time next year, TESS will have observed over 85 percent of the sky.
So far, the telescope has found over 850 potential new planets. The next step is for ground-based telescopes to examine the stars that these planets might be orbiting and detect whether the planets indeed exert a gravitational pull.
That process is what enabled researchers to find GJ 357 d. As they were working to confirm the planet that TESS spotted, they noticed gravitational pulls from two others. (TESS didn’t spot those two worlds because their orbits don’t pass between their star and the telescope.)

So far, only 24 of the exoplanets that TESS has spotted have been confirmed. Earlier this week, astronomers confirmed three nearby planets the telescope detected, including a ""super-Earth,"" though none is thought to have liquid water.
Scientists expect the telescope to identify thousands of exoplanet candidates before the mission ends. Some of those could be habitable, including GJ 357 d.
""The team is currently focused on finding the best candidates to confirm by ground-based follow-up,"" Natalia Guerrero, who manages the MIT team that identifies exoplanet candidates, said in a NASA press release last week.
""But there are many more potential exoplanet candidates in the data yet to be analysed, so we’re really just seeing the tip of the iceberg here.""

Facebook removes profile frame targeting Pakistan's Ahmadi community,"
ISLAMABAD (AFP) - Facebook said Wednesday it has removed a profile frame targeting Pakistan‘s Ahmadi community as the media giant continues to grapple with the proliferation of hate speech on the social network.
Profile frames are filters Facebook users can add to their pictures that often promote a cause, celebrate a holiday, or commemorate an event or tragedy.
The frame withdrawn by Facebook called for the death of the Ahmadis in Urdu and was widely shared in Pakistan.
""We have removed the Profile Frames in question for violating our rules, and have ensured that they are unavailable for future use,"" a Facebook spokesperson told AFP via email.
""We do not tolerate any content -- including anything shared within Profile Frames -- that incites violence, and we remove this content whenever we become aware of it.""
The frame was extensively used by Facebook users after US President Donald Trump met with several leading members of persecuted religious groups in the White House earlier this month, including a representative from Pakistan‘s Ahmadi community.
Facebook disabled 2.19 billion accounts in the first quarter of this year, nearly double the number of accounts nixed in the prior three-month period.
The social network took down four million posts considered hate speech in the first quarter of this year and continues to invest in technology to better detect such material in various languages and regions.
However Facebook has been battered by criticism that it was more focused on growth than protecting users or thwarting deception, bullying, and harassment. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-31-19/news_big_images/503061_60014517.jpg,Technology,The social network took down four million posts considered hate speech in the first quarter of this year and continues to invest in technology to better detect such material in various languages and regions.,neutral

Impaired patient plays video game using brain signals,"
ZURICH (Reuters) - Scientists in Switzerland have developed a system which allows people with severely-impaired motor functions, such as quadriplegia, to use video games using only the power of their brain.
Samuel Kunz, who was paralysed after an accident, uses the brain-computer interface to control an avatar through a race course in a specially-designed computer game called ‘Brain Driver’. The ultimate aim of the research is to develop technology to control devices such as wheelchairs for those with a limited ability to move.
Kunz, who is taking part in the trial, is able to ‘pilot’ the digital race-car using only his brain signals transmitted to a computer via electrodes placed on his head.

""These electrodes are connected to an amplifier and then to the computer and to our algorithms in the end. The algorithms are then calculating the brain signal and sending commands to the game that our pilot can actually control,"" Dr. Rea Lehner, a neuroscientist at ETH Zurich explained.
Lehner added Kunz is training his mind by imagining certain actions which are then translated into signals to control the race car. Thinking about moving his left hand makes the car turn left, thinking about moving his right hand turns the car right, and moving both together makes the car go straight. A fourth command - fully relaxing and clearing his mind - slows the car down.
Kunz said it has taken a lot of practise to train his mind to control the game; which will be made even more difficult in a stadium full of people. He will be among those taking part in a special championship next year called Cybathlon in which people with physical disabilities compete against each other using state-of-the-art technology.
""I have to be very concentrated. The connection between my fingers and my brain is not there anymore. I still try to move my fingers just in my head and so that needs a lot of concentration to do it exactly the same way every time,"" Kunz told Reuters during a training session in Zurich.
In the Cybathlon ‘Brain Driver’ event, four participants will compete in a race and will be able to see the position of their avatar and the competing avatars. The first participant to cross the finish line wins the race, with a time limit of four minutes. The inaugural Cybathlon was held in Zurich in 2016, with the next event scheduled for 2020.
ETH Zurich’s professor for neural control of movement, Nicole Wenderoth, explained that their biggest challenge is decoding the complex brain signals using non-invasive sensors. But, she said, the next generation of technology will probably mean sensors and electrodes implanted directly into the brain.
In a separate development in the field, Elon Musk’s start-up Neuralink is aiming to connect the human brain with a machine interface ""before the end of next year"", the CEO announced in July.
Speaking in San Francisco on July 16, Musk presented ""version one"" of his neuron-sized threads and microprocessor chips that he claims will help people with severe brain injuries and eventually allow humans to connect with advancing artificial intelligence (A.I.) technology. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-31-19/news_big_images/503041_72163718.jpg,Technology,"Speaking in San Francisco on July 16, Musk presented ""version one"" of his neuron-sized threads and microprocessor chips that he claims will help people with severe brain injuries and eventually allow humans to connect with advancing artificial intelligence (A.I.)",neutral

Apple's quarterly profit falls as iPhone sales sputter,"
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple’s iPhone sales are still sputtering while the company tries to offset the decline by milking more money from digital services such as music.
The latest evidence of the iPhone’s waning popularity had been expected. Even so, the confirmation in Tuesday’s fiscal third-quarter earnings report underscored the challenges facing a company that has been riding the smartphone revolution for the past decade.
The iPhone’s downturn is the main reason Apple’s profit for the April-June period fell 13% to $10 billion.
The good news is Apple has several ways it can still make money from the 900 million iPhones in use today. Besides selling new models to current iPhone owners after the current devices eventually wear out, Apple has positioned itself to make billions of dollars more from music, video and gaming subscriptions, maintenance plans and commissions from apps selling their own wares on iPhones.
The bad news is that Apple has still been relying on the iPhone for more than half its revenue so this year, and the company hasn’t proven it can be as adept peddling digital services as it has been making sleek devices. For instance, Apple’s 4-year old music streaming service still lags Spotify. Apple is preparing to launch a video streaming service more than a decade after Netflix pioneered the concept.
And a recently opened U.S. Justice Department investigation is expected to look into whether Apple unfairly favors its own services and gouges others through its app store, raising the specter of changes that could further depress its revenue.
“Apple has become a victim of its own success and there also appears to be a lack of urgency,” Chatham Road Partners analyst Colin Gillis said. “Apple is still the iPhone company and it may always end up being the iPhone company.”
The lingering doubts hanging over Apple are one reason why Apple’s stock price remains well below its peak of $233.47 reached last October, even as the rest of the market has soared to record highs. The company’s shares gained 4% to $217.55 in extended trading after the release of its numbers for the April-June period.
The rally may have stemmed from another encouraging sign that emerged in the quarterly report. Apple’s total sales in China decreased by 4% in the quarter compared with a year ago, after plunging 25% during the first half of the company’s fiscal year. That dramatic improvement eased fears that the Trump administration’s trade war in China might trigger a consumer boycott of Apple’s products in the country in retaliation.
“We couldn’t be happier with the progress,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a Tuesday conference call. He credited both Apple’s own price cuts and economic stimulus programs rolled out by China’s government to counteract the effects of U.S. tariffs.
Worldwide revenue from iPhones during the quarter totaled $26 billion, a 12% decrease from the same time last year. It marks the third straight quarter of eroding iPhone sales, something that has only happened once before.
Apple is forecasting its total revenue for the July-September period will fall from last year, a sign that it is bracing for yet another drop in iPhone sales. That’s particularly striking because Apple typically gets a big boost from the release of new iPhone models in late September. But the mid-range projection of $62.5 billion of revenue for the period was better than the $60.9 billion anticipated by analysts, providing another sign of hope for investors betting on Apple’s resilience.
Even with the iPhone in decline, Apple remains a financial powerhouse. Total revenue grew 1% from last year to $53.9 billion.
The services division remains the biggest area of growth, with revenue surging 13% from last year to $11.5 billion in the past quarter. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-31-19/news_big_images/503035_29142713.jpg,Technology,"“Apple is still the iPhone company and it may always end up being the iPhone company.”

Chinese solar-powered unmanned aircraft makes maiden flight,"
BEIJING (Dunya News) – After two years of research and development, the Chinese solar-powered unmanned aircraft ""MOZI 2"" with independent intellectual property rights, successfully made its maiden flight at Moganshan airport in Deqing, east China’s Zhejiang Province on July 27, according to its producer OXAI Aircraft Co., Ltd. on Tuesday.
According to the Shanghai-based company, the aircraft, designed with a wingspan of 15 meters and solely powered by solar cells, can fly at a maximum altitude of 8,000 meters. It can cruise at a low speed for up to 12 hours during the night after charging in the sunlight for eight hours.

The aircraft is expected to be used for disaster relief, reconnaissance and communication.
Mao Yiqing, the company’s general manager, said they would work with 5G service providers to further expand the application of the aircraft.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-31-19/news_big_images/502987_24888702.jpg,Technology,"

Tesla advances towards storing renewable energy,"
(Web Desk) – Tesla on Monday announced its largest battery product. Called Megapack, it’s designed to simplify the installation process for large energy-storage projects.
Each Megapack can store up to 3 megawatt hours of energy and convert up to 1.5 megawatts of energy from a direct current (DC) to an alternating current (AC) so homes can use it.
Tesla had previously used its industrial-size Powerpack batteries for large-scale projects, but says the Megapack has 60 percent more energy density.
A system of Megapacks is more cost-effective and can be installed faster than a fossil-fuel power plant, Tesla says, and the Megapacks can store energy generated by wind turbines or solar panels.
The electric-car and energy company will use Megapacks in a California installation operated by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and designed for use when demand for energy from local grids is greater than their supply.
""Battery storage is transforming the global electric grid and is an increasingly important element of the world’s transition to sustainable energy,"" Tesla said in a blog post on its website.
In 2017, Tesla used Powerpacks to install in Australia what it says is the world’s largest lithium-ion battery to support local energy grids. The project reduced costs by almost US$40 million during its first year, Tesla says.
Storage has come to account for an increasingly large percentage of Tesla’s energy business, which also includes solar panels. While solar installations have declined in recent years, installed storage-capacity has increased.

Mosquitoes carrying deadly brain virus found in Florida,"
(Web Desk) – Orange County, Florida, just released a public advisory warning that the Department of Health had found signs of the rare brain-infecting virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) in the area.
EEEV is a particularly rare infection - it tends to spread in remote, swampy areas far from human civilization. But when the disease does strike, it can be grave: Gizmodo reports that a bite from an infected mosquito can cause severe, fatal brain swelling in a matter of days.
Health Department officials found EEEV in a flock of sentinel chickens, which local governments use to monitor and track infectious diseases, according to the warning, which included a list of steps people can take to prevent mosquito populations from growing.
If the sentinel chickens are getting bit, that means human infections could follow close behind, according to Gizmodo.
Unfortunately, mosquito-borne illness will likely spread farther into human-populated areas as our planet continues to heat up through climate change.
While EEEV is rare and human infections that lead to dangerous symptoms are even rarer, scientists have yet to figure out a vaccine or treatment for the disease, posing a problem for our warmer future.

"Planetary Society expected to announce something ""major"" about solar sailing","
(Web Desk) – The Planetary Society has been busy recently. On June 25, its LightSail 2 launched into orbit; just last week on July 24, the craft opened its sails successfully, a key stage of its mission to demonstrate solar sailing in practice.
And now, the nonprofit foundation has released a statement, revealing that today (July 31), there is going to be a major announcement about LightSail 2; sounds like it could be something really exciting.
The small LightSail 2 spacecraft is a crowd-funded endeavour, built to demonstrate controlled solar sailing - a promising method of propulsion that doesn’t require fuel.
Instead, the craft hosts a large sail made out of a reflective material for photons emitted by the Sun to ‘bounce’ off of.

Although photons - light particles - don’t have mass, they do have momentum, and the hypothetical principles behind solar sails state that in the vacuum of space, even this small momentum can push the spacecraft forward.
So far, so good: LightSail 2 is currently drifting 720 km (420 miles) above Earth’s surface, and over the next month the craft is expected to adjust its elliptical orbit by using the solar sail.
This is already exciting, but tomorrow at 5 pm UTC we can expect to hear a potentially major announcement from Bill Nye, the CEO of The Planetary Society, as well as three other scientists working for the foundation.
So far, it’s anybody’s guess what that announcement might bring; we’ve already received some stunning pictures of the solar sail deploying, so it won’t be that.
They do tease that it’s a ‘major solar sailing milestone’, so if that checks out, it will be one for the history books.

Facebook fact-checker says company must share more data to fight misinformation,"
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - One of Facebook’s third-party fact-checking partners on Tuesday said the company needed to share more data with fact-checkers to better curb misinformation.
UK-based charity Full Fact, which joined the programme in January, issued a report urging Facebook to provide more data on how flagged content is shared over time, to see how quickly false information is spreading and assess how fact-checks are containing the spread.
The charity, which said it had earned $171,800 from fact-checking Facebook content between January and June, also raised concerns about the effectiveness of Facebook’s machine-learning approaches for identifying potentially false content.
Facebook launched the programme in December 2016 and now has 54 fact-checking partners working in 42 languages.
Under the system, fact-checking partners rate content with labels and Facebook then downgrades the distribution of certain items. Facebook also adds fact-checkers’ articles to a story’s “Related Articles” and notifies users if they try to share or have previously shared a false story.
Julia Bain of Facebook’s integrity partnerships team said the social media network was evolving its rating scale to account for different types of misinformation and working on improving the impact of fact-checks by identifying similar or identical content.
“We are encouraged that many of the recommendations in the report are being actively pursued by our teams,” Bain said in a statement to Reuters.
Although Full Fact said it still thought the programme was worthwhile, it echoed statements from other partners that Facebook was not sharing enough data that they could use to evaluate their fact-checks.
Eugene Kiely, director of FactCheck.org, recently told Reuters that he “couldn’t make heads or tails” of a report the organisation received last December.
“We haven’t really received anything from Facebook that would provide evidence one way or the other to the effectiveness,” he added.
A Facebook spokeswoman told Reuters that fact-checking partners receive quarterly reports.
Full Fact also called for the programme to be expanded to Instagram, so that fact-checkers could directly check content on the platform. In May, the company started using image-detection to find content debunked on Facebook and removing it from Instagram’s Explore tab and hashtag search results.

"Huawei outsells smartphone rivals in China, tightens market grip amid US spat","
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China’s Huawei Technologies cemented its dominance of the domestic smartphone market in the second quarter, with shipments and market share rising, as Chinese customers backed the embattled firm amid its trade fight with the United States.
Huawei, which was put on a trade blacklist by the United States since mid-May and was virtually barred from doing business there even earlier, shipped 37.3 million smartphones in China in the three months ended June, up 31% year-on-year, according to market research firm Canalys.
Its market share rose more than 10 percentage points to 38% in the quarter, even as all other top vendors lost ground in the world’s biggest smartphone market, the Canalys data showed.
Huawei was added by Washington to a so-called Entity List in May. The blacklisting has threatened to cut its access to essential U.S. components and software such as the Google Android apps.
The addition to the list “caused uncertainty overseas” but the firm has been shifting its focus towards its home market, where it invested in an aggressive offline expansion to lure consumers with a patriotic sales pitch, said Canalys analyst Mo Jia.
Calls to support Huawei have consistently surfaced on Chinese social media on comment threads trailing news on the company.
Kitty Fok, who tracks China’s smartphone sector at research firm IDC, said that consumers responded to the spat over Huawei with pro-China sentiment, which helped boost the brand’s already-strong appeal in the country.
“The product itself is already well-recognised, and the trade war helped people feel like they need to support Huawei. The only worry was that they might not get the component supply, but in the end, they did,” said Fok.
Huawei’s second-quarter smartphone shipments surged even as overall Chinese smartphone shipments shrank. Smartphone shipments in China declined by 6% in the quarter to 97.6 million units, the 9th consecutive quarterly fall, according to Canalys.
Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi Corp and Apple Inc, the top four vendors behind Huawei, saw declines in shipments and market share in the quarter, Canalys said.
The second-quarter China shipments represented 64% of Huawei’s total smartphone shipments in the quarter, it said.
“Clearly the international market is a risky one now, whereas in China, where the Android ecosystem is most mature, in terms of sales channels and software income, Huawei has clear advantage in price negotiation,” said Canalys analyst Jia. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-30-19/news_big_images/502862_80016861.jpg,Technology,"

EU court rules sites must warn about Facebook 'like' button,"
LUXEMBOURG (AFP) - Europe’s top court ruled Monday that online retailers must warn web users that they send personal data to Facebook through the ""like"" button.
According to the European Court of Justice ruling, a site that embeds the Facebook ""like"" icon and link on its pages also sends user data to the US web giant.
""It seems that that transmission occurs without that visitor being aware of it and regardless of whether or not he or she is a member of the social network Facebook or has clicked on the ‘Like’ button,"" it said.
Under EU data protection law, therefore, a European retailer and the US platform are jointly responsible for gathering the data and sending it to Facebook’s Irish subsidiary.
Users should therefore be warned and asked to consent to their data being gathered, although the retailer is not responsible for what Facebook does with it later.
""As a result of this case, companies that embed this ‘like’ button on their website cannot hide behind Facebook any longer,"" said Monique Goyens, of the European Consumer Organisation.
""The decision therefore underlines the right for internet users to always get information on what data are collected and how they are used by websites,"" she said.
The case was brought by a German consumer protection agency against online clothes site Fashion ID, which embeds a Facebook button to encourage shoppers to publicise its wares.
Bitkom, a German trade federation for online businesses criticised the ruling, saying it would heap costly bureaucracy on firms without enhancing consumer protection.
""With its decision, the ECJ places enormous responsibility on thousands of website operators -- from small travel blogs to online megastores and the portals of large publishers,"" Bitkom CEA Bernard Rohleder said.
He warned that the decision would go beyond Facebook and effect all social media plug ins, which are important for many firms",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-30-19/news_big_images/502768_17372964.jpg,Technology,"

Google builds gesture controls into new Pixel phone,"
SAN FRANCISCO (AFP) - Google on Monday revealed that it is building gesture controls and face recognition into a next-generation Pixel smartphone as it looks to fuel early enthusiasm for its upcoming flagship handset.
The Pixel 4 is expected to make its debut in October, along with a new iPhone as competitors strive to win or keep fans in the competitive, cooling smartphone market.
The two new Pixel features teased by Google were billed as representing a ""next step"" in the internet giant’s vision for a future in which computing power is available anywhere when people want without having to think about it.
Alphabet-owned Google said the key technology would center around its motion-sensing radar called ""Soli.""
""Pixel 4 will be the first device with Soli, powering our new motion sense features to allow you to skip songs, snooze alarms, and silence phone calls, just by waving your hand,"" Pixel product manager Brandon Barbello said in an online post.
""These capabilities are just the start, and just as Pixels get better over time, motion sense will evolve as well.""
Google’s advanced technology and projects team has worked on Soli, a motion-sending radar, for the past five years, according to Barbello.
Along with recognizing hand gestures, Soli will cue facial recognition sensors when a Pixel 4 is picked up to allow devices to automatically unlock for their owners.
""Face unlock uses facial recognition technology that is processed on your device, so that image data never leaves your phone,"" Barbello said.
""The images used for face unlock are never saved or shared with other Google services.""
Soli sensor data is also kept on smartphones and not shared with other Google services, according to Barbello.
Google, Apple and other smartphone rivals typically launch new premium models ahead of the year-end holiday shopping season. A Samsung event in early August is expected to reveal its new Note handset.

Riskiest time for surgery patients is not in the operating room,"
(Reuters Health) - The deadliest time for many surgery patients isn’t when they’re on the operating table, it’s while they’re recovering in the hospital and after they go home, a new study suggests.
For the study, researchers examined outcomes for more than 40,000 patients 45 and older who underwent non-cardiac surgery at 28 hospitals in 14 countries. Researchers monitored patients for complications and deaths within 30 days of surgery.
Overall, five people, or less than 1% of patients, died in the operating table, and another 500 patients, or 70%, died in the hospital. Another 210 deaths, or 29%, didn’t happen until after patients were sent home.
Nearly half of all the deaths were associated with three complications: major bleeding, heart damage, and bloodstream infections.
“Many families anxiously wait to hear from the surgeon whether their loved one survived the operation, but our research demonstrates that very few of the deaths occur in the operating room,” said Dr. P.J. Devereaux, senior author of the study and director of the Division of Perioperative Care at McMaster University in Canada.
“Our research now demonstrates that there is a need to focus on postoperative care and transitional care into the home setting to improve outcomes,” Devereaux said by email.
Worldwide, 100 million patients age 45 and older undergo inpatient surgery unrelated to cardiac issues every year, researchers note in CMAJ.
A wide range of technological and medical advances have made surgery safer and less invasive in recent years, the study team notes. But at the same time, patients also are coming to the hospital sicker and being sent home with complex care needs that once would have meant a lengthy hospital stay.
In the study, roughly half of the patients had high blood pressure, one in five had diabetes, and 13% had coronary artery disease.
More than one-third of them came in only for low-risk procedures that were not emergencies. Many of the rest had major general, orthopedic, urological, gynecological, vascular or neurological operations.
Patients who experienced major bleeding after surgery were more than twice as likely to die within 30 days as people who didn’t have this complication.
And patients who developed heart injuries even though they didn’t have heart surgery were also more than twice as likely to die.
Patients who got sepsis, a serious bloodstream infection, were more than five times more likely to die within 30 days than people who didn’t get these infections.
The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to identify which if any complications actually caused any deaths.
Inflammation may be a common denominator in the complications that were most responsible for deaths, said Barnaby Charles Reeves of the University of Bristol in the U.K., author of an editorial accompanying the study.
“Surgery causes a body-wide inflammatory reaction,” Reeves said by email. “This can lead to single or multi-organ failure (kidney, heart, lungs, sepsis etc.) which leads to death.”
Patients may also not recognize that something is wrong when they’re coming off anesthesia or taking narcotic painkillers after surgery, Devereaux said.
“This makes patients after surgery vulnerable to delays in recognizing complications and hence delays in treatment,” Devereaux said.
Surgery also activates patients’ inflammatory, stress, and coagulation systems. The activation of these systems can also predispose patients to major complications. Patients should advocate and support research into enhanced monitoring techniques after surgery, which can help sort out identifying ways to lower the risk of death after surgery.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-30-19/news_big_images/502760_13914664.jpg,Technology,And patients who developed heart injuries even though they didn’t have heart surgery were also more than twice as likely to die.,neutral
