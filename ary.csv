"NAB appeals for cancellation of bails: SC puts Shehbaz, Fawad on notice","
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Thursday issued notices to Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif andformer principal secretary to the prime minister Fawad Hassan Fawad on appeals of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) seeking cancellation of their bails.

NAB’s lawyer Naeem Bukhari contended before the court that the Lahore High Court (LHC) granted bail to the accused in violation of the principles laid down by the top court.

 Justice Ijazul Ahsan, a member of the bench, remarked the high court rejected NAB’s charges against the accused in its ruling on their bail petitions and held that the contracts in the Ashiana Housing Scheme were awarded on merit.

Lebanon eyes austerity package to slash deficit,"
BEIRUT: Lebanon is set to impose austerity measures to combat its bulging fiscal deficit, Prime Minister Saad Hariri said on Wed­nesday, warning of an economic “catastrophe” if public spending keeps rising.
“As a government, we are required to issue the most austere budget in Lebanon’s history because our financial position doesn’t allow us to increase spending,” Hariri told reporters after a session of parliament.
“If we continue like this we will reach a catastrophe,” he said, one-year after his government committed to slashing public spending in order to unlock billions in aid pledged by international donors.

 Hariri did not specify what measures his government was mulling but hinted the package may include wage cuts for soldiers.Lebanon is one of the world’s most indebted countries, with public debt estimated at 141 percent of gross domestic product in 2018, according to credit ratings agency Moody’s.
The budget for 2019 has yet to be finalised, but public sector workers fear that austerity measures may mean cuts to their salaries.
Hundreds of civil servants protested in central Beirut to denounce any such move.
The demonstrations came as part of a nationwide public sector strike that affected schools, universities, state-run media outlets and the tourism ministry’s offices.
Lebanese Foreign Minis­ter Gebran Bassil on Satur­day proposed to reduce public sector wages, warning that “there will be no salaries for anyone” otherwise.

Modi’s party fields candidate accused in bomb blast,"
The ruling party of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Wednesday it will field a candidate accused of involvement in a deadly 2008 bomb blast in the country’s ongoing national election.
Pragya Singh Thakur, a 48-year-old female monk, is out on bail while she faces charges related to the attackthat killed six people.
She announced on Wednesday that she will run for a seat in the city of Bhopal on the ticket of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

 Thakur, a firebrand speaker, made national headlines after the blast close to a mosque in western Maharashtra state’s Malegaon city that also injured around 100 people.
She was arrested shortly after the attack and was described by authorities as a leading plotter. Indian law allows candidates facing court cases to run up until the time of any conviction.
“All conspiracies against me have failed. I am an ascetic monk and will ensure justice and respect for my country,” Thakur said, clad in traditional Hindu saffron clothes, at a press conference in Bhopal.
“I am confident, fully confident. I am ready for politics and (this) religious war,” she added, flanked by regional party leaders.
Thakur was released on bail in 2017 and has had one charge against her dropped but still faces other charges in the ongoing trial.
Her candidacy in Bhopal — a BJP stronghold constituency in a key heartland state — is expected to polarise local voters.
Her main rival is the outspoken and controversial Digvijaya Singh, from the opposition Congress party.
Hindu nationalists accuse Singh of using the term “saffron terror”, which they view as objectionable, to refer to acts of violence by right-wing extremists targeting areas with large Muslim populations.
India’s election is taking place in seven phases, with voting in Bhopal not scheduled until May 12. Results in the vote, the world’s largest, are expected on May 23.
The election is seen as a referendum on Modi, who is seeking a second term from the country’s 900 million voters.
The opposition Congress party has tried to undermine support for Modi by pointing to his lacklustre economic performance in the last five years.
The BJP meanwhile has focus on Modi’s key social schemes and a hardline nationalist stance.

Sudan’s al-Bashir moved to prison as protesters rally,"
KHARTOUM: Sudan’s military rulers have transferred ousted president Omar al-Bashir to prison, a family source said Wednesday, as crowds of protesters flocked through Khartoum in vans and buses to join a sit-in at the army complex.
Following the dramatic end to Bashir’s rule of three decades last week, he was moved late Tuesday to Kober prison in the capital, the source said without revealing his name for security reasons.
Witnesses near the prison in north Khartoum said there was a heavy deployment of soldiers and members of a paramilitary group outside.

 The 75-year-old’s whereabouts have been unknown since a military takeover on Thursday when the country’s new rulers said he was being held “in a secure place”.
Late on Wednesday, the military council announced it had detained two of Bashir’s five brothers — Abdallah Hassan al-Bashir and Al-Abbas Hassan al-Bashir.
It said the council had also decided to integrate the Popular Defence Force into the army.
The PDF is a type of reserve unit frequently used to support units of the regular army.
Amnesty International called for Bashir to be “immediately handed over to the International Criminal Court” in The Hague where he faces charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity relating to the conflict in Darfur. He denies the charges.
“His case must not be hurriedly tried in Sudan’s notoriously dysfunctional legal system. Justice must be served,” said Amnesty’s Joan Nyanyuki.
Bashir’s detention has failed to pacify protesters, who launched anti-government demonstrations in December and have for days been camped out in front of Khartoum’s army headquarters.
Scores of doctors in white robes marched from Khartoum’s main hospital towards the sit-in, carrying banners and chanting: “freedom, peace, justice.”
Journalists held a separate rally, along with university students and scores of women from a Facebook group who call themselves “the Information Network of the Revolution”.
The women — who include doctors, lawyers and teachers — are renowned for monitoring security agents who target protesters and publishing their information online in order to hold them to account.
Tension at protest site
Later in the evening crowds of protesters flocked through Khartoum to join the sit-in chanting “revolution, revolution”, an AFP correspondent reported.
Sudan’s military rulers have made some concessions, including the sacking Tuesday of prosecutor general Omer Ahmed Mohamed, but demonstrators fear their uprising could be hijacked.
“We faced tear gas, many of us were jailed. We have been shot and many have died. All this because we said what we wanted to,” Fadia Khalaf told AFP.
Khalid Mohamed, a medic, said: “We got Bashir out, but we still have to get rid of the regime”.
Officials say at least 65 people have been killed in protest-related violence since December, with some of the dead memorialised in a Khartoum mural.
While there have been scenes of celebration — with demonstrators singing and waving their national flag — the protest site has grown tenser amid concerns the army will try to clear the sit-in with force.
“Now we fear that our revolution could be stolen, which is why we are keeping our ground here. We are staying here until our demands are met,” said Khalaf.
Earlier this week witnesses said several army vehicles had surrounded the area and that troops were removing the barricades which demonstrators had put up as a security measure.
On Wednesday thousands of protesters remained at the site, cheering each other on despite looking fatigued.
“I feel those people who are doing the sit-in are like my sons and daughters. I have suffered under this regime,” said a woman serving tea at a makeshift checkpoint set up by protesters.
On taking power the army said a military council would run Sudan for two years, sparking a backlash from protest leaders.
Just a day later former defence minister General Awad Ibn Ouf stepped down as council chief, sparking jubilation on Khartoum’s streets.
His successor General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan oversaw weekend talks with political parties, which failed to make headway.

Indians begin voting in second phase of mammoth general election,"
NEW DELHI: Voters across swaths of southern India began queueing up early on Thursday in the second phase of a mammoth, staggered general election in which opposition parties are trying to stop Prime Minister Narendra Modi from winning a second term.
More than 155 million people are eligible to vote in the second phase, which covers 95 parliament constituencies in 12 states including parts of restive Jammu and Kashmir. India’s parliament has 545 members.
The focus will be on the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, where the main opposition Congress party and its allies need to win big if they hope to oust Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

 “If the non-BJP parties perform well in these two states, then they would still be having a chance of forming a non-BJP government at the center,” said Sanjay Kumar, director of the Center for the Study of Developing Societies, a think tank based in the capital, New Delhi.
The election began last week and will end next month in a giant exercise involving almost 900 million people.
Votes will be counted on May 23 and the results are expected the same day.
The BJP began the election as the frontrunner, with Modi setting muscular national security as his campaign plank after a renewal of hostilities with neighboring Pakistan.

Can Cathedral Notre-Dame be restored in just five years?,"
French President Emmanuel Macron has promised to complete a painstaking renovation of Notre-Dame within five years after the historic cathedral suffered a monstrous fire that destroyed its spire and roof.
But will France be able to muster the necessary workers and materials to meet the challenge? While some experts say it’s possible, others are less sure, especially if officials want to stick as closely as possible to the original features of the 850-year-old gothic masterpiece.
What needs to be done?

 The cathedral’s floor is littered with charred debris that will require weeks, if not months, to clear.
Architects say that before any work can begin they must establish how solid the stone structure is since it might have been weakened by the fire’s extreme heat and water.
Culture Minister Franck Riester said Tuesday that two gables are at risk of falling, including one high above a row of apartment buildings just to the north of the church.
If it were to fall, “it could bring down the central gable that is between the two towers, the one you see when looking at Notre-Dame’s facade,” Riester said.
Once structural integrity is assured, workers can begin erecting a vast “umbrella” to keep rain from pouring into gaping holes, including one made by the spire’s collapse.
Renovation of the roof can then proceed – assuming officials have decided on aesthetic choices and materials.
“Five years isn’t much. Above all, it means three or four years of actual work, because first there’s the security phase of several months, and then six to seven months for diagnostics, if they deploy enough people,” said Frederic Letoffe, co-president of France’s GMH association of monument restoration firms.
Before Macron’s announcement, Letoffe had estimated the work would take 10 to 15 years.
But some things just can’t be rushed, for example the drying of concrete and sealants, “which can take months,” he said.
For architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte, the five-year goal is “tenable, but they’ll have to make the right technological choices.”
He advised replacing the old roof’s oak beams and lead sheeting with steel girders and titanium panels. “Those don’t burn,” he told France Inter radio.
Would an identical restoration take longer?
“Rebuilding exactly as it was is both humanly and technically possible,” said Francois Asselin, president of the CPME small and midsize business association and a specialist in restoring historic wooden roof frameworks.
Experts would nonetheless have an ace up their sleeve: US art professor Andrew Tallon took ultra-precise measurements of the cathedral’s interior and exterior in 2011 and 2012 that could be used to create a 3-D digital model.
Read More:Macron vows to rebuild Notre-Dame after devastating fire
“It’s quite possible to do it (in five years) using multinational companies that work extremely fast, the way they build a reinforced-concrete skyscraper,” said Benjamin Mouton, chief architect at Notre-Dame until 2013.
But that might mean abandoning the temptation to use traditional materials, even while replicating the aesthetics.
Purists might argue that a new “forest” of roof supports must be in oak, but modern materials could be lighter and stronger – and would be invisible to the millions of visitors to the cathedral each year.
“Five years is a very short timeframe for a wooden framework,” noted architect Christiane Schmuckle-Mollard, who helped restore the Strasbourg cathedral in eastern France.
Are there enough workers and materials?
“By September we’ll have to recruit 100 masons, 150 woodworkers and 200 roofers” to meet the five-year target, said Jean-Claude Bellanger, secretary general of France’s storied Compagnons du Devoir artisan mentoring network.
“Our sector suffers from a lack of youths and enthusiasm for these crafts,” agreed Letoffe. “But we have the capacity for mobilising the qualified talent.”
“And we have in France all the materials at our disposal, the wood, stone, zinc, copper and lead,” he added.
The Groupama insurance group, for example, has offered to provide the estimated 1,300 centenarian oaks required for an exact replica of the roofing framework, considered by many experts an architectural monument in its own right.
How much will it cost?
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said Wednesday that the price tag for such an ambitious project was not yet known.
But experts have given ballpark estimates in the hundreds of millions of euros — former culture minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon said anywhere from 600 million to one billion euros ($680 million to $1.1 billion).
Already some 850 million euros has been pledged, mainly from French billionaires and companies as well as the city of Paris and other authorities.
“The cost of the work isn’t the problem, it’s more about administrative delays,” said the GMH’s Letoffe. “The state needs to take measures to speed up the process.”
The government has named a former five-star general, Jean-Louis Georgelin, to oversee the race against the clock to wind up the work before France hosts the Olympic Games in 2024.

Peru’s former president kills himself to avoid arrest in corruption case,"
Peru’s former president Alan Garcia died in hospital on Wednesday after shooting himself in the head at his home as police were about to arrest him in a sprawling corruption case. He was 69.
The health ministry said Garcia died at 10:05 am (1505 GMT) of “a massive cerebral hemorrhage from a gunshot wound and cardiorespiratory arrest.”
Garcia was resuscitated three times after suffering heart attacks while undergoing emergency surgery, before finally succumbing, Peru’s Health Minister Zulema Tomas said.

 The Casimiro Ulloa Emergency Hospital in Lima earlier confirmed he had suffered “a bullet wound to his head.”
“This morning there was a regrettable accident: the president took the decision to shoot himself,” Erasmo Reyna, Garcia’s lawyer, told reporters outside the hospital after Garcia was admitted.
“Alan Garcia has died, long live APRA,” said Omar Quesada, the general secretary of Garcia’s American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA) party.
The attempted arrest unfolded at 6:30 am (1130 GMT) at Garcia’s home in Lima’s upmarket Miraflores neighbourhood.
Police were acting on an arrest warrant for money laundering that would have allowed Garcia to be held for 10 days, giving authorities time to gather evidence and prevent him from fleeing, the prosecutor’s office said.
Ricardo Pinedo, Garcia’s secretary, said the former president had four or five weapons in his home that were gifts from the armed forces. Police said he used one of those to shoot himself.
Interior Minister Carlos Moran said police “heard a gunshot a few minutes” after entering Garcia’s house before finding him “sitting down with a head wound.”
‘Condolences’
Peru’s President Martin Vizcarra expressed his sympathy on his Twitter account.
“Dismayed by the death of ex-president Alan Garcia. I send my condolences to his family and loved ones,” Vizcarra wrote in a tweet.
Chilean President Sebastian Pinera and Bolivia’s Evo Morales added their own condolences, while Colombian leader Ivan Duque said “with sadness we raise prayers” for Garcia’s family, adding: “Rest in peace.”
APRA congressman Mauricio Mulder said Garcia “took a dignified and honorable decision. An honourable act in the face of fascist persecution.”
Dozens of tearful supporters congregated at the hospital entrance when the news was announced.
Garcia, who was president from 1985-90 and again from 2006-11, was suspected of having taken bribes from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht in return for large-scale public works contracts.
In November, he sought refuge in the Uruguayan Embassy after a court ordered him not to leave the country for 18 months.
He applied for asylum but following 16 days in the embassy he left when his request was denied.
Garcia, a social democrat, claimed to be the target of political persecution, an accusation denied by centrist Vizcarra.
On Tuesday, Garcia had said he would neither try to flee nor hide again.
He had recently insisted that “there is no statement, evidence or deposit that links me to any crime and even less so with the Odebrecht company or the execution of any of its projects.”
Although under investigation by the public prosecutor’s office, Garcia had not been charged with anything. He had strongly protested his innocence and seemed prepared to cooperate with authorities.
Money laundering and bribes
He was one of four Peruvian ex-presidents embroiled in various corruption scandals – alongside Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (2016-18), Ollanta Humala (2011-16) and Alejandro Toledo (2001-06).
Kuczynski, who is accused of money laundering and was being held under a 10-day preliminary detention until April 20, was also taken to hospital on Wednesday suffering from high blood pressure.
The 80-year-old was being treated in intensive care and had a cardiac catheter fitted, lawmaker Gilbert Violeta said.
Toledo faces extradition from the United States, having been charged with taking a $20 million Odebrecht bribe.
Odebrecht has admitted paying $29 million in bribes to Peruvian officials over three administrations.
Some of those payments were allegedly made during Garcia’s second term in office to secure a contract to build the Lima metro.
Peruvian press reports also claim Garcia received a $100,000 payment from an illicit Odebrecht fund for giving a speech to Brazilian business leaders in Sao Paulo in May 2012.
Prosecutors allege that Garcia and 21 other officials conspired to enable Dutch company ATM Terminals to win a 2011 concession to operate a terminal at the port of Callao, near Lima.
Another ex-president, Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000), is serving a 25-year sentence for crimes against humanity and corruption.
His daughter, opposition leader Keiko Fujimori, is being held in pre-trial detention for up to three years, accused of accepting $1.2 million in illicit party funding from Odebrecht for her 2011 presidential campaign.

United States announces sanctions against Venezuela’s central bank,"
The United States on Wednesday announced sanctions against Venezuela’s central bank in its latest effort to strangle President Nicolas Maduro’s cash flow.
In a hard-hitting speech in Miami largely devoted to Cuba, National Security Advisor John Bolton also unveiled measures against a third leftist government in Latin America, Nicaragua, with sanctions against President Daniel Ortega’s son.
The United States said it would forbid all Americans’ dealings and block any US assets of the Central Bank of Venezuela as well as its director, Iliana Josefa Ruzza Teran, saying they were key conduits for funding Maduro’s government.

 “Treasury is designating the Central Bank of Venezuela to prevent it from being used as a tool of the illegitimate Maduro regime, which continues to plunder Venezuelan assets and exploit government institutions to enrich corrupt insiders,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement that accompanied Bolton’s speech.

The Treasury Department said it had taken precautions to ensure that ordinary Venezuelans can use debit and credit cards, even with the blacklisting of the central bank.
Bolton also announced action against Laureano Ortega Murillo, the son of Nicaragua’s leftist leader and Rosario Murillo, who is both vice president and first lady.
The Treasury Department accused the younger Ortega of “corrupt business deals” with foreign investors and of using the Nicaragua Grand Canal project – a long-running bid to build a rival to the Panama Canal – as a way to launder money.

Prince William to visit Christchurch in aftermath of mosques attacks,"
Britain’s Prince William will “bring comfort” to survivors of last month’s Christchurch massacre when he visits the city next week, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Wednesday.
The Duke of Cambridge will make a two-day trip starting on April 25 to the tragedy-scarred country, and is also set to meet first responders to the March 15 mosque attacks in which 50 people were killed.
“We welcome this visit by His Royal Highness and know it will bring comfort to those affected,” Ardern said in a statement.

“The Duke has a close connection with New Zealand and in particular Christchurch,” she added.
“His visit provides the opportunity to pay tribute to those affected by the mosque terrorist attacks and show support to the local and national community.”
The British royal visit will come six weeks after a self-avowed white supremacist killed 50 people in a shooting rampage at two mosques in Christchurch.
After arriving and attending engagements in Auckland, William will then head with Ardern to the South Island city, where the remainder of his programme will take place.
He will represent his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, the official head of state of the former British colony of New Zealand.
The Royals have previously expressed sympathy for the attacks, which stunned New Zealand’s small, tightly-knit Muslim community.

Trump hopes trade talks with China will be a success,"
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday held out hope the current trade talks with China will be a success and said an announcement on the status was due “shortly.”
The president’s remarks followed a report by The Wall Street Journal saying US and Chinese officials are tentatively working toward signing ceremony for a new trade agreement as soon as late May.
“I have a feeling we’ll be successful,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “That’s moving along quite well.”

 “You’ll be hearing about it very, very shortly.”
Citing an unnamed source, The Journal said US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer was expected to travel to Beijing for a new round of face-to-face talks the week of April 29.

The USTR office declined to comment on the report.
During shuttle diplomacy in recent months, US and Chinese officials have alternated between projecting optimism and warning that success in their high-stakes talks is not guaranteed.
But a key US demand – a binding enforcement mechanism to prevent Beijing from backsliding on its commitments – has been virtually agreed, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this month.
The two sides have exchanged tariffs on more than $360 billion in two-way trade since last year, weighing on both countries’ manufacturing sectors and unnerving global stock markets.
To help reduce Beijing’s soaring US trade surplus, Chinese officials have offered to increase purchases of American farm goods and energy exports.
But analysts say it remains unclear how far China will go in meeting US demands for fundamental changes in industrial policy that could weaken the communist party’s hold on power.

Govt deliberates shifting all its deposits to State Bank,"
KARACHI: The government is mulling over a proposal to introduce the Treasury Single Account (TSA) to shift all its deposits of various government departments and organisations with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
“While the proposal to introduce TSA is being examined by the Government of Pakistan in consultation with the SBP as part of its agenda to reform public financial management, however, no decision has yet been made to implement the TSA,” a press release issued by the SBP said on Wednesday.
The SBP further asserted that any decision in this regard will be taken after due consultation with all stakeholders and evaluating its impact on the banking sector.

 On the other hand, the bankers expressed their displeasure over the proposal saying that the government wanted to minimize its net borrowing from the banking system.
Sources privy to the matter believe that, with TSA, corruption could be eliminated from the deposits of several government departments and organisations.
The State Bank elucidated that it will be premature to form an opinion about the proposed policy and thus the market players should avoid engaging in any speculative activities based on this proposal which is still under examination.

TikTok ban worries wider tech industry,"
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: An Indian ban on downloading TikTok, one of the world’s most popular mobile applications, has heightened industry worries that technology companies could now face increased scrutiny and regulatory challenges in one of their most important markets.
TikTok, which allows users to create and share videos with special effects, has become a sensation in India, where it has been downloaded by nearly 300 million users so far, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower, out of more than 1 billion installs globally.
Its runaway popularity has attracted criticism from some politicians, however, in a largely conservative society that can have a low boiling point for even moderately racey content.

Keeping our TikTok India community informed is important to us. Unfortunately, due to an interim court order, the TikTok app has been temporarily taken down from online app stores as of April 17th, 2019. However, this interim ban does not affect hundreds of millions of existing users of the app. During this time, you can continue using TikTok to capture and share moments that matter in your life, making use of various features, stickers, and gestures, as well as participating in our in-app challenges. We are currently working hard on ensuring that anyone in India who wants to use TikTok to showcase your creativity, can do so freely. Do stay tuned for updates. Thanks for your support!

In the case of TikTok, 15-second dance clips and memes dominate the platform, although some videos do show youngsters, some scantily clad, lip-syncing and grooving to popular tunes. Local media have also reported several accidental deaths when users attempted to make videos with knives and guns.
The IT minister of Tamil Nadu state, M. Manikandan, said in February that “young girls and everybody is behaving very badly” on TikTok.
On Wednesday, TikTok vanished from Google and Apple’s app stores in India. The rare takedown of such a popular app came after the Madras High Court said the app encouraged pornography and asked the government to ban it. The federal IT ministry then issued a follow-up directive to Google and Apple.
Industry executives, technology lawyers and free-speech activists interviewed by Reuters on Wednesday said the ban was a major concern.
“It does unnerve me,” said a senior executive working for a social media company in New Delhi. “For the industry, it sets a worrying precedent in India.”
A TikTok spokesman said on Wednesday that it had faith in the judicial system and was “optimistic about an outcome that would be well received by” its millions of users in India. The state court will next hear the case on April 24.
Google told Reuters late on Tuesday it does not comment on individual apps but adheres to local laws. Apple did not respond to requests for comment.
CRITICAL MARKET
TikTok is not the first social media company to run into trouble in India.
Facebook and its messenger app WhatsApp, which count India as their biggest market, have been under pressure from authorities to better tackle fake news and monitor content on their platforms.
Global video streaming giant Netflix was dragged into a legal battle last year following a complaint that one of its fictional series insulted a former Indian prime minister.
But industry executives said the ruling against TikTok was particularly worrisome, given that it originated from a public interest complaint brought by an individual in Tamil Nadu – opening their digital content to judicial scrutiny that could potentially derail their India strategy overnight.
“It shows a level of uncertainty which is not great for investors, for private equity firms and for venture capital,” said Apar Gupta, executive director at advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation.
India is a critical market for social media and mobile digital content companies as the country is witnessing a sharp surge in use of smartphones. An estimated half-a-billion Indians now have access to the Internet.
Singapore-based Bigo, which has a live video streaming app, has also been expanding in India. TikTok’s owner Bytedance Technology Co, one of the world’s most valuable start-ups, also runs another social app named Helo, which allows users to share content in local languages.

Bytedance has more than 250 employees in India, with plans to expand further, one of its court filings showed. It had about two dozen India job openings listed on LinkedIn as of Wednesday.
SEXUAL PREDATORS
Such is the TikTok craze that a Reuters photographer recently saw more than a dozen youngsters shooting TikTok videos on their smartphones at a popular Mumbai promenade. While some danced as they lip-synced to songs, others used teddy bears as props.
The Tamil Nadu court, which ruled against TikTok, said inappropriate content was its dangerous aspect and that the app could expose children to sexual predators.
The ban does not apply to use of the TikTok app if it has already been downloaded.
The Chinese company unsuccessfully argued at the Supreme Court last week that a ban “amounts to curtailing of the (free speech) rights of the citizens of India”.
A “very minuscule” proportion of TikTok’s videos were considered inappropriate or obscene, the company said in its Supreme Court filing, adding that it was primarily an entertainment platform.
That argument cut no ice with the app’s critics, however.

It also struck a chord in some family living rooms in India.

India’s Jet Airways to suspend operations,"
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: India’s embattled Jet Airways Ltd is set to temporarily halt operations from Wednesday onward after its lenders rejected the airline’s plea for emergency funds, three sources from inside the company said on Wednesday.
The airline, saddled with roughly $1.2 billion of bank debt, has been teetering for weeks after failing to receive a stop-gap loan of about $217 million from its lenders, as part of a rescue deal agreed in late March.
Separately, two sources at state-run banks told Reuters on Wednesday that the banks had rejected the 4 billion rupees ($58 million) that Jet had sought to keep itself temporarily afloat, while its lenders attempted to identify an investor willing to acquire a majority stake in the airline and attempt to turn it around.

 “Bankers did not want to go for a piecemeal approach which would keep the carrier flying for a few days and then again risk having Jet come back for more interim funding,” said one of the bank sources directly involved in Jet’s debt resolution process.
All five sources declined to be named as they have not been authorized to discuss the matter with media.
Jet and its lead lender State Bank of India (SBI) did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
LESSORS FLEE
At its peak, Jet operated over 120 planes and well over 600 daily flights. The airline, once India’s largest private carrier, has been forced in recent weeks to cancel hundreds of flights and to halt all flights to overseas destinations.
The crisis at Jet, which owes vast sums to suppliers, pilots lessors and oil companies, has deepened in recent weeks as its lessors have scrambled to de-register and take back planes, in a sign the bailout plan had failed to assuage their concerns.
India’s aviation regulator said on its website on Wednesday that lessors had applied to de-register another four Boeing Co 737 planes.
An analysis of the latest data disclosed by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation shows that Jet’s lessors have, so far, sought to deregister and repossess at least 48 planes operated by Jet. Once deregistered, lessors are free to reclaim a plane and lease it to another airline.
The rapid exodus of planes risks further eroding value from the carrier, even as lenders scurry to find an investor willing to buy a majority stake in the debt-laden airline and attempt to turn it around.
Its lenders, led by SBI, have been seeking expressions of interest for an up to 75 percent stake in the airline. Initial expressions bids were submitted last week.

Astronaut Christina Koch to set record for longest spaceflight by a woman,"
NASA astronaut Christina Koch is going to have her mission on the International Space Station (ISS) extended to nearly 11 months, which would set a record for the longest spaceflight by a woman, the US space agency said Wednesday.
Koch, 40, arrived on the ISS on March 14 with two other crew members – an American and a Russian – for what was initially planned to be a six-month mission.
The two other astronauts will return to Earth on October 3 but Koch’s stay would be extended until February 2020, which would beat the record held by another female US astronaut, Peggy Whitson, who spent 288 days aboard the ISS in 2016-17, NASA said.

 “It feels awesome,” Koch said when told her mission was being prolonged. “I have known that this was a possibility for a long time and it’s truly a dream come true.”
Jennifer Fogarty, chief scientist of NASA’s Human Research Program, said Koch’s extended mission would provide additional data about the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the human body and “support future missions to the Moon and Mars.”

The record for an extended spaceflight by an American is held by US astronaut Scott Kelly, who spent 340 days aboard the ISS in 2015-16 with Russian Mikhail Kornienko.
The longest ever spaceflight was by Russia’s Valery Polyakov, who spent 14 months aboard the Mir space station in 1994-95.
The current team aboard the ISS is made up of three Americans – Koch, Anne McClain and Nick Hague – two Russians – Oleg Kononenko and Alexey Ovchinin – and a Canadian, David Saint-Jacques.
Between June and September, several astronauts will return to Earth and be replaced by others, including an Italian, Luca Parmitano, and the first ever astronaut from the United Arab Emirates, Hazzaa Ali Almansoori, who will spend about a week in space.
Astronauts are currently flown to and from the ISS using Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft. US manufacturers SpaceX and Boeing are developing their own transports and those are scheduled to be ready by the end of the year.
The ISS – a rare area of cooperation between Moscow and Washington – has been orbiting the Earth since 1998.

Scientists revive brain cell function in pigs hours after their deaths,"
Scientists have managed to restore cell function in the brains of pigs hours after they died, in a breakthrough Wednesday that experts said threw into question the very notion of what makes animals – or even humans – alive.
Authors of the US-based study said their research could one day be used to help treat victims of heart attacks and strokes and unravel the mysteries of brain trauma.
In human and large mammal brains, cells crucial for neural function begin to degrade as soon as blood supply is cut – a process long considered to be irreversible.

 But the findings of the trial, published in the journal Nature, show that the brains of pigs can have their blood flow and cell function restored even hours after death.
The team from the NIH BRAIN initiative, a federally funded US research programme, used the brains of 32 pigs that had been slaughtered for food and discarded, without blood or glucose flow, for four hours each.
Then, using a tissue support system that pumps a liquid designed to mimic blood through organs, they rehydrated the brains for a further six hours.
Some brains received the patented life-support solution and others were given a control substance.
Flickers of life
The results were astonishing: the brains that received the artificial blood had basic cell function restored. Their blood vessel structure was revived, and the team even observed some localised processes – including in synapses and immune responses – flickering back to life.
Those that received the control solution turned within hours to what researchers described as “something a bit like yoghurt”.
“I was tremendously surprised,” Nenad Sestan, a researcher at Yale University and lead study author told AFP.
“We were surprised how well the structure was preserved. We found that cell death is reduced, which is very exciting and promising.
“The main conceptual finding is this: cell death in the brain occurs across a longer time period than we previously thought,” Sestan added.
Read More:‘First’ 3D print of heart with human tissue, vessels unveiled
The team stressed that they saw no “higher level functional activity” such as electric signalling associated with consciousness in the revived brains.
“That is a clinical sign that the brain is alive, and we never found it,” said Sestan. “This is not a living brain, it is a cellularly active brain.”
Had any such activity been detected, the team said they would have had to deliver anaesthetic to the brains to null any pain – despite them having been dead for hours.
“If some activity shows up that indicated consciousness, we would have to stop the experiment,” said Stephen Latham, from Yale’s Centre of Bioethics.
“This would be unique: inducing consciousness in an organ that’s not connected to any living being.”
‘Not alive, not dead’
The findings suggest that scientists may have underappreciated the brain’s capacity for self-restoration after a patient is declared brain dead.
But for experts invited to comment on the study, it raised deeper philosophical and ethical questions.
Writing in a linked editorial, Nita Farahany, a professor of law and philosophy at Duke University, said that the study “throws into question long-standing assumptions over what makes an animal – or a human – alive.”
She said researchers had inadvertently created an ethical grey area where the pigs used were “not alive, but not completely dead.”
Dominic Wilkinson, professor of medical ethics at the University of Oxford, said that the study could have vital implications for future brain research.
“This research reminds us that ‘death’ is less an event, and more of a process that occurs over time,” he said.
“Cells within the human organism may be alive for some period of time after the human person has died.”
Zvonimir Vrselja, also at Yale School of Medicine’s Department of Neuroscience, said the team planned to use their support system on dead brains for longer periods of time in order to see how the cells react.
“We could potentially get some insight into how these brains could be saved,” he told AFP.

TikTok ban worries wider tech industry,"
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: An Indian ban on downloading TikTok, one of the world’s most popular mobile applications, has heightened industry worries that technology companies could now face increased scrutiny and regulatory challenges in one of their most important markets.
TikTok, which allows users to create and share videos with special effects, has become a sensation in India, where it has been downloaded by nearly 300 million users so far, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower, out of more than 1 billion installs globally.
Its runaway popularity has attracted criticism from some politicians, however, in a largely conservative society that can have a low boiling point for even moderately racey content.

Keeping our TikTok India community informed is important to us. Unfortunately, due to an interim court order, the TikTok app has been temporarily taken down from online app stores as of April 17th, 2019. However, this interim ban does not affect hundreds of millions of existing users of the app. During this time, you can continue using TikTok to capture and share moments that matter in your life, making use of various features, stickers, and gestures, as well as participating in our in-app challenges. We are currently working hard on ensuring that anyone in India who wants to use TikTok to showcase your creativity, can do so freely. Do stay tuned for updates. Thanks for your support!

In the case of TikTok, 15-second dance clips and memes dominate the platform, although some videos do show youngsters, some scantily clad, lip-syncing and grooving to popular tunes. Local media have also reported several accidental deaths when users attempted to make videos with knives and guns.
The IT minister of Tamil Nadu state, M. Manikandan, said in February that “young girls and everybody is behaving very badly” on TikTok.
On Wednesday, TikTok vanished from Google and Apple’s app stores in India. The rare takedown of such a popular app came after the Madras High Court said the app encouraged pornography and asked the government to ban it. The federal IT ministry then issued a follow-up directive to Google and Apple.
Industry executives, technology lawyers and free-speech activists interviewed by Reuters on Wednesday said the ban was a major concern.
“It does unnerve me,” said a senior executive working for a social media company in New Delhi. “For the industry, it sets a worrying precedent in India.”
A TikTok spokesman said on Wednesday that it had faith in the judicial system and was “optimistic about an outcome that would be well received by” its millions of users in India. The state court will next hear the case on April 24.
Google told Reuters late on Tuesday it does not comment on individual apps but adheres to local laws. Apple did not respond to requests for comment.
CRITICAL MARKET
TikTok is not the first social media company to run into trouble in India.
Facebook and its messenger app WhatsApp, which count India as their biggest market, have been under pressure from authorities to better tackle fake news and monitor content on their platforms.
Global video streaming giant Netflix was dragged into a legal battle last year following a complaint that one of its fictional series insulted a former Indian prime minister.
But industry executives said the ruling against TikTok was particularly worrisome, given that it originated from a public interest complaint brought by an individual in Tamil Nadu – opening their digital content to judicial scrutiny that could potentially derail their India strategy overnight.
“It shows a level of uncertainty which is not great for investors, for private equity firms and for venture capital,” said Apar Gupta, executive director at advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation.
India is a critical market for social media and mobile digital content companies as the country is witnessing a sharp surge in use of smartphones. An estimated half-a-billion Indians now have access to the Internet.
Singapore-based Bigo, which has a live video streaming app, has also been expanding in India. TikTok’s owner Bytedance Technology Co, one of the world’s most valuable start-ups, also runs another social app named Helo, which allows users to share content in local languages.

Bytedance has more than 250 employees in India, with plans to expand further, one of its court filings showed. It had about two dozen India job openings listed on LinkedIn as of Wednesday.
SEXUAL PREDATORS
Such is the TikTok craze that a Reuters photographer recently saw more than a dozen youngsters shooting TikTok videos on their smartphones at a popular Mumbai promenade. While some danced as they lip-synced to songs, others used teddy bears as props.
The Tamil Nadu court, which ruled against TikTok, said inappropriate content was its dangerous aspect and that the app could expose children to sexual predators.
The ban does not apply to use of the TikTok app if it has already been downloaded.
The Chinese company unsuccessfully argued at the Supreme Court last week that a ban “amounts to curtailing of the (free speech) rights of the citizens of India”.
A “very minuscule” proportion of TikTok’s videos were considered inappropriate or obscene, the company said in its Supreme Court filing, adding that it was primarily an entertainment platform.
That argument cut no ice with the app’s critics, however.
Hindu nationalist group Swadeshi Jagaran Manch, which is close to India’s ruling party and had previously criticized the app’s content, on Wednesday welcomed the ban, saying TikTok was “against Indian culture and morality”.
It also struck a chord in some family living rooms in India.

"TikTok vanishes from Google, Apple app stores","
NEW DELHI: The Chinese video app TikTok is no longer available in Google and Apple app stores in India after a state court prohibited its downloads, a setback for developer Bytedance Technology’s efforts to tap users in a key market.
TikTok, which allows users to create and share short videos with special effects, is hugely popular in India but some politicians say its content is inappropriate.
A court in Tamil Nadu asked the government on April 3 to ban TikTok, saying it encouraged pornography and warning that sexual predators could target child users.

 The government sent a letter requesting Apple and Google to abide by the state court’s order, according to an IT ministry official.
Google blocked access to TikTok in its Play store in India to comply with the court’s directive, a person with direct knowledge told Reuters on Tuesday. The app was not available in Apple’s app store on Wednesday.

Google said in a statement it does not comment on individual apps but adheres to local laws. Apple did not respond to requests for comment.
A spokesman for TikTok in India declined to comment on the app’s removal, saying the matter was still in the courts.
The company had faith in the judicial system and was “optimistic about an outcome that would be well received by” its millions of users in India, he added.
TikTok had been downloaded more than 240 million times in India, app analytics firm Sensor Tower said in February. More than 30 million users installed the app in January 2019, 12 times more than in the same month last year.
Jokes, clips and footage related to India’s thriving movie industry dominate the app’s platform, along with memes and videos in which youngsters, some scantily clad, lip-sync and dance to popular music.
Bytedance challenged the court’s ban order in India’s Supreme Court last week, saying it went against freedom of speech rights in India.
The top court had referred the case back to the state court, where a judge on Tuesday rejected Bytedance’s request to put the ban order on hold, K. Neelamegam, a lawyer arguing against Bytedance in the case, said.
The state court has requested written submissions from Bytedance in the case and has scheduled its next hearing for April 24.

"Qualcomm, Apple agree to drop all lawsuites against each other","

iPhone maker Apple and American microchip manufacturer Qualcomm said Tuesday they have agreed to “dismiss all litigation” against each other in a sprawling battle over royalty payments.
The deal includes a six-year license agreement with the option to extend for two years, and a payment to Qualcomm from Apple, the companies said.

 The two tech industry heavyweights were due to begin opening arguments in a federal courtroom on Tuesday in San Diego, California.
With the settlement, Qualcomm avoids what had promised to be a high-stakes battle that could have resulted in billions in payments to Apple.
Apple accused the company of abusing its market-dominant position to charge exorbitant amounts for its chips or access to its patents.
Qualcomm, which earns a significant chunk of its revenue from royalties it charges for its patented technology, denied the allegation and in turn accused Apple of abusing its position and using the courts as a tool to push prices down.
Word of the deal sent Qualcomm’s shares soaring on Wall Street, with the company’s stock up 21.1 per cent around 1940 GMT.
Apple’s shares were up slightly as well but in line with the broader market, adding 0.2 per cent.

"Apple, Google asked to take down TikTok app","
BENGALURU: Indian government has asked Google and Apple to take down popular Chinese short-video mobile application TikTok, said a report by Economic Times reported on Tuesday.
The tech giants were asked to take down TikTok from its app stores by Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology following the refusal of Supreme Court on Monday to put a stay of Madras High Court’s order to ban the app.
The move is likely to restrict further downloads of the app, but people who have already downloaded it will be able to continue using it on their smartphones, ET quoted people familiar with the development.

“The High Court asked the government to prohibit download of TikTok application. It (MeitY) is ensuring that by asking Google and Apple to delete it from the app stores. Now it is up to the companies to do it or appeal the order,” said one of the people.
The development came when a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi posted the matter for hearing to April 22 as the Madras High Court is expected to hear the case on April 16.
The Madurai bench of the Madras High Court had passed an order on April 3 to prohibit downloads of TikTok application in the country besides barring media companies from telecasting its videos.

The owner of app, ByteDance, had moved to the Indian Supreme Court last week against the high court’s verdict, seeking a stay against the ban as it was causing ‘irreparable damage to the company.
ByteDance counsel had argued that it cannot be held liable for actions of third parties on the platform. The app was like any other social media platform, it said, adding that singling out TikTok was discriminatory and arbitrary.
TikTok is a social media app for short-form mobile videos launched in China in September 2016 as ‘Douyin’ and one year later, it was introduced to globally as ‘TikTok’.
Death while filming TikTok video
A juvenile allegedly shot dead by his friend as he pointed a pistol towards him while making a video on mobile application TikTok, it had emerged on April 16.
The incident took place in New Delhi when Salman Zakir and his friends, Sohail and Amir, after were returning home after visiting India Gate.
Salman was driving the car, while Sohail was sitting next to him and Amir was in the rear seat. Sohail aimed the pistol at Salman to make the video, but the weapon discharged shooting Salman on his cheek.

Both the friends freaked out and drove the car to Sohail’s relatives’. Then they took the 19-year-old victim to a nearby hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead. Upon hearing this, they left the hospital and the hospital authorities later informed the police.
The two friends were arrested: one for firing the bullet and the other for disposing the weapon. Barakhamba Police Station has lodged a murder case and a case under Arms Act. Police said they were probing whether the bullet was fired deliberately or inadvertently.

YouTube accidentally links Notre-Dame fire to 9/11,"
SINGAPORE: A YouTube fact-check feature which is meant to tackle misinformation accidentally tagged live broadcasts of a fire engulfing Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris with details about the 9/11 terror attacks.
The blaze erupted in the UNESCO world heritage landmark in the French capital Monday, sending its spire and roof crashing to the ground as flames and clouds of smoke billowed into the sky.
The fire, which at one point threatened the entire edifice, was brought under control early Tuesday about nine hours after it broke out.

 News outlets began live-streaming broadcasts of the fire on YouTube, but below some of the clips an unusual text box popped up — an entry from the Encyclopedia Britannica about the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.

In those attacks, Al-Qaeda militants hijacked two passenger planes and flew them into the towers of the World Trade Center in New York, causing them to collapse, while a third hijacked jet smashed into the Pentagon. Some 3,000 people were killed.
A spokesman for YouTube, which is owned by Google, said the text box feature had been disabled for live streams related to the fire.
“These panels are triggered algorithmically and our systems sometimes make the wrong call,” the spokesman told AFP. “We are deeply saddened by the ongoing fire at the Notre-Dame Cathedral.”

The feature, which also links to other outside sources such as Wikipedia, was introduced last year after YouTube faced intense criticism over videos containing misleading and extreme content.
The panels are supposed to combat misleading videos about well-known events — such as the first successful manned landing on the moon — by presenting the true facts, in a bid to stop the spread of conspiracy theories.
YouTube, Facebook and Twitter came under fire last month after a horrific video of a gunman’s deadly rampage at two New Zealand mosques was circulated on the sites.

"Seychelles president dives deep into ocean, calls for ocean protection","
Seychelles President Danny Faure dived deep into the Indian Ocean Sunday to call for protection of “the beating blue heart of our planet.”
“This issue is bigger than all of us, and we cannot wait for the next generation to solve it. We are running out of excuses to not take action, and running out of time,” a statement released by the president’s office quoted him as saying.
Faure, who has made environmental protection a top priority, was taken down more than 120 metres (400 feet) in the submersible vehicle Ocean Zephyr which is being used for a mission dubbed “Nekton Deep Ocean Exploration” and which is rated for depths of more than 500 metres.

 “I can see not only the incredible beauty of our ocean, but the care that it urgently needs to stay this way. This is a historical moment for my country,” the president said of the 115-island archipelago.
The Nekton mission is to spend seven weeks studying underwater life, mapping the sea bed and placing captors at depths of up to 2,000 metres in the nation’s waters.

"‘First’ 3D print of heart with human tissue, vessels unveiled","
Scientists in at Tel Aviv University unveiled a 3D print of a heart with human tissue and vessels on Monday, calling it a first and a “major medical breakthrough” that advances possibilities for transplants.
While it remains a far way off, scientists hope one day to be able to produce hearts suitable for transplant into humans as well as patches to regenerate defective hearts.
The heart produced by researchers at Tel Aviv University is about the size of a rabbit’s.

 It marked “the first time anyone anywhere has successfully engineered and printed an entire heart replete with cells, blood vessels, ventricles and chambers,” said Tal Dvir, who led the project.
“People have managed to 3D-print the structure of a heart in the past, but not with cells or with blood vessels,” he said.
But the scientists said many challenges remain before fully working 3D printed hearts would be available for transplant into patients.
Journalists were shown a 3D print of a heart about the size of a cherry, immersed in liquid, at Tel Aviv University on Monday as the researchers announced their findings, published in the peer-reviewed journal Advanced Science.
Read More:New 3D printer uses rays of light to shape objects
Researchers must now teach the printed hearts “to behave” like real ones. The cells are currently able to contract but do not yet have the ability to pump.
Then they plan to transplant them into animal models, hopefully in about a year, said Dvir.
“Maybe, in 10 years, there will be organ printers in the finest hospitals around the world, and these procedures will be conducted routinely,” he said.
But he said hospitals would likely start with simpler organs than hearts.
Producing ‘ink’
In its statement announcing the research, Tel Aviv University called it a “major medical breakthrough”.
Cardiovascular disease is the world’s leading cause of death, according to the World Health Organization, and transplants are currently the only option available for patients in the worst cases.
But the number of donors is limited and many die while waiting.
When they do benefit, they can fall victim to their bodies rejecting the transplant — a problem the researchers are seeking to overcome.
Their research involved taking a biopsy of fatty tissue from patients that was used in the development of the “ink” for the 3D print.
First, patient-specific cardiac patches were created followed by the entire heart, the statement said.
Using the patient’s own tissue was important to eliminate the risk of an implant provoking an immune response and being rejected, Dvir said.
“The biocompatibility of engineered materials is crucial to eliminating the risk of implant rejection, which jeopardises the success of such treatments,” said Dvir.
Challenges that remain include how to expand the cells to have enough tissue to recreate a human-sized heart, he said.
The size of their resolution also limits current 3D printers and another challenge will be figuring out how to print all small blood vessels.
But while the current 3D print was a primitive one and only the size of a rabbit’s heart, “larger human hearts require the same technology,” said Dvir.
3D printing has opened up possibilities in numerous fields, provoking both promise and controversy.
The technology has developed to include 3D prints of everything from homes to guns.

Twitterites troll Karan Johar’s ‘Kalank’ movie,"
The high-budget Bollywood movie, Kalank has finally hit screens but could not leave a good impact on the cinemagoers whose expectations had risen after creation of big buzz for the movie for several weeks.
Producer Karan Johar seems to be struggling for making the movie a big hit yet again.
It is a complex romantic story set in Husnabad, the fictional neighbourhood of Lahore, during the era of the 1940s, pre-Independence India.

 The movie stars Varun Dhawan, Alia Bhatt, Sonakshi Sinha, Aditya Roy Kapur, Madhuri Dixit and Sanjay Dutt.
Twitterites have set the micro-blogging website on fire with the hashtag #KalankReview. The early reviews are not encouraging for the makers of the period drama. Many of them said that the film was extremely predictable.
Most of the film has been shot on grand, lavish sets by writer-director Abhishek Varman.

"Kangana’s sister, Alia’s mother join war of words between Bollywood stars","
Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut’s anger against Alia Bhatt for not supporting her movie Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi, is not hidden from anyone.
But the matter seems to be escalating quickly with Ranaut’s sister Rangoli Chandel stepping into the arena in her sister’s defense and with Bhatt’s mother Soni Razdan hitting back.
But earlier this week, the controversy took another turn with Kangana’s sister lashing out at Alia and her mother. She called them “non-Indians who are living off this land, using and abusing its people and its resources, lying about intolerance and spreading hatred”, she wrote in a tweet.

Soni Razdan wrote: “Mahesh Bhatt is the man who has given her a break…She goes on to attack his wife and daughter. Daughter over and over again. What is left to be said then about abusing and hatred I wonder. Apart from character of course. Agenda. What’s hers?”
But Rangoli was all set for giving her a long fact-check. She responded by writing a series of tweets ‘correcting’ Razdan
“Dear Soniji, Mahesh Bhatt never gave her a break, Anurag Basu did. Mahesh Bhattji works as a creative director in his brother’s production house.”

PM Imran Khan is one of the Time’s 100 most influential people for 2019,"
The well-celebrated Time Magazine has just published the list of “100 Most Influential People” for the year 2019 and it has the name of our Prime Minister Imran Khan in it too.

Prime Minister’s introduction in the list is written by the Pakistani veteran journalist, Ahmed Rashid. He starts off the intro writing about the era Pakistan is going through but “the man in charge is the closest it has to a rock star.” Shedding light on PM’s achievements, he pens about Pakistani cricket team’s victory in the 1992 world cup under his captaincy, Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and his academic venture Namal College for “kids who could never have dreamed of attending one.”

He went on to write, “Now he is Prime Minister of an impoverished nation that cannot pay its bills and is dependent on handouts from rich neighbors like China and the Arab Gulf states.” He thinks albeit being cold and fierce at times, he is still an epitome of hope for “young and old that he can turn Pakistan around, and help South Asia an ocean of peace” in lieu of a region with permanent conflict.

Beyonce drops another surprise album,"
WASHINGTON: Beyonce, the queen of surprise and so much else, has again dropped a record with no warning: a live album to go with an upcoming Netflix documentary on her performance at Coachella last year.
The album entitled “Homecoming,” just like the film, was released in the early hours of Wednesday across all major streaming platforms, including Apple Music, Spotify and Google Play.
It breaks that more than two-hour performance — she actually took to the stage twice last year at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival — into 40 tracks.

 Beyonce was the first black woman to headline the festival.
Her set paid tribute to the musical heritage of historically black American colleges and she was backed up by dozens of dancers and a marching band.
Beyonce first dropped an album without warning in 2013: the record “Beyonce” suddenly appeared in the iTunes music store with no advance notice.
And she has repeated the tactic since then with albums like “Lemonade” and “Everything is Love.”

‘Avengers: Endgame’ directors speak up after scenes leaked online,"
LOS ANGELES: The directors of “Avengers: Endgame” pleaded with fans on Tuesday not to spoil the movie by giving away storylines after reports that some scenes had leaked online.
In an open letter posted on Twitter under the hashtag #DontSpoilTheEndgame, Joe and Anthony Russo said they and the vast cast of the upcoming Marvel superhero movie “have worked tirelessly for the last three years with the sole intention of delivering a surprising and emotionally powerful conclusion” to the saga.


 “When you see Endgame in coming weeks, please don’t spoil it for others, the same way you wouldn’t want it spoiled for you,” they added.
Walt Disney Co’s “Avengers: Endgame” marks the conclusion of a story told across 22 Marvel films. The plot has been shrouded in secrecy, with no advance screenings for the entertainment press. Sales of advance tickets earlier this month surpassed those of 2015 movie “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”
The film, which brings together multiple comic book characters, starts its rollout on April 24 in Australia and China before arriving in the United States on April 25.
Some fans said on Tuesday they had seen brief, grainy scenes on Reddit, YouTube and other platforms, but the footage was swiftly removed. Reuters has not seen the leaked scenes and Disney declined to comment.
The #DontSpoilTheEnding hashtag was one of the top Twitter trends on Tuesday. Some fans who said they had viewed the leaks said they only increased their anticipation for the movie.
“I was upset for about 0.2 seconds then realized how cool it was and it made me so hyped,” a person with the user name thestaggie posted on Reddit.

Chris Smith, a contributor to the BGR.com entertainment and tech news site, wrote that he had seen a leak but that it “doesn’t really give away the ending” of the movie, although it contained scenes that had not been shown in any of the trailers or official clips released so far.
“I don’t consider that the leak has actually ruined the movie for me. It just makes me want to watch it even more than I already did,” wrote Smith.

‘Haven’t read scripts’: Game of Thrones writer remains unaware of final season’s ending,"
“Game of Thrones,” the fantasy epic imagined more than 20 years ago by author George R.R. Martin, will have its much-anticipated finale on HBO later this year.
But in a strange twist never before seen in literature, Martin will himself discover the on-screen ending of his long-running masterwork before he has had a chance to conclude the fantasy on paper.
“Obviously, I wished I finished these books sooner so the show hadn’t gotten ahead of me,” Martin said recently in an interview with Entertainment Weekly before the final season began airing on April 14 on HBO. “I never anticipated that.”

 When the Emmy Award-winning television series about noble families vying for the Iron Throne was launched in 2011, the American author had only written four of the seven books that make up his “Song of Ice and Fire” saga.
His fifth novel, “A Dance With Dragons,” was published in July 2011, a few weeks after the end of the first season.
But since then, book fans have eagerly been awaiting the last two novels — “The Winds of Winter” and “A Dream of Spring.”
The plot lines for both have already been adapted to the screen based on outlines Martin discussed with screenwriters David Benioff and Dan Weiss on how he foresaw the end of his saga.
“This is simply unprecedented,” Nicolas Allard, a French author who wrote a book about “Game of Thrones,” told AFP.
He noted that while British author JK Rowling sold the film rights for the first four “Harry Potter” books to Warner Bros., she was able to write the ending of her saga before it hit the big screen.
Read More:Artificial Intelligence predicts who survives ‘Game of Thrones’
But in Martin’s case, Allard said although the author had given “Game of Thrones” screenwriters a rough idea of how he envisioned the ending, it is unclear whether the show will stick to his storyline.
“I haven’t read the (final season) scripts and haven’t been able to visit the set because I’ve been working on ‘Winds,'” Martin told Entertainment Weekly. “I know some of the things. But there’s a lot of minor-character (arcs) they’ll be coming up with on their own.
“And, of course, they passed me several years ago. There may be important discrepancies.”
Different ending on paper?
According to several experts interviewed by AFP, Martin is not bound by the television story line and he may well choose to depart from it.
“His contract stipulates that he has to come up with the denouement for the series and provide an outline of what would happen,” Allard said. “But he is free to choose a different ending on paper.
“And that would be the first time this would happen in the literary world.”
He said for example that Jon Snow could very well die of his stabbing wound in the next novel rather than be resuscitated as was the case on screen.
For Sarah Mesle, assistant professor of writing at the University of Southern California, it’s all but guaranteed that Martin will move away from the television storyline.
“Even if he sticks to the same series of events… there’s no way he can be in the world and not know the way that the audience has responded to the different plot points or the way that we came to love some characters and not others,” she told AFP.
“I mean he’s… been very much a part of the fan culture of the show, and I think his sense of how audiences feel about his story will certainly affect his choices.”
Allard noted as an example that Martin was upset when, in season six of the television series, the origin of the White Walkers – formerly-human ice creatures – was revealed.
“He wanted to be the one to reveal that in his novels,” Allard said. “Now, it’s like the television series and the novels are two separate artistic elements.”
Mesle says it is clear the television series has overtaken the story line and upstaged Martin.
“All of a sudden we have this TV show that has the storytelling status over a book,” she said.
“Whether Martin finishes the series or not, once the TV show started to surpass the novels, the novels are now going to be an adaptation of the TV show,” she added. “There’s no way around it.”

Food brand to fight listeria class action,"
JOHANNESBURG: South Africa’s leading food producer Tiger Brands said on Wednesday it will fight a class action lawsuit over its role in the world’s largest ever listeria outbreak.
The listeriosis outbreak, the infection caused by the bacteria, killed more than 200 people in South Africa last year and was traced back to a factory run by Tiger Brands-owned Enterprise Foods.
Tiger Brands confirmed to the stock exchange that it had received a summons with respect to the class action lawsuit, which has been in the offing for some time.

 “The company intends to defend the class action,” the statement said, adding it would follow due legal process and issue further updates when appropriate.
The company’s shares were down 0.9 percent at 0811 GMT.
The amount of damages being claimed was not identified in the summons, it continued, because the first stage of the class action is concerned with liability and not damages, which will be dealt with at a subsequent stage once there has been a ruling on liability.
It said that the plaintiffs are seeking damages under the terms of the Consumer Protection Act and for exemplary, punitive or constitutional damages, which Tiger Brands said it has been advised are not recognized in South African law.
While the company has product liability insurance cover, this does not include cover for exemplary or punitive damages, which are damages intended to punish the defendant for its conduct and deter it and others from similar behavior in future.
Listeriosis causes flu-like symptoms, nausea, diarrhea and infection of the blood and brain. It poses a higher risk for newborns, the elderly, pregnant women and people with weak immunity.

"For its health and yours, keep the cat indoors","
At least one running argument among cat lovers is now over: Whiskers, Lucy and Tigger are definitely better off staying indoors, scientists reported Wednesday.
Pet cats allowed outdoors, in fact, are nearly three times as likely to become infected with pathogens or parasites than those confined to quarters, they reported in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters.
Two-legged house-mates should also take note because cats — a.k.a. Felis catus — can transmit some of those diseases to humans, the authors said.

 Intriguingly, the farther domesticated felines are from the equator, the more likely they are to be afflicted by some kind of bug or virus, if they spend time outdoors.

“Each degree in absolute latitude increased infection likelihood by four percent,” said lead author Kayleigh Chalkowski, a researcher at the School of Forestry and Wildlife Sciences at Auburn University in Alabama.
“You think of tropical regions as just having more wildlife, more parasites,” she told AFP. “But it turned out that latitude had the opposite effect.”
To settle the indoor-vs-outdoor question once and for all, Chalkowski and colleagues combed through nearly two dozen earlier studies in which the prevalence of one or more diseases was compared across interior and exterior environments.
All told, the new study looked at 19 different cat pathogens in more than a dozen countries, including Spain, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Pakistan, Brazil, the Netherlands and St. Kitts.
‘Keep your cat indoors’
“This is the first time outdoor access as a risk factor for infection in cats has been quantified across a wide range of geographic locales and types of pathogens,” Chalkowski said.
The effects were consistent for almost all of the diseases, including feline roundworm and the single-cell parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, both of which can affect humans.
This held true regardless of how they were transmitted — whether from soil, other cats, or prey such as mice and birds.
“Basically, no matter where you are in the world, keeping your cat indoors is a great way to keep them healthy from infectious diseases,” Chalkowski said by way of summary.

This is especially good advice, she added, “considering that many of the pathogens cats carry can actually be spread to humans”.
Other domesticated animals transmit disease to their caretakers — dogs, for examples, spread rabies, and cattle carry Cryptosporidium parvum, a parasitic disease that attacks the intestinal tract.
Wild cats were likely first drawn to human communities in search of rodents, and were domesticated some 5,000 years ago. In ancient Egypt, they were associated with gods and prominently featured in hieroglyphics.
There are some 90 million pet cats in the United States, and an estimated 500 million worldwide.

"New limbs, new life for South Sudan amputees","
JUBA, South Sudan: Stephen, 12, romps confidently around the sunlit courtyard, weaving in between wheelchair-bound patients as he plays with the other children, his prosthetic leg barely a hindrance.
When he was five years old, the car he and his family were travelling in hit a landmine in South Sudan’s northern town of Bentiu. His grandmother was killed. His left leg was shattered and had to be amputated.
Stephen was flown to a physical rehabilitation centre run by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Juba, which serves both as a prosthetics factory and a hospital for patients coming from all around the country to be fitted with new limbs.

 “It helped me to go to school,” Stephen says shyly, pointing to his artificial leg.
After receiving his first prosthesis in 2013, war prevented Stephen from being able to return for new fittings every six months as recommended.

When he finally made it to the centre this month, his prosthesis was far too short.
South Sudan’s five-year-long civil war has left possibly tens of thousands of people without limbs — a toll that may never be accurately established.
Approximately 60 percent of the patients who come to the Juba centre — one of three in the country — have gunshot-related injuries and disabilities, according to the ICRC.
But much of the country faces limited access to healthcare, a result of fighting or simply a lack of infrastructure, with roads typically being utterly impassable during the rainy season.
Many limbs are amputed for no other reason than lack of treatment.
“A simple injury or fracture that could be treated easily in most countries… can result in infections here which result in an amputation because of problems with healthcare,” said ICRC prosthetic specialist Regis Tiffeneau.
“The large majority of patients are affected by the war in one way or the other.”
Others became disabled by polio, rickets — linked to malnutrition — or other diseases that have been eliminated in so many other parts of the world.
Lack of access
In the factory, plaster is slapped on models of legs whirring on machines as workers shape them and then slather them in dark brown plastic.
Workshop manager Emmanuel Loubari said that the prosthesis can be made within a day of a patient being measured and a cast taken. Last year the centre made 580 prosthetic limbs, with the cost of all treatment borne by the ICRC.
But many challenges face patients who need to get fittings.

“We have a lot of patients who are supposed to be fitted, but they cannot have access to the centre,” Loubari said.
In South Sudan, roads are so bad that the ICRC relies on a fleet of planes and helicopters to bring patients to hospitals and the physical rehabilitation centres.
In the rainy season, it can be hard to land in many remote locations.
Bringing people from across the country, injured in fighting mostly of an ethnic nature, brings its own problems.
“They come here, they are traumatised, most of them are injured by gunshots and mines,” said social worker James Soma. “We talk to them about forgiveness.”
He said an argument had broken out the previous day in which one patient accused another of targeting her because of her tribe, and said she would “bring one of my relatives and shoot you all.”
Toddlers shot on mothers’ backs
For those who have used a prosthesis before, like Stephen, it takes only two or three days before they are ready to go home. But for new patients it can take a few weeks.
Other patients at the centre currently include a young man with severe scoliosis — a curved spine — who was being taken to school in a wheelbarrow until he was brought in to get a customised wheelchair.
Another was bitten by a snake and was not treated for almost two weeks, so his leg had to be amputated.
“We have a lot of children coming in,” said physiotherapist Oketta Robert Kanyara. “We have five children in the centre, shot in different styles… We have children shot while tied to their mothers’ backs.”
Five-year-old Laytol was probably bitten by a snake. Her mother comes from the Murle people, and the doctors have difficulty understanding the language. But they believe her leg “could probably have been saved” if she had got help in time.
Laytol is trying out her new leg for the first time, balancing herself calmly between two metal bars.
Kanyara, the physiotherapist, said training children requires using games, as they do not understand the idea of shifting their weight and struggle to follow instructions.
But progress can be made. When the physiotherapist started work with Stephen, the boy who lost his leg in a landmine in 2013, the challenges were many.
“It was very, very difficult,” Kanyara said. “You tell him to do weight bearing, but he starts crying, so you have to go slowly.”
Little Laytol took to her new leg more quickly.
“She is very good,” Kanyara said. “She is fitted today, and she is not crying. She is walking.”

Germany reopens painful debate on assisted suicide,"
BERLIN: Germany’s highest court will begin hearing on Tuesday a case brought by terminally ill patients and doctors against a law banning professional assisted suicide services, reopening a bitter debate.
Lawmakers had passed the so-called Paragraph 217 in November 2015, which penalises anyone who turns assisted suicide into a professional service — with or without payment.
But a Leipzig administrative court’s ruling two years later, in 2017, raised questions about the law, as judges found that in extreme cases, the authorities could not refuse life-ending medication to terminally ill patients.

 The contradictory signals have fuelled renewed debate on an issue that has huge resonance in a fast-ageing country where the Church still exerts strong influence.
It is also a particularly sensitive subject as the Nazis had used what they called “euthanasia” to exterminate around 200,000 disabled people.

From Tuesday, the Federal Constitutional Court will begin considering the latest challenge brought by six plaintiffs — among them terminally ill patients, doctors and associations that provide support to people seeking assisted suicide.
In practice, the 2015 law means that a husband who helps his terminally ill wife to die would not be prosecuted.
But an association or a business that repeatedly offered to help people die would face prosecution.
The situation is also not so clear-cut for doctors who prescribe deadly cocktails to patients.
In their case before the constitutional court, the patients argue that their general personal right extends to their right to a self-determined death.
The medical practitioners are meanwhile seeking legal certainty in cases when they are required to prescribe palliative medication.
‘Right to self-responsible death’
Doctor Matthias Thoens told news agency DPA that since the law came into force, he has been worried he could be charged if any of his patients were to abuse the palliative drugs he had prescribed.
“If someone took his own life without my knowledge or will, I’d be the subject of an investigation,” he said.

But he said he had brought the challenge also because he felt it would be “criminal to leave such patients on their own”.
As his fellow plaintiff and doctor, Michael de Ridder, wrote in the Die Zeit weekly: “There is not only a right to life, but also a right to self-determined death.”
The associations among the plaintiffs meanwhile charge that the law has essentially also banned them from being there to support their members in their last days.
Ahead of the hearing, the Catholic Church piled on the pressure, with Berlin’s Archbishop Heiner Koch warning the court against “shifting the value system” in Germany.
The court should “send a strong signal for the protection of lives”, he told the Funke newspaper group.
Amid the controversy, the authorities were also waiting for the court to deliver clarity.
Since the Leipzig court’s ruling in 2017, more than 100 applicants have written the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices for medication to end their lives.
Under Health Minister Jens Spahn’s order, none of the applications has been approved pending the latest court challenge.
“Anything else would mean that bureaucrats, or in the end I as a minister, would decide who gets to die with state help and who doesn’t,” Spahn told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily.
Euthanasia is officially legal in only three countries in Europe — the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg — but others allow or tolerate a form of assisted suicide.
In Switzerland, as well as in the US states of Vermont, Oregon and Washington for example, assisted suicide is legal.
