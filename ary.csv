ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has written a letter to the United Nation Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, drawing attention to the evolving situation in the occupied Kashmir, ARY News reported. 
A letter written by FM Qureshi stated that “India in its war madness is not only sabotaging the regional peace but also committing a gross violation of human rights along the LoC.”


 The letter reads that India is committing brutalities on innocent and defenseless Kashmiri people under the draconian laws in the occupied Kashmir.

Two more Texas shooting victims die in attack called domestic terrorism,"
EL PASO, Texas: Two more victims of a shooting rampage at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas died of their wounds on Monday, police said, raising the death toll to 22 in a massacre that prosecutors say was an act of domestic terrorism.
The latest fatalities brings to 31 the number of people killed during the weekend in mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, that have touched off a new furor over gun violence in the United States.
Patrick Crusius, 21, has been charged with a single count of capital murder in the El Paso case, court documents show, in what is likely a legal place holder to keep him in custody while the investigation is underway.

 Authorities have cited a lengthy anti-immigrant manifesto, apparently posted online by the suspect before the Saturday morning shooting in the heavily Hispanic border city, which they said was evidence the bloodshed was racially motivated.
The four-page statement uploaded to 8chan, a largely un-moderated online message board often used by extremists, called the Walmart attack “a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.”
The El Paso killings prompted 8chan founder Frederick Brennan, in an interview with the New York Times, to call for the site to be shut down. Brennan no longer has control of the site, which is now run from the Philippines by a U.S. Army veteran, the Times reported.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Saturday’s rampage appeared to be a hate crime and federal prosecutors called it domestic terrorism. A Texas prosecutor said the state will seek the death penalty against Crusius if he is convicted.


U.S. President Donald Trump said Americans “must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy” and blamed the internet and violent video games for fostering violence.
COOPERATING WITH AUTHORITIES

It was unclear if Crusius had retained a lawyer or would make an initial court appearance. El Paso Police Chief Greg Allen said the suspect was cooperating with investigators.


The suspect’s grandparents said in a statement read to reporters by a family outside their home in the Dallas suburb of Allen, 650 miles east of El Paso, that they were devastated by the attack.
“He lived with us in our house in Allen, Texas, while he attended Collin College,” they said. “He moved out of our house six weeks ago and has spent a few nights here while we were out of town.”
FBI Director Christopher Wray told a congressional panel on July 23 that the bureau has recorded about 100 arrests of domestic terrorism suspects in the preceding nine months and that most investigations of that kind involve some form of white supremacy.
The Texas rampage was followed just 13 hours later by the mass shooting in Ohio and came a week after a man shot dead three people at a California garlic festival before taking his own life.
In Dayton, Ohio, a gunman in body armor and a mask killed nine people in less than a minute and wounded 27 others in the downtown historic district before he was shot dead by police.
Police said the El Paso suspect opened fire with a rifle on Walmart shoppers, many of them bargain-hunting for back-to-school supplies, then surrendered to officers who confronted him outside the store.
In El Paso, residents on Monday brought crosses representing each of the victims to a growing memorial site near the store.
El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, together with the neighboring city of Las Cruces, New Mexico, form a metropolitan border area of some 2.5 million residents constituting the largest bilingual, bi-national population in North America.

Mexico president urges US to take action on gun control,"
MEXICO CITY: Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador called Monday for the United States to “control the indiscriminate sale of weapons” after a shooting in Texas left eight Mexicans dead.
A gunman opened fire with an assault rifle on Saturday at a Walmart store in El Paso, which is located near the border with Mexico, killing a total of 22 people and wounding more than two dozen.
Lopez Obrador said neither Republicans nor Democrats in the US have done enough to protect people from mass shootings.

 “If we look at things objectively, we have to say that the two main US parties have given little attention to gun control,” Lopez Obrador said in his morning press conference.
While Democratic politicians have long pushed for stricter firearms regulations, they have been stymied by Republicans with backing from the powerful National Rifle Association gun lobby.
“We’re very respectful of what other governments decide, but we feel that these unfortunate events in the United States require reflection, analysis and the decision to control the indiscriminate sale of weapons,” Lopez Obrador said.
He said his government was studying the possibility of accusing the suspected shooter, named in US media as 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, of “terrorism” and requesting his extradition to face charges in Mexico.
Mexico’s Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard met with the families of the Mexican victims on Monday.
He named the victims as Sara Esther Regalado, Adolfo Cerros Hernandez, Jorge Calvillo Garcia, Elsa Mendoza de la Mora, Gloria Irma Marquez Juarez, Maria Eugenia Legarreta Rothe, Ivan Filiberto Manzano and Juan de Dios Velazquez Chairez.
El Paso is a US city of 680,000 people, some 83 percent of whom are Hispanic, and it borders Mexico’s Ciudad Juarez.

Trump supporter jailed for sending bombs to Democrats,"
NEW YORK: A supporter of President Donald Trump was sentenced to 20 years in prison on Monday for mailing crude bombs to prominent Democrats including ex-president Barack Obama and former presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
Cesar Sayoc, a one-time pizza delivery man who lived in a white truck plastered with pro-Trump and anti-Democrat stickers, broke down and wept as the sentence was handed down in a New York court.
His case fueled the debate about extremism in the Trump era, which intensified at the weekend following two shootings that left 31 dead and dozens wounded in Texas and Ohio.

 “The nature and circumstances of the crimes are by any nature horrendous,” said District Judge Jed Rakoff as he delivered the sentence.
Sayoc, a one-time strip club DJ and pizza delivery man, pleaded guilty in March to 65 charges relating to 16 package bombs he sent from a Florida post office to leading Democrats and the Manhattan offices of CNN.
The 57-year-old admitted making the homemade devices from materials including plastic piping, a digital alarm clock with electric wiring attached, fireworks and glass fragments.
Besides Obama and Clinton, those targeted included billionaire George Soros, former president Bill Clinton, former vice president Joe Biden, and actor Robert De Niro.
Several Democratic lawmakers, including 2020 presidential hopefuls Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, were also targeted.
None of the packages exploded and most did not come anywhere near their intended recipients but they sparked a two-week panic and heightened political tensions in the lead-up to the US midterm elections in November 2018.
Critics say Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric helps fuel white nationalist thinking that engenders violence. On Monday Trump said the US “must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy.”
Estranged from his family and in financial distress, Sayoc discovered a passion for Trump just as the president’s political star was rising.
He shared pro-Trump images on social media and posted articles from ultra-conservative and conspiracy-driven websites such as Infowars and Breitbart. In one post he was seen wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat.
He reportedly ranted to colleagues about Jews as well as blacks and gays.
Trump’s inner circle initially attempted to distance the president from Sayoc until filmmaker Michael Moore released footage of the bomber attending a Trump rally, one month after the inauguration.
Prosecutors had called for life imprisonment for Sayoc. His defense said the minimum of a decade behind bars was appropriate, arguing that Sayoc suffered mental health problems and only intended to scare the recipients.
The martial arts practitioner was arrested in Florida in October five days after the first device was discovered in Soros’s upstate New York mailbox.
Police found Sayoc’s fingerprints and DNA on the packages. He apologized for his actions
Sayoc has a criminal record dating back to 1991, peppered with convictions for theft, fraud, violence and a threat to blow up his electric utility company.

Police divers quit search of river for Canada murder suspects,"
MONTREAL: Police divers in Canada have wound up their search of a river in northern Manitoba for any trace of two teenage fugitives wanted for the killings of three people, officials said Monday.
The divers had been searching the Nelson River after a battered aluminum boat was found Friday on its shore, in the vast area near Gillam being scoured for the fugitives, but no evidence of them was found.
“The Underwater Recovery Team has completed their work following the discovery of a boat on the shore of the Nelson River,” the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said in a statement on Twitter.

 “They will not be conducting any additional dives. A police roadblock has been put in place today in the Sundance, MB, area for ongoing search efforts,” it added.
The discovery of the empty boat had come days after police said they were scaling back the search for Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, which at its peak involved tracker dogs, a drone and search planes equipped with infrared cameras.
The teens are wanted in connection with the murder of Lucas Fowler, 23, of Australia, and his American girlfriend Chynna Deese, 24, who were found shot dead alongside the Alaska Highway in northern British Columbia on July 15.
The teens have also been charged with the murder of Leonard Dyck, 64, a Canadian biology professor, whose body police found later also in northern British Columbia.
Police had not ruled out that the two fugitives may have died in the inhospitable region of swamps and dense forests, home to swarms of biting insects and bears.
But the pair may have dodged the huge manhunt and escaped the area.

"July hottest month measured, 2019 set to be among warmest years","
July was thehottestmonth across the globe ever measured, and 2019 is on track to be one of the warmest years, according to data released Monday by the European Union’s Earth observation network.
Searing heatwaves saw records tumble across Europe last month, with unusually high temperatures around the Arctic Circle as well.
Wildfires unprecedented in scope and intensity burned in Siberia and Alaska, releasing more than 100 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere across June and July.

 At the same time, Greenland’s ice sheet shed massive amounts of melted ice daily, totalling nearly 200 billion tonnes in July alone, according to the Danish Meteorological Institute.
“While July is usually the warmest month of the year for the globe, according to our data it also was the warmest month recorded globally, by a very small margin,” Jean-Noel Thepaut, head of the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, said in a statement.
“With continued greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting impact on global temperatures, records will continue to be broken in the future.”
Compared with the 1981-2010 period, average July temperatures this year rose highest in Alaska, Greenland, Siberia, central Asia, Iran and large swathes of Antarctica.Africa and Australia were also well above average.
Globally, July 2019 was marginally warmer — by 0.04 degrees Celsius (0.072 Fahrenheit) — than the previous record-hot month, July 2016.
– ‘Not science fiction’ –
The new record is all the more notable because the 2016 record followed a strong El Nino, which boosts average global temperates beyond the impact of global warming alone.
El Ninos are naturally occurring weather events triggered by periodic warming — every three to seven years — in the eastern Pacific Ocean.
“July has rewritten climate history, with dozens of new temperature records at local, national and global levels,” World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement a few days ago.
Global warming, he added, was clearly to blame.
“This is not science fiction,” he said. “It is the reality of climate change.”
Every month so far in 2019 ranks among the four warmest on record for the month in question, with June being thehottestJune measured, the Copernicus team said in a press release.
Accurate temperature records extend into the 19th century, starting around 1880.
The Copernicus service is the first of the world’s major satellite-based climate monitoring networks to report average July temperatures.
– ‘Not your grandfather’s summer’ –
The margin of increase is small enough, it noted in a press release, that other networks — such as the US government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) — may report temperatures equal to or slightly below the July 2016 record.
“Typically, there is a difference between the values provided by the global temperature datasets of various institutions, and the Copernicus difference between July 2019 and 2016 temperatures is smaller than this margin,” the agency said in a statement.
“We have always lived through hot summers, but this is not the summer of our youth. This is not your grandfather’s summer,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said late last week.
“All of this means that we are on track for the period from 2015 to 2019 to be the fivehottestyears on record.”
Every year in the 21st century except one has been among thehotteston record, a fact that defies explanation without the dominant influence of manmade global warming, scientists say.
Europe has endured two exceptionally strong heatwaves in a matter of weeks.
Record highs tumbled across France, with the mercury peaking at 46C on June 28 in the southern town of Verargues. The previous record, set back in 2003, was 44.1C.
The second wave of heat saw Paris’s all-time high pulverised last month: Meteo France measured 42.6C in the French capital on July 25 — more than 2C hotter than the previous high, set more than 70 years ago.
In the first half of the year, temperature records were also shattered in New Delhi, Anchorage, Santiago and part of the Arctic Circle.
The Paris Climate Agreement enjoins nations to cap global warming at “well below” 2 C above pre-industrial level. The year 2018 was about 1C above it.

Putin to Trump: We’ll develop new nuclear missiles if you do,"
MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Monday that Moscow would be forced to start developing short and intermediate-range land-based nuclear missiles if the United States started doing so after the demise of a landmark arms control treaty.
The United States formally left the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with Russia on Friday after determining that Moscow was violating the treaty and had already deployed at least one banned type of missile, an accusation the Kremlin denies.
The pact banned land-based missiles with a range of between 310 and 3,400 miles (500-5,500 km), reducing the ability of both countries to launch a nuclear strike on short notice.

 Putin on Monday held a meeting with his Security Council after which he ordered the defence and foreign ministries and Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service to closely monitor any steps the United States took to develop, produce or deploy missiles banned under the defunct treaty.
“If Russia obtains reliable information that the United States has finished developing these systems and started to produce them, Russia will have no option other than to engage in a full-scale effort to develop similar missiles,” Putin said in a statement.
In the meantime, he said Russia’s arsenal of air and sea-launched missiles combined with its work on developing hypersonic missiles meant it was well placed to offset any threat emanating from the United States.
It was now essential, he added, for Moscow and Washington to resume arms control talks to prevent what he described as an “unfettered” arms race breaking out.
“In order to avoid chaos with no rules, restrictions or laws, we need to once more weigh up all the dangerous consequences and launch a serious and meaningful dialogue free from any ambiguity,” Putin said.

"Trump denounces white supremacy after shootings, cites video games and internet","
WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump on Monday called for urgent action to prevent gun violence and said all Americans must “condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy” after mass shootings in Texas and Ohio killed 29 people and wounded dozens.
Trump, whose rhetoric has frequently been condemned as stoking racial divisions, laid out a number of policy options but did not mention his own past remarks.
“These sinister ideologies must be defeated,” Trump said in remarks at the White House. “Hate has no place in America. Hatred warps the mind, ravages the heart and devours the soul.”

 On Saturday, a gunman killed 20 people at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, in what authorities said appeared to be a racially motivated hate crime. Just 13 hours later, another gunman in downtown Dayton, Ohio, killed nine people.
Trump said mental health laws should be reformed to better identify mentally disturbed individuals and he called for capital punishment for those who commit mass murder and hate crimes.
He said he had directed the Justice Department to work with local authorities and social media companies to detect mass shooters before they strike. He said the Internet, social media and violent video games had helped radicalize people.
Earlier on Monday, Trump had urged lawmakers in a tweet to put strong checks in place on potential gun buyers, suggesting action could be tied with immigration reform. In his remarks at the White House, however, he did not mention immigration.

Chinese yuan falls to weakest level against dollar since 2010,"
SHANGHAI: China’s decision to let its currency weaken against the dollar on Monday sent global markets diving further into the red and provoked a Twitter tirade from US President Donald Trump.
The deteriorating picture appeared to worsen as official Chinese media reported Beijing ceased purchases of American farm exports.
The Chinese yuan fell to its lowest level against the dollar since August 2010 in morning trading on Monday, fuelling speculation that Beijing is allowing currency depreciation to counter threatened US tariffs.

 US President Donald Trump reacted angrily later in the day, accusing China of deliberately and improperly weakening its currency.
“China dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. It’s called ‘currency manipulation.’ Are you listening Federal Reserve?” he said on Twitter, calling the change “a major violation” which would “greatly weaken China.”
Near 1335 GMT, the offshore currency weakened to 7.1114 to the dollar — the worst since 2010 — days after Trump announced a plan to impose fresh tariffs on another $300 billion in Chinese goods, sharpening trade war tensions between the world’s two biggest economies.
The onshore yuan also tumbled, hitting 7.0536 in Monday morning trade to reach its lowest level since 2008.
Global equity markets were in selloff mode, with major indices in Asia, Europe and the United States down two percent or more.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about 840 points around 1850 GMT.
Both the onshore and offshore yuan breached the 7.0 level against the dollar for the first time in nine years, which investors see as a key threshold in currency value.
Trump has frequently accused China of artificially depreciating its currency in order to support its exports — charges long denied by Beijing.
So far the US Treasury Department has not formally accused China of currency manipulation.
A ‘weaponised’ exchange rate
Trump jolted global stock markets last week when he announced more tariffs just a day after US and Chinese trade negotiators revived talks aimed at ending the year-long trade dispute.
The extra 10 percent duties Trump plans to implement from September 1 would mean he has now targeted virtually all of the roughly $550 billion in goods America buys from China every year.
Official news agency Xinhua said Monday the new tariffs “seriously violated the consensus” that Trump had reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping in June.
China on Friday had threatened to retaliate against any new US tariffs — it has already imposed its own duties on $110 billion worth of American goods, almost all of the American products it imports.
The yuan is not freely convertible and the government limits its movement against the US dollar to a two percent range on either side of a central parity rate which the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) sets each day to reflect market trends and control volatility.
The daily central rate was at 6.9225 per dollar on Monday, 0.33 percent weaker from Friday.
“It appears that the tariffs hike suggests the return of tit-for-tat moves and a suspension of trade talks, and the PBOC sees no need to keep the yuan stable in the near term,” Ken Cheung, a senior currency strategist at Mizuho Bank, told Bloomberg News.
In a statement on Monday morning, the PBOC said the exchange rate against the US dollar had been “affected by unilateralism and trade protectionism measures and the imposition of tariff increases on China”.
The central bank said the yuan remained “stable and strong against the basket of currencies” and said it would “resolutely crack down on short-term speculation and maintain stable operation of the foreign exchange market and stabilise market expectations”.
It went on to say that it had the “experience, confidence and ability to keep the RMB exchange rate basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level”.
Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist with Capital Economics, said the PBOC has “effectively weaponised the exchange rate” by linking the currency with the US trade war.
“Given that their goal is presumably to offset some of the impact from additional US tariffs, they are likely to allow the currency to weaken further, probably by 5-10 percent over the coming quarters,” said Evans-Pritchard.

‘Battle Mode’ Huawei sees China smartphone sales surge,"
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG: When 23-year-old Chinese student Aaron Huang started his hunt for an Android replacement for his Apple iPhone in April this year, it was clear which brand was trying hardest to win him over.
Promotional campaigns by Huawei Technologies and from local retailers supporting the brand were everywhere, said Huang, adding he was influenced by domestic media coverage that portrayed the United States as unfairly targeting the Chinese tech giant in its trade war.
“I felt like I should choose Huawei,” he said.

 The advertising blitz and grassroots patriotism have proven to be a potent mix, amplifying the brand’s existing broad appeal in its home market – a market it is increasingly dependent on as Washington’s ban on sales of U.S. components and software to Huawei hammers overseas demand.
Second-quarter China smartphone shipments for Huawei surged by a nearly a third from the same period a year earlier, with its market share rocketing 10.6 percentage points to a record 38%, according to research firm Canalys. Shipments for domestic rivals and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) plummeted.
Huawei has lifted its China sales target for its consumer business group, said a company source, who was not authorized to speak on the matter and declined to be identified.
Within Huawei, employees refer to current strategies as “Battle Mode” and it has stepped up the opening of new stores including “Experience Centers” in the style of Apple shops, other company sources said. One Experience Center near its South China headquarters opened last month while a bigger one in Shenzhen’s tech district of Nanshan will open next month.
Analysts say Huawei has also been transferring unsold smartphone stock from other regions to China and even offering some rare discounting in its home and overseas markets as it seeks to offset sales declines in Europe and the United States.
Huawei declined to comment on its strategies for marketing and managing inventories, or its China sales target. It reiterated an earlier statement that it was not trying to trade on patriotic fervor.
LOTTERIES AND BULLFROGS
Sales promotions have included interest-free installment payment plans and lotteries for its premium P30 and Mate series. Analysts add that products from its three brands – Huawei, nova and Honor – outnumber those from rivals in every market segment.
Firms like Chinese electronics retailer Gome (0493.HK) and small businesses have been eager to lend a hand, linking Huawei phones with patriotic support.
Fang Xia, a 38-year-old restaurant owner in Shanghai, said she was motivated by recent coverage of Huawei’s dispute with the United States to offer her customers a special deal.
“Tables that have four or more people with Huawei smartphones will get one free plate of Emperor Bullfrog,” proclaims an advertisement for her restaurant’s signature 88 yuan ($12.50) deep-fried frog dish.
Huawei’s overseas smartphone sales tumbled 28% in the second quarter from the previous quarter, Canalys data showed, but the full impact of the ban is not yet known.
Warning that Huawei products could be a vehicle for Chinese espionage, the Trump administration now requires that U.S. corporations which conduct business with Huawei gain a special license to do so. U.S. government responses to requests for those licenses could come this week, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last Tuesday.
In other measures to counter the ban which could strip its access to Google’s (GOOGL.O) Android, Huawei is accelerating efforts to develop its own operating system called Hongmeng. It is looking to roll out a low-end smartphone equipped with Hongmeng in the fourth quarter, state-media outlet Global Times reported on Sunday.
Huawei declined to comment. It has previously said Hongmeng is designed for internet-of-things products and it prefers Android for its smartphones.
Even before the U.S. ban, Huawei had been making big strides in China, moving upmarket into the $500-800 price range and luring customers away from the likes of Apple with improved camera quality.
“In any segment, it has several options for consumers, that is more than any other brand has to offer,” said Canalys analyst Mo Jia, describing Huawei’s strategy as one of “bombardment”.
Rivals are hurting. Xiaomi saw its second-quarter China shipments tumble 20% from the same period a year earlier, Vivo’s slid 19% while Oppo’s dropped 18%. Apple’s shipments fell 14%, and analysts and Chinese consumers say the U.S. firm could be hit further amid an intensifying U.S.-China trade war.
Xiaomi, Apple, Oppo and Vivo declined to comment.

Malaysia plans to extend license for rare earths producer Lynas,"
KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia plans to extend Lynas’s license to operate a rare earths processing plant, though it could be for a shorter duration than the usual three years, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The Australian company has been running the plant in Malaysia since 2012 using rare earths mined from Mount Weld in Western Australia, despite a dispute over the removal of low-level radioactive waste produced by the plant.
A decision to extend the license by a Sept. 2 deadline is important for the market for rare earths, as Lynas is the biggest producer outside China. Beijing has in the past tightened supply of the materials, used in everything from military equipment to high-tech consumer electronics.

 The sources, who declined to be named ahead of a government announcement expected by mid-August, told Reuters that the precise duration of the extension was not yet finalised.
Lynas, which sells most of its products to Japan, declined to comment.
The prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to an emailed query seeking confirmation of the license extension.
The company said in June it was stockpiling production of rare earth element Neodymium Praseodymium (NdPr) for strategic customers amid China-U.S. trade tensions that have stoked concerns that Beijing could curb rare earths exports again.
Yeo Bee Yin, Malaysia’s minister for energy and the environment, said on the weekend that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad’s cabinet had made a less-than-ideal decision on Lynas and that a detailed announcement would be made later this month.
“I have to say this decision made is not the most ideal in my view but I have made my suggestions,” she told reporters. “It’s far better than the status quo.”
The company’s shares fell as much 5.6% on Monday after online news portal Malaysiakini said, citing one unnamed source, that a decision on the license could be delayed by as much as six months.
Lynas has already offered to shift the waste, which some ruling coalition politicians have called hazardous, to “disused mines” in the state of Pahang where the plant is located.
“I still believe that Lynas should not be allowed to operate and continue to generate radioactive waste that will have long-term negative effects,” member of parliament and opponent of Lynas’ plans, Fuziah Salleh, said in a statement on Sunday.

Indian shares plunged to fresh five-month lows, led by losses in metals and public sector bank stocks, in a global selloff due to the escalating Sino-US trade war, while the government’s move to remove special status of the occupied Kashmir region also stoked worry.
The Chinese yuan broke below the psychological 7-per-dollar threshold after US President Donald Trump abruptly decided on Thursday to slap 10 per cent tariffs on the remaining $300 billion in Chinese imports. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.7pc.
The Indian rupee hit its weakest level since Mid-May at 70.49 rupees per dollar.

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government introduced plans to weaken the special rights of residents in Kashmir, amid heavy deployment of security forces and suspension of phone and internet services in the valley.
“There is uncertainty in how the situation evolves, and it adds political uncertainty to the existing set of issues the market is dealing with,” said Sunil Sharma, Chief Investment Officer at Sanctum Wealth Management.
Domestic investor sentiment inequities, which seemed to be upbeat on Friday after reports said the government was looking into foreign portfolio investors’ tax concerns, returned to being bearish due to the escalating trade war.
The broader NSE index was down 1.11pc at 10,868.25 as of 0801 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was 1.11pc lower at 36,670.62.
“The economy is in doldrums and steps taken won’t give a boost in the short-term. The global economy is also doing much better than the domestic economy,” said Madhumita Ghosh, Associate Dean at Tasmac Global Solutions.
“We don’t see any trigger for markets to go up in the short term.” Most sectors were trading in the red.
The Nifty public sector bank index plummeted as much as 5.12%, while the metals index sank as much as 3.9%, their lowest in over three years. The Nifty autos index slithered down about 1.9pc.
Nifty IT was the only index trading higher, boosted by the weak rupee.
The India volatility index shot up as much as 16.16%, its highest in over two months.
Yes Bank was the top loser among the Nifty stocks and fell about 6.7%, while Tata Motors was down 4.7pc. Among the few gainers were Tata Consultancy Services, up 1.4%, and Infosys Ltd, which rose 0.5pc.

"Google pledges carbon-neutral shipping, recycled plastic for all devices","
SAN FRANCISCO: Alphabet’s Google on Monday announced that it would neutralize carbon emissions from delivering consumer hardware by next year and include recycled plastic in each of its products by 2022.
The new commitments step up the competition among tech companies aiming to show consumers and governments that they are curbing the environmental toll from their widening arrays of gadgets.
Anna Meegan, head of sustainability for Google’s devices and services unit, said in an interview that the company’s transport-related carbon emissions per unit fell 40% last year compared to 2017 by relying more on ships instead of planes to move phones, speakers, laptops and other gadgets from factories to customers across the world.

 The company will offset remaining emissions by purchasing carbon credits, Meegan said.
Three out of nine Google products for which the company has detailed disclosures online contain recycled plastic, ranging from 20% to 42% in the casings for its Google Home speakers and Chromecast streaming dongles.
In a blog post, Google committed to introducing some recycled plastic to 100% of products by 2022.
Meegan acknowledged that Google’s 3-year-old hardware business trails far larger hardware rival Apple in some sustainability efforts.
Apple, which in 2017 committed to “one day” only using recycled and renewable materials, has at least 50% recycled plastic in some parts of several products, recycled tin in at least 11 products and recycled aluminum in at least two.
But sustainability standards are now a part of Google’s hardware planning, Meegan said. Devices cannot clear the second checkpoint in the company’s design process unless they show that sustainable packaging and materials and ease of repair have been considered.
“We are fundamentally looking to build sustainability into everything we do,” she said. “It’s going to take us time to demonstrate progress.”

‘Battle Mode’ Huawei sees China smartphone sales surge,"
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG: When 23-year-old Chinese student Aaron Huang started his hunt for an Android replacement for his Apple iPhone in April this year, it was clear which brand was trying hardest to win him over.
Promotional campaigns by Huawei Technologies and from local retailers supporting the brand were everywhere, said Huang, adding he was influenced by domestic media coverage that portrayed the United States as unfairly targeting the Chinese tech giant in its trade war.
“I felt like I should choose Huawei,” he said.

 The advertising blitz and grassroots patriotism have proven to be a potent mix, amplifying the brand’s existing broad appeal in its home market – a market it is increasingly dependent on as Washington’s ban on sales of U.S. components and software to Huawei hammers overseas demand.
Second-quarter China smartphone shipments for Huawei surged by a nearly a third from the same period a year earlier, with its market share rocketing 10.6 percentage points to a record 38%, according to research firm Canalys. Shipments for domestic rivals and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) plummeted.
Huawei has lifted its China sales target for its consumer business group, said a company source, who was not authorized to speak on the matter and declined to be identified.
Within Huawei, employees refer to current strategies as “Battle Mode” and it has stepped up the opening of new stores including “Experience Centers” in the style of Apple shops, other company sources said. One Experience Center near its South China headquarters opened last month while a bigger one in Shenzhen’s tech district of Nanshan will open next month.
Analysts say Huawei has also been transferring unsold smartphone stock from other regions to China and even offering some rare discounting in its home and overseas markets as it seeks to offset sales declines in Europe and the United States.
Huawei declined to comment on its strategies for marketing and managing inventories, or its China sales target. It reiterated an earlier statement that it was not trying to trade on patriotic fervor.
LOTTERIES AND BULLFROGS
Sales promotions have included interest-free installment payment plans and lotteries for its premium P30 and Mate series. Analysts add that products from its three brands – Huawei, nova and Honor – outnumber those from rivals in every market segment.
Firms like Chinese electronics retailer Gome (0493.HK) and small businesses have been eager to lend a hand, linking Huawei phones with patriotic support.
Fang Xia, a 38-year-old restaurant owner in Shanghai, said she was motivated by recent coverage of Huawei’s dispute with the United States to offer her customers a special deal.
“Tables that have four or more people with Huawei smartphones will get one free plate of Emperor Bullfrog,” proclaims an advertisement for her restaurant’s signature 88 yuan ($12.50) deep-fried frog dish.
Huawei’s overseas smartphone sales tumbled 28% in the second quarter from the previous quarter, Canalys data showed, but the full impact of the ban is not yet known.
Warning that Huawei products could be a vehicle for Chinese espionage, the Trump administration now requires that U.S. corporations which conduct business with Huawei gain a special license to do so. U.S. government responses to requests for those licenses could come this week, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last Tuesday.
In other measures to counter the ban which could strip its access to Google’s (GOOGL.O) Android, Huawei is accelerating efforts to develop its own operating system called Hongmeng. It is looking to roll out a low-end smartphone equipped with Hongmeng in the fourth quarter, state-media outlet Global Times reported on Sunday.
Huawei declined to comment. It has previously said Hongmeng is designed for internet-of-things products and it prefers Android for its smartphones.
Even before the U.S. ban, Huawei had been making big strides in China, moving upmarket into the $500-800 price range and luring customers away from the likes of Apple with improved camera quality.
“In any segment, it has several options for consumers, that is more than any other brand has to offer,” said Canalys analyst Mo Jia, describing Huawei’s strategy as one of “bombardment”.
Rivals are hurting. Xiaomi saw its second-quarter China shipments tumble 20% from the same period a year earlier, Vivo’s slid 19% while Oppo’s dropped 18%. Apple’s shipments fell 14%, and analysts and Chinese consumers say the U.S. firm could be hit further amid an intensifying U.S.-China trade war.
Xiaomi, Apple, Oppo and Vivo declined to comment.

Huawei tests smartphone with own operating system,"
SHANGHAI: Huawei Technologies is testing a smartphone equipped with Hongmeng, the company’s self-developed operating system, which could potentially go on sale by the end of this year, Chinese state-media outlet Global Times reported.
The release of a Hongmeng-powered smartphone would mark a major step for China’s Huawei, the world’s second-biggest maker of smartphones, as U.S. government actions threaten its access to Google’s Android operating system.
The device will be priced at around 2,000 yuan ($288), the Global Times said on Sunday, citing unnamed sources. That will place the device toward the low-end segment of the smartphone market.

 Huawei did not immediately comment on the report when contacted by Reuters on Monday.
Huawei executives have previously described Hongmeng as an operating system designed for internet-of-things products. Last month the company said the first major devices powered by Hongmeng would be its upcoming line of Honor-brand smart TVs.
Company leaders have publicly downplayed the possibility that the software could power a smartphone.
Last week, at an event announcing the company’s earnings for the first half of 2019, Huawei chairman Liang Hua said the company preferred to use Google’s Android operating system for its mobile devices and referred to Hongmeng as part of Huawei’s “long-term strategy”.
Huawei has been at the center of geopolitical tension between the United States and China since May, when President Donald Trump placed the company on an “entity list” that effectively barred American suppliers from selling to the company.
Trump has signalled that the sanctions will be relaxed, although further details remain scarce. If the policies remain enforced, Huawei could potentially lose access to regular updates to Android.
Huawei’s revenue in the first half of 2019 grew 23%, in part due to strong domestic demand for its mobile phones.
While smartphone sales tanked overseas, its shipments in China increased 31% year-on-year in the June quarter, according to market research firm Canalys.
Analysts attribute the robust performance at home in part due to the quality of its devices, which have long led China’s high-end Android phone market, and in part due to patriotism among consumers.

"PUBG maker, other Chinese gaming giants unveil patriotic games","
SHANGHAI: Chinese gaming companies, including giants Tencent and NetEase, unveiled new titles at an industry meet that show off socialist values and patriotic themes.
The games, introduced at China’s largest gaming convention that ended on Monday, point to the industry’s rapidly changing landscape after state suspension of fresh approvals last year against a backdrop of growing criticism of addiction among younger players and violent content.
Titles showcased at China Digital Entertainment Expo and Conference, known as ChinaJoy, ranged from ones that promoted domestic culture to others that recounted the country’s history, such as Shengqu Games’ “Codename: South China Sea”, which allows users to run a coastal town set in the Ming Dynasty.

 Tencent said it was collaborating with state newspaper People’s Daily to roll out a new game, “Homeland Dream” and on a title called “Story of my Home”.
Players of “Homeland Dream”, for example, will be tasked to develop a city that will need to execute policies like poverty alleviation and tax reduction, which are key goals of Beijing.
“This year is the 70th anniversary of the founding of new China, to that end Tencent has done much pre-planning and made investments to the theme of ‘me and my motherland’ … to create products reflective of the current era,” Steven Ma, Tencent’s senior vice president, said on the sidelines of the conference.
SEEKING RECOVERY
Tencent’s push to show off its red credentials comes as it was hit particularly hard by last year’s lengthy freeze in approvals in the world’s largest gaming market.
It was forced to pull a popular Texas Hold’Em poker video game and then waited in vain for over a year for approval to earn money on global blockbuster “PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds” (PUBG) even after giving it a makeover.
Tencent later pulled PUBG and shifted users to a similar, more patriotic version.
Shares of the world’s top gaming firm tumbled more than 40 percent in 2018, but have recovered slightly since then.
The company’s new titles mark its “desire to survive and is a very rational business choice”, said Fang Kecheng, assistant professor in the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
“These themes sometimes can perform well on the market, so it doesn’t totally conflict with business interest.”

Tencent’s main rival, NetEase, also said it was making more efforts to promote Chinese traditional culture and values in its titles such as “Ink, Mountains and Mystery”, an adventure game with monster characters from traditional Chinese mythology.

French ‘Flying Man’ crosses Channel on jet-powered hoverboard,"
PARIS/SANGATTE: French inventor Franky Zapata on Sunday succeeded in crossing the English Channel on a jet-powered hoverboard he designed after a previous ended with him falling into the sea.
Standing on a platform powered by five small jet engines and carrying kerosene in a backpack, Zapata took off from Sangatte, just outside Calais in France at about 0617 GMT, trailed by three helicopters.
He reached Britain just over 20 minutes later, waving to onlookers before landing safely in Saint Margaret’s Bay, close to Dover on Britain’s southern coast, according to French television images.

 “For the last five to six kilometers I just really enjoyed it,” Zapata told reporters on arrival. “Whether this is a historic event or not, I’m not the one to decide that, time will tell.”
“We made a machine three years ago…and now we’ve crossed the Channel, it’s crazy,” he said, before breaking into tears.
Zapata’s biggest challenge was refueling with another backpack halfway through the 35-km journey across the Strait of Dover, which required landing on a platform mounted on a boat.
On his first attempt to make the crossing on July 25, Zapata was knocked off balance in the process and fell. The inventor used a bigger boat and platform this time.
Zapata, who wowed crowds during France’s Bastille Day celebrations on July 14 by soaring over a military parade in Paris on the device, said on arrival that the hoverboard had reached speeds of 160 to 170 km per hour during the crossing.
‘My life’s work’
Zapata has been developing his hoverboard for the past three years, despite losing two fingers during its maiden flight in his garage near Marseille, when they got sucked into the turbines.
He already holds the Guinness World Record for the farthest hoverboard flight, a 2.2-kilometre trip over the Mediterranean Sea in April 2016.
No Guinness adjudicator will be on hand for the latest Channel attempt, though a spokeswoman said he could still be awarded a new record if the trip meets its guidelines.
Zapata burst into the spotlight at this year’s July 14 Bastille Day military parade in Paris, where he and his craft soared noisily above a crowd of stunned onlookers that included French President Emmanuel Macron.
His device has also captured the attention of the French military, which in December gave Zapata’s company, Z-AIR, a 1.3 million euro ($1.4 million) development grant.
Defence Minister Florence Parly told France Inter radio that it might eventually serve a variety of purposes, “for example as a flying logistical platform or, indeed, as an assault platform.”
“I can’t help it, the first time I saw it fly I said, ‘This is going to be my life’s work’,” Zapata told the French online media site Brut in a recent interview.

Tariff threat may compound Apple’s iPhone woes,"
Apple could see a hit to its annual earnings from U.S. President Donald Trump’s newly proposed 10% tariff on Chinese imports from Sept. 1, analysts from Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Friday.
“Our back of the envelope math suggests the impact (of the new tariffs) will be roughly $0.50-$0.75 (annualized per share) hit to earnings with roughly $0.30-$0.50 from iPhones,” the brokerage said.
Shares in Apple, which reported a surprise improvement in its fortunes in China earlier this week, sank 2.5% in morning trade, adding to similar losses a day earlier after Trump tore up a trade truce with China that had lasted just over a month.

 The United States and China have been locked in a trade war marked by tit-for-tat tariffs since last year. The tensions have disrupted global supply chains and roiled financial markets.
The BofA note also provided for the possibility that Apple might raise prices of iPhones by around 10%, reducing demand by 20% or around 10 million units.
Apple effectively cut iPhone prices in China earlier this year after currency exchange rates had made the phones too expensive for many Chinese consumers.
Globally, iPhone sales fell 12% to $25.99 billion in the latest reported quarter, after dropping 17% in the second quarter.

LAHORE: A petition seeking ban on youngsters’ famous mobile app Tik Tok has been filed in Lahore High Court.
As per details, petitioner Advocate Nadeem Sarwar contended that Tik Tok was spoiling the youth by wasting their money and time. The app was promoting vulgarity and was further giving rise to blackmailing and harassment in society, the petition read.
The federal government, Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) were made parties to the petition calling for a ban on the Tik Tok.

 The petition requested the court to direct the PTA to restrict Tik Tok in the country while instructing the federal government to draft a privacy protection act.
“The court should stop the PEMRA from broadcasting Tik Tok videos,” the petitioner said.

India court asks central bank to confirm WhatsApp’s compliance with data rules,"
MUMBAI: India’s top court has given the central bank six weeks to report on whether WhatsApp had complied with data localization norms as the Facebook-owned messenger gears up to launch a payments service in the country, a person involved in the matter said.
WhatsApp has been testing a peer-to-peer payments service for over a year in India, its biggest market by users, but local data storage norms have delayed an official launch.
Foreign payment companies were caught off guard last year by the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) directive that said all payments data should be stored “only in India” for “unfettered supervisory access”.

 This June it clarified the rules saying foreign payment firms can process transactions made in India outside of the country but the related data should be brought back for local storage within 24 hours.
WhatsApp faced an additional hurdle as a Delhi-based think-tank, the Centre For Accountability And Systemic Change, alleged in a petition to the Supreme Court last year that the firm was not compliant with payments data localization rules.
It is in regard to this petition that the Supreme Court has now asked the RBI to file a response.
WhatsApp did not immediately respond to a request for comment while the Reserve Bank of India declined to comment.
Last week, WhatsApp’s global head Will Cathcart said WhatsApp was all set to roll out its payments service in India this year and that it was now in full compliance with the data localization norms. [nL4N24R24A] [nL4N1WP2FQ]
On Friday, the Supreme Court also asked the federal government to make clear, within six weeks, its position on whether the company’s grievance officer should be based in India, according to the person.
WhatsApp has a California-based grievance officer who handles India-related issues. Current Indian rules do not mandate a tech company to have such an executive stationed in the country – a rule the government wants to change.
The country’s technology minister has said in parliament that New Delhi is seriously considering that social media firms “be required to locate their grievance officer in India”.
WhatsApp has previously said it is working on having a grievance officer based in India.

Singer R. Kelly charged in Minnesota with solicitation involving minor,"
Singer R. Kelly, jailed in New York last month after he was charged in Brooklyn and Chicago with numerous sexual misconduct felonies, was charged on Monday in Minnesota with soliciting sex from a minor at a Minneapolis hotel room 18 years ago.
The 52-year-old R&B vocalist known for such hits as “I Believe I Can Fly,” is accused in the Minnesota case of paying a 17-year-old girl $200 to take off her clothes and dance for him, and then engaging in sexual contact.
Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said, however, that the sexual activity did not include intercourse. He said the girl told an older brother about the incident at the time, but “did not come forward until all these other allegations about R. Kelly” surfaced. She called a law enforcement hotline with her account in January.

 Kelly’s lawyer, Steve Greenberg, posted a message on Twitter saying, “Give me a break. This is beyond absurd.”
The Grammy-winning performer, whose full legal name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, already is accused of preying on numerous juveniles in federal cases in New York City and Chicago and in a state case brought in Cook County, Illinois.
An indictment filed in federal court in Brooklyn last month accuses Kelly of running a criminal enterprise in which he recruited women and underage girls to have sex with him, isolating them, and often controlling what they ate and when they went to the bathroom.
Kelly was charged separately in Chicago with having sexual contact with five minors and recording sexually explicit videos of some of them. He is also accused of using threats and bribes to silence his alleged victims.
In February, prosecutors in Cook County, Illinois, charged Kelly with 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse of an underage victim.
The criminal cases were brought after seven women, including Kelly’s wife, appeared on a Lifetime television documentary in January accusing him of emotional and sexual abuse.
The performer, who has pleaded not guilty in the New York and Chicago cases, has denied abuse allegations for decades. In 2008, he was tried on child pornography charges and acquitted.
The Hennepin County prosecutor said the singer remained in custody in New York, “so exactly the time he will come to Minnesota is not clear.”
The Minnesota complaint charges Kelly with two felony counts – for a jury to consider – engaging in prostitution with a minor and hiring a minor for purposes of sexual contact. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of five years.
At a news conference to announce the case, Freeman said the alleged incident occurred in July 2001 after the accuser approached Kelly seeking an autograph during a promotional event at the City Center in downtown Minneapolis.
According to Freeman, Kelly gave the teenager his autograph and his phone number and told her to call him. When she did, she was directed to go to a hotel where a member of Kelly’s staff ushered the girl to his suite where he offered her $200.

Hira Mani says she wants to project her real life through Instagram,"
Actress Hira Mani who won hearts with her stellar performance in Do Bol doesn’t want her Instagram to look like a portfolio but rather reflect who she is in real life.
She shared in an interview with BBC Asian Network that her Instagram following has increased from 0.6 million to 2 million within a span of six months. She said she doesn’t want it to look like a typical portfolio but rather realistic, that’s why she posts crazy pictures on it even.
The actress spoke about the insurmountable love she has received from her fans and said that “My success has made me even more humble and grounded.”

 The starlet revealed that she refused a morning show nine years back although she shot the promo because her son was hardly 20 days old and she decided to prioritize family over work. When her children reached a certain age, she decided to venture into the entertainment industry.
Speaking about her hit drama Do Bol in which she starred opposite Affan Waheed, she said “It was a life changing experience. It gave me the due recognition and made everyone notice that I am a good actress.”
Mani said that due to similar work ethic, Waheed and her chemistry turned out great and the couple became fans favourite.
On whether after a successful drama, she feels the pressure of finding good scripts, she said “I don’t feel that pressure. It’s not necessary that every project is successful, the next one could be a hit or miss.”
The Bandish actress said that she had to do a few supporting roles before the industry realised she is a heroine material and offered her lead roles.

Original ‘Lion King’ animators are unhappy with remake,"
The animators of Disney’s original 1994 The Lion King find the CGI remake of the mega hit “cheap”.
After 15 years, the Disney classic was reimagined and made into a live action movie. But the artists who contributed to it aren’t sure about the remake.
When Huffington Post reached out to 13 original animators of Jon Favreau’s remake, only three were willing to speak on record.

 David Stephe, who worked on the ‘Circle of Life’ opening sequence said “If you polled the crew of the original ‘Lion King,’ most of them would say, ‘Why? Did you really have to do that?’ It kind of hurts.”
He added that Disney’s mindset is just to make money now “That’s disappointing as an artist, from a studio that was founded on originality and art.”
Meanwhile. Alexander Williams and Dave Bossert both like Favreau’s version. “Overall, I thought the film stands on its own,” said Bossert who did visual effects throughout the movie. “It not only showcases a great story again, but it’s an homage to the original film.”
Williams, who worked on the initial Scar, said it’s none of his concern whether they want to remake it or not because “I think some of my colleagues forget that when you work on a Disney movie, you don’t own it. They own it. You get paid to work there, which is a great privilege.”
The 2019 remake has been well received by audience and has already made already made$1 billion at global box office.

‘Hobbs & Shaw’ finishes in first place at box office with $60 million,"
The big-budget spinoff, starring Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, is expected to be an even bigger draw overseas, where the action franchise is hugely popular. Hobbs & Shaw kicked off internationally with a robust $120 million for a global start of $180 million. 
Though standalone vehicles aren’t always as muscular as official franchise sequels, Hobbs & Shaw will have to lure crowds across the globe throughout the dog days of summer to justify its sizable $200 million budget. The Fast & Furious series has generated over $5 billion worldwide across eight films.
“We’re very thrilled with the global release, a tremendous start with a big market like China still to come,” said Jim Orr, Universal’s president of domestic distribution.

 Opening weekend crowds skewed expectedly male, with boys and men accounting for nearly 60% of tickets sold. Hobbs & Shawenticed moviegoers young and old, as 50% of audiences were over the age of 25. Those who showed up this weekend were high on the action and thrills, awarding the film with an A- CinemaScore and a 90% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
Or attributes the film’s “very broad appeal” directly to Jonhson and his massive fanbase.
“[Director] David Leitch, The Rock and Jason Statham created an original and really thrilling adventure that complements the franchise tremendously well,” he said.
Its $60 million domestic opening weekend marks the biggest bow for Johnson and Statham’s careers outside of the main Fast & Furious franchise. The $180 million figure also represents Universal’s fifth-highest grossing global launch ever, behind The Fate of the Furious, Jurassic World, Furious 7 and Fifty Shades of Grey.
In Hobbs & Shaw, the first spinoff in the Fast & Furious universe, Johnson’s Luke Hobbs and Statham’s Deckard Shaw unite to take down a genetically enhanced anarchist (Idris Elba). The star-studded cast also includes Helen Mirren and Vanessa Kirby. David Leitch, known for his work on Deadpool 2, directed the film, which was written by “Fast” vets Chris Morgan and Drew Pearce.
Despite the new nationwide release, Sony and director Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood had a strong second weekend in theaters, placing third on domestic box office charts. The R-rated drama with Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie collected $20 million, marking a 51% decline from its inaugural outing. After 10 days of release, Once Upon a Time in Hollywoodhas made $78 million in North America.
Meanwhile, reigning champ Disney’s The Lion Kingslid to the No. 2 spot with a solid $38 million. The hyperrealistic remake — directed by Jon Favreau — is the fourth Disney movie this year to cross $400 million in domestic ticket sales. With $430 million in North America and $1.19 billion internationally, “The Lion King” is now the second-biggest film of the year both domestically and globally.
Sony’s Spider-Man: Far From Homelanded in fourth place, generating $7.7 million to boost its North American haul to $360 million. The web-slinging superhero sequel has made $1.08 billion worldwide, including $715 million at the international box office.
Rounding out the top five is Disney’s Toy Story 4 with $7.2 million, taking the animated pic to $410 million at the domestic box office.
Elsewhere, indie box office favorite The Farewellcontinues to fare well as it slowly expands to theaters across the country. A24’s comedic drama landed at No. 7, pocketing $2.4 million from 409 venues. The film, starring Awkwafina and directed by Lulu Wang, has amassed $6.8 million to date.
Also at the specialty box office, Neon’s drama Luce brought in $132,916 when it debuted in five locations. Naomi Watts and Octavia Spencer lead the movie, which was directed by The Cloverfield Paradoxfilmmaker Julius Onah.
As the end summer moviegoing season nears, domestic ticket sales are still down over 6% from last year, according to Comscore. Unless there’s a surprise hit in coming weeks, the North American box office might be free of blockbusters until Warner Bros. “It Chapter Two” scares some life into theaters in September.

Hairdressers are willing to help customers detect skin cancers,"
Most hair stylists at salons and barber shops may be interested in getting trained to detect skin cancers on the scalp, face and neck, researchers say.
Since hairdressers see a customer’s head and neck skin up close and regularly, they’re able to look for unusual spots or changes that could be melanoma, the study authors write in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.
“Hairdressers are uniquely positioned to be part of screening teams to find skin cancers early. People are more loyal to them than most other professions,” said Dr. Suephy Chen of Emory University in Atlanta, senior author of the study.

 “Previous studies have shown that hairdressers are willing and eager to do this,” she told Reuters Health by email. “They want to be taught by dermatologists.”
Chen and colleagues surveyed stylists at 15 salons within a 30-mile radius of Emory in fall 2017 and received 229 completed surveys from 12 salons. Questions included whether the hair professionals ever checked clients for skin lesions, had a client who asked them to check for skin lesions, or had referred a client to a doctor for an abnormal mole.
The survey also asked hairdressers for reasons why they might not check for skin lesions, as well as whether stylists should be trained in skin cancer detection and the best way to offer such training. Among the respondents, 82% were women, 86% were white and 97% estimated that more than half of their customers were white.
The research team found that 93% of hairdressers wanted to learn more about skin cancer detection and 73% believed stylists should receive skin cancer detection training, but only 40% thought it should be required for certification as a hair professional.
Less than one quarter of stylists had received a request from a customer to check for skin lesions, yet more than half had referred a customer to a doctor to check an abnormal mole. About 40% said they rarely or never checked for skin lesions.
Overall, hairdressers said the top reasons they don’t check for lesions are: they lack training; they don’t have the confidence to recognize lesions; they’re unsure about the appropriate steps to take; and they don’t feel comfortable bringing up skin cancer with their customers. Hairdressers who had discussed skin cancer with clients were twice as likely as those who hadn’t to agree with detection training.
“Several patients have come to me and said their hairdresser or barber pointed out a mole or freckle, so they wanted to make an appointment, and at least half a dozen have been diagnosed with melanoma of the scalp from that experience,” said Dr. Neda Black of the Comprehensive Dermatology Center in Pasadena, California, who wasn’t involved in the study.
Although scalp melanoma is less common than melanoma in other locations on the body, it’s often more severe and fatal because patients don’t notice dark spots or abnormalities on their heads, she said. Those who are active outdoors should get checked, especially since sun protection products aren’t typically marketed for or used on the scalp.
“My first patient who had this was a 30-year-old man who had just gotten married,” Black said in a phone interview. “We were able to cure him, but he would have died if his hairdresser hadn’t caught it.”
The Skin Cancer Foundation recently launched an education program called “Heads Up!” that promotes salon-held training sessions for skin cancer surveillance. Groups such as EyesonCancer.org have also started initiatives to train beauty professionals about different types of cancer, including massage professionals and nail salon aestheticians.
“Clients shouldn’t be shy about asking their hairdresser to check for anything abnormal,” Black noted. “About 99% of hairdressers feel honored to be asked and are willing to take a look.”

Measles surveillance lags in US workplaces,"
Monitoring for measles in U.S. workplaces needs improvement, especially in the healthcare sector, an occupational safety expert argues.
Measles cases have reached a 27-year high in the U.S. To help prevent transmission, officials need to more closely monitor how and where the cases spread, Christopher Brown, a health scientist in the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), writes in a letter published in the American Journal of Infection Control.
“Good disease surveillance . . . is critical to allow for effective interventions that reduce or stop disease spread and keep people healthy,” Brown told Reuters Health by email, noting that he wrote the research letter out of his own personal interest, not in his official capacity with OSHA.

 During past measles outbreaks, Brown writes, work-acquired infections were common and could have been prevented, especially among healthcare workers.
For example, about 2% of the 1,300 non-imported U.S. cases recorded between 2001 and 2014 were linked to occupational exposures among healthcare workers. Between 1998 and 2010, healthcare workers made up about 23% of cases associated with 31 different outbreaks worldwide. This includes three U.S. outbreaks.
The CDC’s National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System monitors the spread of outbreaks, but the numbers don’t typically include details related to occupational exposures, Brown said.
Local and state health departments should try to report this information, and the CDC should, in turn, make the information available publicly so researchers can track exposures and infection patterns, he said. This type of surveillance is done for high-consequence diseases such as Ebola but not for outbreaks that aren’t considered “novel or clinically severe,” Brown said.
“For individuals who work in a setting where they might have an increased risk of being exposed to measles, it is important for them to make sure they have the recommended number of doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine,” said Amy Parker Fiebelkorn of the CDC Vaccine Task Force, who wasn’t involved in the letter.
“For adults who are healthcare personnel, international travelers, and students in post-secondary educational institutions, the recommendation is for two MMR doses,” she told Reuters Health by email. “For all other adults, one dose of MMR is sufficient. MMR vaccination is the best prevention against measles.”
Since the beginning of this year, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has logged more than 1,100 measles cases, which represents a 300% increase over 2018, Brown writes in the letter.
Some of the cases have led to outbreaks in New York State, California, Pennsylvania and Washington.
“Large outbreaks of measles are occurring globally right now, and in this mobile world, it can be brought into the U.S., which becomes contagious among the pockets of unvaccinated people,” said Dr. Jennifer Rosen of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, who wasn’t involved in the letter.
“The first case in the New York City outbreak was an unvaccinated child who acquired measles while traveling abroad, which led to several other cases,” she told Reuters Health by phone. “Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself from getting measles.”

Yellow lens glasses don’t improve drivers’ night vision,"
Touted to improve nighttime eyesight, yellow lens glasses don’t help drivers see better and may, in fact, worsen vision, a new study suggests.
Researchers found that yellow-lens wearing volunteers operating a driving simulator were no better at spotting a pedestrian when confronting oncoming headlights than those who wore clear lenses, according to the study published in JAMA Ophthalmology. And there was a suggestion that the yellow tinted lenses might even be making the situation worse.
Buyers of these products “have the concept that somehow these magic glasses can improve nighttime driving,” said the study’s lead author, Alex Hwang, an instructor in ophthalmology at the Harvard Medical School and an investigator at the Schepens Eye Research Institute at Massachusetts Eye and Ear. “Wearing (tinted) glasses, whether they are yellow, red or blue, cuts out a chunk of light. Which means this is the same as wearing sunglasses while driving at night.”

 Hwang’s advice: “Don’t waste your money on these kinds of glasses for night driving.”
Despite there being no evidence of effectiveness, yellow-lens glasses are sold widely, Hwang noted.
An ad for one brand of yellow-lens glasses sold on Amazon claims that “night vision glasses help reduce night driving glare and eye strain, yellow lenses help to enhance night vision, improve color clarity and optical definition, enable to see better when driving at night or cloudy, rainy days, making night driving safer and easier.”
To determine whether yellow-lens glasses could actually improve drivers’ night vision, Hwang and his colleagues set up an experiment using a specially designed driving simulator that included the option of bright oncoming headlights.
The researchers recruited 22 volunteers who, wearing either one of three brands of yellow-lens glasses or clear glasses, completed a total of eight night driving scenarios, each of which lasted about 10 minutes. Of the 22, 18 were younger, with an average age between 27 and 28, while the other four, all men, had an average age of 70.
During the experiment, volunteers were told to press the horn as soon as they saw a pedestrian. Pedestrians were clad in either a dark blue navy shirt or an orange shirt. In some runs, the volunteers were subjected to bright headlights and in others they were “driving” in the dark.
While glare from headlights did seem to slow the speed with which the younger group spotted the pedestrian, wearing yellow-lenses did not improve things. In fact, the yellow lenses appeared to slow their response time, but that finding was not statistically significant. The findings were similar among the older volunteers, but their overall response time was slower than that of the younger volunteers both with and without the yellow lenses.
Dr. Douglas Frederick hopes drivers take note of the findings. “The biggest issue is that we don’t want people to have a false sense of security because they are using something that does not (improve vision),” said Frederick, deputy chair of education in the department of ophthalmology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai/New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. “Motor vehicle accidents involving pedestrians are a common problem.”
An important secondary finding is that “older people are more sensitive to headlight glare compared to younger people,” said Robert Masoff, a professor of ophthalmology at the Johns Hopkins Eye Institute and author of an editorial that accompanied the new study. “This is a real problem that needs to be addressed.”
The reason older people are more sensitive to bright headlights is that “changes occur in people’s lenses with aging,” Masoff said. Those changes lead to more glare, he explained. “Glare can cover up what you’re trying to see. It’s like having a dirty windshield.

Seven in DR Congo Ebola scare placed under surveillance: WHO,"
Seven relatives of a gold miner who died of Ebola in eastern DR Congo have been placed under surveillance as a precaution, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday.
The seven had sparked a scare on Wednesday after travelling from the city of Goma in North Kivu province to the town of Birava in neighbouring South Kivu — a province that has so far escaped the year-old epidemic.
The group were initially placed in quarantine along with eight people who had come to welcome them, but on Thursday South Kivu Governor Theo Ngwabidje Kasi told the press that the 15 had tested negative for Ebola.

 The WHO said the seven, comprising a woman and six of the man’s children, had now been taken back from Birava to Goma.
They have been placed under surveillance with other relatives of the dead patient.
“All seven were vaccinated and brought back to Goma. We put them up in a hotel last night and today we put them in an apartment to keep them there for monitoring,” Dr Boubacar Diallo, coordinator of Ebola surveillance for WHO, told AFP.
“So far none of the seven has displayed any symptoms.”
The miner, who died on Wednesday, was the second Ebola fatality in Goma, the capital of North Kivu province that is the epicentre of the outbreak.
The two deaths, occurring in a major transport hub and a border city of two million people, deepened fears the epidemic could leapfrog to neighbouring countries.
The miner’s wife and one of his daughters have been infected with Ebola and are being treated in a Goma hospital, according to Congolese authorities.
Diallo said the authorities had already traced 282 people who had had contact with the three cases in this family and “almost all” high-risk contacts had been identified.
The epidemic, which broke out in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo on August 1 2018, has left 1,823 dead, according to health ministry figures released Friday.
The WHO has elevated the outbreak to a global health emergency.
Health experts are especially worried when a contagious disease breaks out in a city.
In an urban setting, density of population, anonymity and high mobility make it far harder to isolate patients and trace contacts compared to the countryside.
The Ebola virus causes fever, vomiting and severe diarrhoea, often followed by kidney and liver failure, internal and external bleeding.
The disease is spread by contact with infected body fluids and is fought with laborious techniques of tracing contacts and quarantining them.
The latest epidemic is the second deadliest on record after more than 11,000 people were killed in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia between 2014-2016.

Doctors extract 526 teeth from boy’s mouth,"
CHENNAI: Indian doctors removed a tumor with a record number of 526 teeth inside a seven-year-old boy’s mouth, the medical team in Chennai said on Friday.
The 200 gram (7 ounce) growth was lodged in the boy’s lower right jaw, said Senthilnathan P., a doctor at Saveetha Dental College and Hospital, where the operation was performed.
“He had come to us complaining about a swelling in his jaw,” Senthilnathan told Reuters, saying the boy had a history of swelling since he was three.

 “It was a benign tumor, which we removed and found that it was embedded with hundreds of unerupted teeth,” he added of the operation last month, saying Indian doctors believed the number of teeth was a global medical record.
A tumor with unerupted teeth is typically a genetic condition that can also be in some cases caused by external factors such as trauma to a tooth, the doctor said. “The boy recovered very well and got discharged in three days,” he added.
