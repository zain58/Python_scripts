Fresh migrant stand-off with Italy’s Salvini,"
ROME: A charity rescue ship run by German NGO Sea-Eye was blocked outside Italian territorial waters on Thursday with 40 migrants on board, after Italy’s far-right interior minister banned it from entering.
The migrants on the Alan Kurdi ship, rescued Wednesday off Libya, hail from West Africa and include a pregnant woman, three young children and a man with gunshot wounds, according to Sea-Eye.
There were also two survivors of a bombing of a Tripoli detention centre that killed dozens of migrants in July, it said.

 Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who has taken a hard line against migrants entering the country, said the rescue was a “provocation” and accused the crew of behaving “in a petty fashion”.
Meanwhile two other charity ships were set to provide another challenge to Salvini, who is also deputy prime minister.
On Thursday the Spanish migrant rescue charity Proactiva Open Arms ship rescued 52 people, including 16 women and two babies, found adrift in a boat that was taking on water and in danger of capsizing midway between the Libyan coast and the Italian island of Lampedusa.
Meanwhile the Norwegian-flagged Ocean Viking, operating for Humanitarian groups SOS Mediterranee and Doctors and Without Borders (known by its French initials MSF), was preparing to set sail for the zone off the Libyan coast where migrants have frequently been rescued.
‘This is blackmail’
The Alan Kurdi ship sailed north from Libyan waters overnight and came to a stop off Lampedusa on Thursday.
Salvini says the rescue operation took place much closer to Tunisia than Lampedusa, so those saved should be taken there.
But rights campaigners say Tunisia cannot be considered a “safe port” because it has repeatedly blocked migrants at sea before repatriating them, without giving them time to apply for asylum.
The minister blocked an Italian coast guard ship off Lampedusa last week, only letting the migrants disembark in Sicily on Wednesday after a deal with the Italian church and five European countries to take them.
On Thursday Salvini said that the German government had told the European Commission that unless the 40 migrants onboard the Alan Kurdi were allowed to disembark in Italy it would not take in a group of 30 migrants it had already promised to accept.
“This is real blackmail,” said Salvini. “It confirms that other European countries consider Italy as their refugee camp, but things have changed and we no longer accept orders and invasions.”
There was no immediate word from Berlin on Salvini’s accusation.
During its last rotation off Libya in early July, the Alan Kurdi rescued 109 migrants and disembarked them in Malta.
A few days earlier, the Sea-Watch — another German charity — forcibly landed migrants in Lampedusa after deciding those rescued posed a danger to themselves and others after a lengthy stand-off at sea.
Captain Carola Rackete was arrested but it was overturned by a court, however the ship was seized as part of a police investigation.

Calls for justice for Zimbabwe protesters shot after election,"
HARARE: Zimbabwe’s government came under fire on Thursday for failing to bring to justice soldiers who killed six people and injured dozens in post-election protests a year ago.
Soldiers opened fire on August 1, 2018 on unarmed demonstrators protesting a delay in the release of the July 2018 election results – fatally shooting six and wounding 35 more.
The shootings triggered international outrage and undermined the new administration’s attempts to break away from the brutality of ex-president Robert Mugabe’s rule.

 In a statement marking the anniversary of the killings, Amnesty International said there was enough media evidence to identify the soldiers who used live ammunition on the protesters.
“If the Zimbabwean government wants to demonstrate that it is committed to human rights, it needs to ensure that the wheels of justice start turning faster than they have done over the past year,” said Muleya Mwananyanda, Amnesty International’s deputy director for Southern Africa.
“The tragedy of the post-election shootings is compounded by the fact that no one in the army suspected to be responsible for the bloodshed has been held to account for these brutal killings,” she said.
An inquest into the fatal shooting of the six people blamed the military and police, saying the use of live fire was “unjustified and disproportionate”.
The Canadian embassy in Harare on Thursday tweeted, calling on the government “to fully implement recommendations of the …inquiry”.
US ambassador to Harare Brian Nichols said in a statement “unfortunately” over seven months after the inquiry report was released, government had done “very little” to apply the recommendations.
“I have yet to learn of a single soldier or security forces member held to account for the deaths of civilians as the report clearly mandated,” he said.
Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took over from long-time autocrat Mugabe, went into the July 2018 elections vowing to revive Zimbabwe’s economy, end cash shortages, mend fences with former western allies and lure foreign investors.

Russian ‘mass unrest’ probe arrests five amid opposition crackdown,"
MOSCOW: Russian investigators said Thursday they had detained five people as part of a criminal probe into mass unrest, in an apparent attempt to crush a wave of peaceful protests demanding fair elections.
The investigation into mass unrest, a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison, and violence against police, came after thousands of people protested in Moscow last week against the exclusion of opposition candidates from local elections.
Authorities launched the clampdown as opposition politicians are fighting to get on the ballot for a Moscow parliament election in September amid anger over worsening living standards which has dented President Vladimir Putin’s approval ratings.

 The investigators said Thursday more than 10 people had been identified who helped organise and participated in an unauthorised rally in central Moscow on Saturday.
Five participants have been detained including Alexei Minyaylo, a well-known activist and aide to Lyubov Sobol, an independent politician who has fought to get on the ballot.
‘We will win’ 
Minyaylo’s apartment was searched in the middle of the night, he said in a Facebook post.
“Let them come, I am not afraid,” he said ahead of his detention, urging Muscovites to continue protesting. “We will win.”
Sobol, 31, said she considered Minyaylo’s arrest pressure against her. “I will not give up and will continue to stand for our rights,” she said on Twitter.
Sobol, who is a close ally of jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny, has been refusing food for 19 days to protest her exclusion from the September election.
Minyaylo has been on hunger strike in solidarity with her.
Also on Thursday, the general director of liberal channel TV Rain, Natalia Sindeeva, said tax authorities had launched a probe into the media outlet.
TV Rain removed its paywall to give Russians access to live coverage of the July 27 protest and other news.
Almost 1,400 people were arrested on Saturday.
Nearly all prominent opposition leaders and many independent would-be candidates were detained ahead of the rally and jailed for up to 30 days, but many of the others have since been released.
The opposition denies widespread unrest, insisting that the rally was peaceful and that police used violence against protesters, not the other way around.
Corruption accusation
The probes are part of the largest crackdown on dissenters since 2012, when thousands of people protested against Putin’s return to the presidency after four years as prime minister.
More than 30 people were prosecuted in connection with the 2012 clashes and most of them were sentenced to prison terms of between two to three years on average.
This week, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin thanked riot police for breaking up the rally and accused the opposition of seeking to stage a power grab.
“This is not Zimbabwe,” he added.
In a new investigation, Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Fund on Thursday accused the Moscow mayor’s first deputy of corruption.
The report alleged that Natalia Sergunina, 40, had sold Moscow property at knock-down prices to her close relatives.
According to the Anti-Corruption Fund, Sergunina’s family now controls property worth 6.5 billion rubles ($101 million) including a two-million-euro mansion in Vienna.
There was no immediate comment from Sergunina or the mayor’s office.
Sobol has called on Russians to take part in a peaceful “walk” in central Moscow on Saturday.
More than 17,000 people on Facebook have expressed interest in that rally despite the threat of new violence.
Liberal newspaper Vedomosti said that pressing ahead with the crackdown now would be more dangerous for the authorities than in 2012 as more people were prepared to take part in protests.
The newspaper urged officials to allow opposition candidates to run in the September 8 polls to defuse the political crisis.

U.N. chief says world will lose brake on nuclear war with end of INF treaty,"
NEW YORK: United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is concerned by rising tensions between nuclear-armed states, warning “the world will lose an invaluable brake on nuclear war” with the expiration of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) on Friday.
“This will likely heighten, not reduce, the threat posed by ballistic missiles,” Guterres told reporters. “Regardless of what transpires, the parties should avoid destabilizing developments and urgently seek agreement on a new common path for international arms control.”
Barring a last-minute decision by Russia to destroy a new medium-range missile that NATO says violates the INF, the United States is set to pull out of the accord on Aug. 2, arguing that it needs to develop its own warheads to deter Moscow.

 Moscow says it is fully compliant with the treaty, negotiated by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, which eliminated the medium-range missile arsenals of the world’s two biggest nuclear powers.
The breakdown of the treaty, the latest in a growing list of East-West tensions, is of grave concern because medium-range rockets would allow Russia to launch a nuclear attack on Europe at very short notice, Western experts and officials say.
Read More: Risk of nuclear war now highest since WWII, says UN expert
“I strongly encourage the United States and the Russian Federation to extend the so-called New Start agreement to provide stability and the time to negotiate future arms control measures,” Guterres said.
The 2011 New START treaty, a U.S.-Russia arms control pact which limits deployed strategic nuclear weapons, is set to expire in February 2021 but can be extended for five years if both sides agree.
Guterres also said he was “troubled by growing friction” between the economies of the United States and China. He warned of the possible “emergence of two competing blocs – each with their own dominant currency, trade and financial rules, their own internet and artificial intelligence strategy, and their own contradictory geopolitical and military views.”
The United States and China have levied billions of dollars of tariffs on each other’s goods in a year-long trade war, disrupting global supply chains and roiling financial markets.

US to slap 10% tariff on $300 bn more in Chinese goods: Trump,"
WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump announced Thursday he will hit China with punitive tariffs on another $300 billion in goods, escalating his trade war after accusing Beijing of reneging on more promises.
The sudden deterioration meant the world’s two largest economies have now erected trade barriers covering virtually all of their $660 billion in annual two-way merchandise trade — a prospect that confirmed economists’ fears and sent shudders through Wall Street.
The 10 percent duties will take effect September 1, and come on top of the 25 percent tariffs on $250 billion in imports already in place.

 Trump said on Twitter that Beijing had agreed “to buy agricultural product from the US in large quantities but did not do so.”
“Additionally, my friend President Xi said that he would stop the sale of fentanyl to the United States — this never happened, and many Americans continue to die!” Trump said, referring to the highly potent and addictive opioid.
After resuming face-to-face talks in Shanghai this week, trade negotiators were set to reconvene in Washington in early September for another round of discussions, just after the new tariffs take effect.
Up to now, US officials had worked prevent tariffs from hitting popular consumer items but the duties will soon cover the vast expanse of everyday Chinese-made goods and consumer electronics — mobile telephones, baby carriages, tampons, watches and toys.
While other parts of the US economy have begun to slow, the dominant retail sector has been a bright spot, helping bolster growth despite the general slowdown in most other industrialized nations.
Wall Street dove into the red following Trump’s announcement, with retailers, hit particularly hard. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.1 percent shortly after 1900 GMT.
Even so, Trump seemed upbeat: “We look forward to continuing our positive dialogue with China on a comprehensive Trade Deal, and feel that the future between our two countries will be a very bright one!”
US-China trade talks this year have alternated between progress and disaster, appearing to collapse in May only to be revived two months later after a meeting in Japan between Trump and Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart.
American officials accused Beijing of reneging on core commitments they had previously made during the talks.
Trump says China has used a state-directed economic model to harm the American economy, unfairly subsidizing production and stealing intellectual property.
But economists say the trade war has increasingly undermined the global manufacturing sector and sapped business sentiment, threatening the world’s economy at a time when it is already on the wane.

Iran says it’s ready for worst in battle to save nuclear deal in standoff with U.S.,"
DUBAI: President Hassan Rouhani said on Thursday Iran was ready for the worst in an uphill struggle to salvage its nuclear deal with world powers abandoned by the United States, but that he was sure Tehran would eventually prevail.
Fears of a Middle East war with global repercussions have risen since President Donald Trump withdrew last year from the 2015 deal and revived a panoply of sanctions meant to push Tehran into wider security concessions.
Iran has retaliated by breaching the deal, resuming uranium enrichment seen in the West as a potential conduit to developing an atom bomb, but faces severe economic damage under intensified U.S. sanctions designed to strangle its vital oil trade.

 “We have a hard battle ahead, but we shall surely win,” Rouhani said on live state television.
“We are not acting on the assumption we will get results through talks and accords,” Rouhani said, alluding to European powers trying to salvage the deal that reined in Iran’s disputed nuclear advances but unable to protect from U.S. sanctions the trade benefits that Tehran was promised in return.
“Instead we are planning based on the assumption that we will not achieve results. Our budget for this year and next, our ministries are also acting on this basis…We are acting and going step-by-step with long-term prudence.”
The downbeat remarks by Rouhani, architect of the landmark 2015 accord and a strong proponent of negotiations, hinted he was losing hope of avoiding a final collapse of the deal, though he left the door open to further contacts with Europe.
ATTACKS ON OIL TANKERS
After several attacks in May and June on oil tankers – blamed by Washington on Tehran, which denied responsibility – U.S. President Donald Trump has been trying to forge a military coalition to secure Gulf waters, though European allies have been loath to join for fear of provoking open conflict.
Britain, France and Germany have instead appealed for diplomatic moves to defuse the crisis. But longtime foes Tehran and Washington have taken hard lines and on Wednesday the Trump administration slapped sanctions on Iran’s foreign minister in an effective rebuff to European calls for direct dialogue.
“They (Americans) are resorting to childish behaviour… They were claiming every day ‘We want to talk, with no preconditions’…and then they sanction (our) foreign minister,” Rouhani said earlier on state television.
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, a pivotal player in the nuclear deal who was educated and lived for years in the United States, said the U.S. action would not affect him as he had no property or other interests in America.
U.S. AFRAID OF ZARIF’S WORDS, IRAN SAYS
“A country which believes it’s powerful and a world superpower is afraid of our foreign minister’s interviews,” Rouhani said, referring to numerous interviews that Zarif – a fluent English speaker – gave to American media when he visited New York for a United Nations conference in July.
“If they’re serious about negotiations, who other than (our) foreign minister can be their interlocutor?” Rouhani added.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Zarif was being sanctioned because he “implements the reckless agenda of Iran’s Supreme Leader…(We are) sending a clear message to the Iranian regime that its recent behaviour is completely unacceptable”.
In repudiating the nuclear deal reached by his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump said he wanted to secure a more far-reaching accord that would not only put stricter limits on Iran’s nuclear activity but also curb its ballistic missile program and end its support for armed proxies in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon.
Iran has long said its nuclear work is solely for civilian energy and its missiles only for defense and deterrence.
NO SWAP OF SEIZED TANKERS, BRITAIN SAYS
As U.S.-Iranian tensions have spiraled, the security of shipping in the Gulf, through which about a fifth of the world’s oil passes, has shot up the international agenda.
Washington has accused Iran of being behind explosions that holed six oil tankers in May and June.
In July, Iran seized a British-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, the Gulf’s outlet to the open seas, in apparent retaliation for Britain’s seizure of an Iranian ship accused of violating European sanctions by taking oil to Syria.
Britain on Thursday ruled out a swap of the two tankers. “We are not going to barter: if people or nations have detained UK-flagged illegally then the rule of law and rule of international law must be upheld,” Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said.
In a sign of increasing jitters over security in the Gulf, Royal Dutch Shell said on Thursday it was not taking any British-flagged tankers through the Strait of Hormuz for the time being.
The U.S. Embassy in Berlin said on Tuesday the United States had asked Germany to join France and Britain in a mission to protect shipping through the strait and “combat Iranian aggression”. Germany rejected the request.
“To join the American position, which in our view is part of a strategy of maximum pressure, has never been the right path for us and will not be in the future,” Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told Germany’s ZDF television.
On Thursday, Richard Grenell, U.S. ambassador to Germany, urged Berlin to take on a global responsibility to match its economic might. “Germany is the biggest economic power in Europe. This success brings global responsibilities,” he said.

English town evacuated after water cascades through damaged dam,"
WHALEY BRIDGE: Police evacuated thousands of residents from an English town on Thursday after torrents of water cascaded from a nearby reservoir after a dam was damaged, with officials warning that subsequent flooding posed a risk to life.
Footage posted on social media showed water gushing from the Toddbrook Reservoir which sits above Whaley Bridge in Derbyshire, central England.

Police said the wall of the reservoir had been damaged with locals told to leave the town, home to about 5,000 residents, and take pets and any medication they needed with them.
“Residents who have been at work, or away from the Whaley Bridge area, are strongly advised to stay away from the area following advice from the Environment Agency who have indicated that the incident currently poses a significant threat to life,” Derbyshire Police said.
Britain’s Environment Agency issued a severe flood warning for the area, saying river levels in the River Goyt which runs through the town could rise rapidly.

“We understand that there will be some concern around not being able to return home, however, our priority is to ensure people are kept safe and well and are not taking unnecessary risks,” a police spokesman said.
“This is not a decision that has been taken lightly and we appreciate that there is significant impact on this community, however, this is an unprecedented, fast-moving, emergency situation.”
The evacuation comes after heavy rain in the last couple of days led to flash floods in areas across northern England causing bridges to collapse and road closures. Britain’s Met Office said on Wednesday downpours had led to 50 mm (2 in) of rain falling in just one hour.

Mogadishu’s mayor dies in Qatar,"
MOGADISHU: The mayor of Somalia’s capital Mogadishu has died of wounds sustained in a suicide bomb attack on his office, government officials said on Thursday. He died in Qatar where he had gone for treatment after the attack.
Abdirahman Omar Osman was a naturalised Briton who returned to Somalia to help rebuild the war-torn country after serving as a councillor for the Labour party.
He sustained serious injuries when a suicide bomber from the al Shabaab militant group struck while a meeting was being held at the municipal government headquarters last week, killing six senior local government officials.

 Officials said the mayor had been airlifted to Qatar for treatment together with nine others.
“The Mogadishu mayor has died today in Qatar. May Allah rest his soul. The other injured ones are still being treated there in Qatar,” Saleh Omar Hassan, the spokesman for Mogadishu local government, told Reuters.
President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed declared three days of mourning for the mayor, ordering that flags be flown at half-mast.
Al Qaeda-linked militant group al Shabaab, which aims to topple Somalia’s UN-backed government, has carried out several attacks against government and civilian targets.
Osman had previously served as Somalia’s information minister, a post he had been appointed to in 2010. He became mayor of Mogadishu last year.

"Hong Kong charges 44 protesters with rioting, grants bail","
HONG KONG: More than 40 people appeared in a Hong Kong court on Wednesday charged with rioting for their role in a recent protest that turned violent when thousands of activists clashed with police near Beijing’s main representative office in the city.
A wave of protests that began in late April have plunged the former British colony into its biggest political crisis since its return to Chinese rule in 1997, but this is the first time that the authorities in the financial hub have resorted to using the rioting charge.
The 44 charged had been arrested after a peaceful gathering on Sunday in a park in the city’s central business district rapidly morphed into running battles between thousands of black-clad demonstrators and police, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas.

 The use of the anti-riot law could infuriate activists who have been demanding that the government avoid using the term “riot” to refer to the demonstrations. Under Hong Kong law, rioting is defined as an unlawful assembly of three or more people where any person “commits a breach of the peace”, and a conviction can carry a 10-year prison sentence.
Most of the defendants were released on bail of HK$1,000 (US$128). The court also imposed a curfew from midnight to 6 am on most of them, and many were ordered to remain in Hong Kong.
Those charged included 13 students, seven clerks, a pilot from the city’s main airline, Cathay Pacific, teachers, nurses, workers and salesmen. All were released on bail and are due back in court on Sept 25.
“The Chinese government just wants to scare people not to go out and protest again,” another supporter named Syrus, 19, said outside the court.
“It will deter some of us.” Hundreds of people surrounded a police station late on Tuesday after the 44 activists were charged, and on Wednesday morning, hundreds gathered outside the courthouse, chanting “revolution of our time” and “liberate Hong Kong”.
Even with a typhoon approaching the city and rain lashing down, many of them huddled beneath umbrellas, stayed on to show solidarity.
“I’m not scared to protest. This whole thing today is just making me angrier,” said Gartner, a 21-year-old protester outside the court who declined to give his full name.
The protests were triggered by an extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to the mainland for trial but they have now evolved into a broader backlash against the city’s government and its political masters in Beijing.
Besides calling for the extradition bill to be scrapped, rather than its suspension so far, protesters have also demanded the resignation of city leader Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into the police’s handling of the crisis and the unconditional release of all those arrested.
Since mid-June the protests have escalated and become more frequent, at times shutting government offices, blocking roads and disrupting business as some of the demonstrations degenerated into violent clashes between activists and police.
At a demonstration outside Tin Shui Wai police station in the early hours of Wednesday, the occupants of a passing car fired fireworks into the crowd, injuring six people, police said. There were no immediate arrests, but police issued a statement that “strongly condemned” the attack.
China’s Liaison Office, a potent symbol of Beijing’s rule over the city since Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997, has become a target for growing ranks of increasingly emboldened youngsters, angry at China’s tightening grip on the city’s freedoms.
Under a “one country, two systems” formula adopted as part of China’s sovereignty, the city was promised wide-ranging freedoms denied citizens in mainland China.

US to slap 10% tariff on $300 bn more in Chinese goods: Trump,"
WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump announced Thursday he will hit China with punitive tariffs on another $300 billion in goods, escalating his trade war after accusing Beijing of reneging on more promises.
The sudden deterioration meant the world’s two largest economies have now erected trade barriers covering virtually all of their $660 billion in annual two-way merchandise trade — a prospect that confirmed economists’ fears and sent shudders through Wall Street.
The 10 percent duties will take effect September 1, and come on top of the 25 percent tariffs on $250 billion in imports already in place.

 Trump said on Twitter that Beijing had agreed “to buy agricultural product from the US in large quantities but did not do so.”
“Additionally, my friend President Xi said that he would stop the sale of fentanyl to the United States — this never happened, and many Americans continue to die!” Trump said, referring to the highly potent and addictive opioid.
After resuming face-to-face talks in Shanghai this week, trade negotiators were set to reconvene in Washington in early September for another round of discussions, just after the new tariffs take effect.
Up to now, US officials had worked prevent tariffs from hitting popular consumer items but the duties will soon cover the vast expanse of everyday Chinese-made goods and consumer electronics — mobile telephones, baby carriages, tampons, watches and toys.
While other parts of the US economy have begun to slow, the dominant retail sector has been a bright spot, helping bolster growth despite the general slowdown in most other industrialized nations.
Wall Street dove into the red following Trump’s announcement, with retailers, hit particularly hard. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.1 percent shortly after 1900 GMT.
Even so, Trump seemed upbeat: “We look forward to continuing our positive dialogue with China on a comprehensive Trade Deal, and feel that the future between our two countries will be a very bright one!”
US-China trade talks this year have alternated between progress and disaster, appearing to collapse in May only to be revived two months later after a meeting in Japan between Trump and Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart.
American officials accused Beijing of reneging on core commitments they had previously made during the talks.
Trump says China has used a state-directed economic model to harm the American economy, unfairly subsidizing production and stealing intellectual property.
But economists say the trade war has increasingly undermined the global manufacturing sector and sapped business sentiment, threatening the world’s economy at a time when it is already on the wane.

BMW says it can shift production to Europe if Brexit results in no deal,"
FRANKFURT: BMW’s Chief Executive on Thursday said the German carmaker can move more production of its Mini to a plant in the Netherlands if Britain fails to strike a trade deal with the European Union after its exit from the common market.
“We are very flexible and we could adjust volumes at Oxford and at Nedcar in the Netherlands,” Harald Krueger told analysts in a call to discuss the company’s second-quarter results.
BMW said contract manufacturer VDL Nedcar had produced 211,660 cars in the Netherlands last year, a 39% increase in production, assembling the BMW X1 the Mini hatch, Mini convertible and Mini countryman models.

 By contrast, Oxford made 234,501 Mini vehicles last year.
VDL Nedcar employs around 6,000 workers working in car assembly, compared with just over 4,500 people building Mini’s in Oxford.

BP forms Chinese venture to build electric-vehicle charging hubs,"
LONDON: BP said on Thursday it would build a network of electric-vehicle charging hubs in China with China’s Didi Chuxing as the British firm bets on the world’s largest market for such cars to help profits during the transition from oil to cleaner fuels.
Retail services, such as convenience stores at petrol stations, have become a big revenue generator for oil majors such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell with profits often offsetting weakness in oil and gas production.
BP operates a fuels and convenience business across 18 countries with more than 18,700 sites. Didi, China’s biggest ride-hailing company, runs a mobile transportation platform, offering users app-based options including car-sharing.

 Didi’s platform has 550 million users and more than 600,000 EVs run on it in China, BP said.
The venture with BP will develop charging hubs for Didi’s drivers and the wider public and add convenience stores in the near future, BP said in a statement.
The venture could build as many as 200 hubs with multiple charging points by the end of 2020, a BP spokesman said.
BP believes the venture can be scaled up to thousands of hubs across China to reach a leading market position with unmanned and remotely controlled sites, separate from BP’s roughly 700 retail sites in the country, the spokesman added.
“As the world’s largest EV market, China offers extraordinary opportunities,” BP quoted its downstream chief, Tufan Erginbilgic, as saying.
“The lessons we learn here will help us further expand BP’s advanced mobility business worldwide, helping drive the energy transition and develop solutions for a low-carbon world.”
China is the world’s largest EV market, with around 50% of battery electric vehicles globally.
In January, BP said it would invest in Chinese start-up PowerShare, which links EV drivers to charging points and helps power suppliers balance distribution.
With China targeting sales of more than 7 million EVs by 2025, the need to manage demand and distribution of power on the grid, particularly at times of peak demand, will be crucial.
Corporate investors from outside the auto industry are betting on electric vehicles, vying with automakers and suppliers to bankroll companies working on everything from advanced batteries to charging devices and all-new EVs.
In Europe, BP bought Britain’s top EV charging company Chargermaster last year, with the aim of linking the smaller firm’s services with BP petrol stations in the country.

‘Suffocating’ UK factories report biggest fall in output in seven years,"
LONDON: British manufacturers’ output fell by the most in seven years last month as Brexit worries and weaker global demand choked off growth, a closely watched business survey showed on Thursday.
Hours before the Bank of England is due to update its economic outlook, the monthly purchasing managers’ index (PMI) added to signs that the economy is at risk of slipping into recession as businesses battle falling demand from Europe and China and the risk of a disruptive no-deal Brexit.
July’s IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI remained at the six-and-a-half-year low of 48.0 it struck in June, a shade better than the median forecast of a fall to 47.7 in a Reuters poll of economists.

 But the survey’s output component fell further below the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction to 47.0, its lowest since July 2012 when the euro zone was in the throes of a debt crisis.
“July saw the UK manufacturing sector suffocating under the choke-hold of slower global economic growth, political uncertainty and the unwinding of earlier Brexit stockpiling activity,” IHS Markit economist Rob Dobson said.
New Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31, regardless of whether he can secure a revised transition deal with the bloc, pushing sterling to its weakest since November 2016 against a basket of currencies GBPTWI=BOEL.
Businesses fear a no-deal Brexit would lead to major disruption at ports following the reimposition of tariffs and customs checks, and IHS Markit said foreign customers were already reducing their reliance on British firms.
“Clients delayed, cancelled or re-routed orders away from the UK, leading to a further decline in new work intakes from both domestic and overseas markets,” Dobson said.
Britain’s car industry said on Wednesday that investment fell by more than 70% in the first half of 2019 due to Brexit worries. The Confederation of British Industry said small manufacturers were the gloomiest since the 2016 Brexit referendum.
Brexit has compounded broader problems affecting Europe’s manufacturing industry, which has suffered from reduced Chinese demand as a by-product of U.S. tariffs on imports from China.
A euro zone flash manufacturing PMI for July fell to its lowest since 2012 and growth in the currency bloc sank to 0.2% in the second quarter from 0.4% at the start of the year.
The Bank of England predicts British economic growth will sink to zero in the second quarter from 0.5% in the first three months of 2019, when growth got a boost as businesses rushed to stockpile goods before the original Brexit date of March 29.
July’s survey showed manufacturers’ stock levels were fairly stable as some businesses continued to run them down while others started to build up again ahead of the new Oct. 31 deadline.
Businesses also reported the weaker pound was pushing up the cost of some imports, though overall raw material costs rose at the slowest rate in three years, as did the prices manufacturers sold their goods at.

No-deal Brexit preparations to cost UK extra £2.1 billion,"
LONDON: Britain said it is ramping up preparations for a no-deal Brexit by spending an extra 2.1 billion pounds to stockpile medicines, hire more border officials and fund one of the biggest peacetime advertising campaigns.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who took power last week, has pledged to leave the trading bloc without an agreement in three months unless the EU agrees to renegotiate the deal agreed by his predecessor Theresa May.
In his first major policy announcement, new finance minister Sajid Javid said the outlay will allow the government to increase training for customs officials, hire more staff to deal with an expected increase in passport applications, and improve infrastructure around ports.

 “With 92 days until the UK leaves the European Union it’s vital that we intensify our planning to ensure we are ready,” Javid said. “We want to get a good deal that abolishes the anti-democratic backstop. But if we can’t get a good deal, we’ll have to leave without one.”
Wrenching the United Kingdom out of the EU without a deal means there would be no formal transition arrangement to cover everything from post-Brexit pet passports to customs arrangements on the Northern Irish border.
Many investors say a no-deal Brexit would send shock waves through the world economy, tip Britain into a recession, roil financial markets and weaken London’s position as the pre-eminent international financial centre.
Supporters of Brexit say that while there would be some short-term difficulties, the disruption of a no-deal Brexit has been overplayed and that in the long-term, the United Kingdom would thrive if it left the European Union.
“TURBO-CHARGE NO-DEAL”
The finance ministry, which said the new money will “turbo-charge” no-deal preparations, will provide an immediate cash boost of 1.1 billion pounds and make a further 1 billion pounds available for government departments and the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
This means the government has in total allocated 6.3 billion pounds to prepare for a no-deal exit, including 4.2 billion pounds of funding for this financial year.
The finance ministry said, among other initiatives, 434 million pounds will be spent to ensure vital supplies of medicines and medical products can be brought into the country, including hiring additional freight capacity, warehousing and stockpiling.
To get people and businesses ready for a no-deal Brexit, 138 million pounds will be spent on one of the biggest peacetime advertising campaigns and provide extra consular support for citizens living overseas.
A total of 344 million pounds will be spent on new border and customs operations, including hiring an extra 500 border force officers and doubling the support for customs agents to help companies fill in customs declarations.
Javid’s predecessor Philip Hammond, who opposed leaving the EU without a divorce deal, was accused by Brexit supporters of failing to spend enough money to get Britain ready for a no-deal Brexit, undermining its negotiating position with Brussels.
The main opposition Labour party branded the spending an “appalling waste of taxpayers’ cash” because the majority of lawmakers in parliament had made clear their intention to block an exit without a withdrawal agreement.
“This government could have ruled out no deal, and spent these billions on our schools, hospitals, and people,” said John McDonnell, the party’s finance chief.
Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak rejected those claims.
“It is my job to make sure that we spend taxpayers’ money wisely, the good news here is a lot of this money and a lot of this investment is things we need to do in all cases because we are leaving the European Union,” he said.
“What we are doing is accelerating the urgency of when we spend that money and making sure it is spent now.”
He said more detail on the government’s spending plans would be given at a spending review and fiscal event later in the autumn.

"US, China to hold more trade talks after ‘constructive’ meeting","
US and Chinese negotiators agreed to meet again in the United States in September after holding “frank” and “constructive” talks in Shanghai on Wednesday, state media said following meetings overshadowed by aTwitter tirade fromPresident Donald Trump.
US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer met with Vice Premier Liu He in the Chinese financial hub for the first face-to-face negotiations since atrade war trucewas declared last month.
“The two sides conducted frank, highly efficient and constructive in-depth exchanges on major issues of common interest in the economic and trade field,” according to the officialXinhuanews agency, adding that the purchase of US agricultural goods by China was discussed.

 The White House likewise called the talks “constructive” and said on Wednesday that Chinese officials “confirmed their commitment” to buy more US farm exports, which would offer some relief to the American industry badly battered in the trade conflict.
The White House statement said the two sides also discussed central US grievances, including intellectual property rights and trade barriers other than tariffs.
“The meetings were constructive and we expect negotiations on an enforceable trade deal to continue” in Washington in early September, the statement said.
Washington and Beijing have so far hit each other with punitive tariffs covering more than $360 billion in two-way trade in a row focused on demands for China to curb the alleged theft of American technology and provide a level playing field to US companies.
The negotiators shook hands and exchanged pleasantries when they met on Wednesday morning and then held talks for around four hours behind closed doors.
The talks were relatively brief and the negotiators emerged a little earlier than expected, for a group photo before the US trade officials left for the airport without speaking to reporters.

US scientists announce 3D heart printing breakthrough,"
Washington: US scientists have successfully built functional heart parts out of collagen using a 3D bioprinter, a breakthrough they say could one day create entire organs.
Their technique, which was described in the journal Science on Thursday, replicates the body’s own complex biological scaffolds that provide the structure and biochemical signaling organs need to function.
“What we were able to show was you can actually 3D print a heart valve out of collagen, and they function,” Adam Feinberg, one of the paper’s co-authors told AFP.

 Previous attempts at printing these scaffolds, known as extracellular matrices, had been hindered by limitations that resulted in poor tissue fidelity and low resolutions.
Collagen, which is an ideal biomaterial for the task since it is found in every tissue of the human body, starts out as a fluid and attempting to print it resulted in a puddle of jello-like material.
But the scientists at Carnegie Mellon University were able to overcome these hurdles by using rapid changes in pH to cause the collagen to solidify with precise control.
“That’s the very first version of a valve, and so anything that we engineer as a product will actually get better and better,” Feinberg said.
“I think more near term is probably patching an existing organ,” such as a heart that has suffered a loss of function through a heart attack, or a degrading liver, said Feinberg.

Japan approves growing human organs in animals for first time,"
Scientists in Japan will begin trying to grow human organs in animals after receiving government permission for the first study of its kind in the country.
The cutting-edge — but controversial — research involves implanting modified animal embryos with human “induced pluripotent stem” (iPS) cells that can be coaxed into forming the building blocks of any part of the body.
It is the first step in what researchers caution is a very long path towards a future where human organs for transplant could be grown inside animals.

 The research led by Hiromitsu Nakauchi, a professor of genetics at Stanford University, is the first of its kind to receive government approval after Japan changed its rules on implanting human cells into animals.
Japan had previously required researchers to terminate animal embryos implanted with human cells after 14 days and prevented the embryos from being placed into animal wombs to develop.
But in March those restrictions were dropped, allowing researchers to seek individual permits for research projects.
“It took nearly 10 years, but we are now able to start the experiment,” Nakauchi told AFP.
The research involves generating animal embryos — mice, rats or pigs — that lack a particular organ such as a pancreas.
The modified embryos are then implanted with human iPS cells that can grow into the missing pancreas.
The embryos would be transplanted into wombs where they could theoretically be carried to term with a functioning human pancreas.

BP forms Chinese venture to build electric-vehicle charging hubs,"
LONDON: BP said on Thursday it would build a network of electric-vehicle charging hubs in China with China’s Didi Chuxing as the British firm bets on the world’s largest market for such cars to help profits during the transition from oil to cleaner fuels.
Retail services, such as convenience stores at petrol stations, have become a big revenue generator for oil majors such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell with profits often offsetting weakness in oil and gas production.
BP operates a fuels and convenience business across 18 countries with more than 18,700 sites. Didi, China’s biggest ride-hailing company, runs a mobile transportation platform, offering users app-based options including car-sharing.

 Didi’s platform has 550 million users and more than 600,000 EVs run on it in China, BP said.
The venture with BP will develop charging hubs for Didi’s drivers and the wider public and add convenience stores in the near future, BP said in a statement.
The venture could build as many as 200 hubs with multiple charging points by the end of 2020, a BP spokesman said.
BP believes the venture can be scaled up to thousands of hubs across China to reach a leading market position with unmanned and remotely controlled sites, separate from BP’s roughly 700 retail sites in the country, the spokesman added.
“As the world’s largest EV market, China offers extraordinary opportunities,” BP quoted its downstream chief, Tufan Erginbilgic, as saying.
“The lessons we learn here will help us further expand BP’s advanced mobility business worldwide, helping drive the energy transition and develop solutions for a low-carbon world.”
China is the world’s largest EV market, with around 50% of battery electric vehicles globally.
In January, BP said it would invest in Chinese start-up PowerShare, which links EV drivers to charging points and helps power suppliers balance distribution.
With China targeting sales of more than 7 million EVs by 2025, the need to manage demand and distribution of power on the grid, particularly at times of peak demand, will be crucial.
Corporate investors from outside the auto industry are betting on electric vehicles, vying with automakers and suppliers to bankroll companies working on everything from advanced batteries to charging devices and all-new EVs.
In Europe, BP bought Britain’s top EV charging company Chargermaster last year, with the aim of linking the smaller firm’s services with BP petrol stations in the country.

San Diego duo takes on electric scooter industry,"
SAN DIEGO: Two men in San Diego have impounded thousands of electric scooters they say have been left littered about the city and endangering pedestrians, sparking a battle with companies that have flooded cities with the two-wheelers.
John Heinkel, 55, and Dan Borelli, 43, operate a small outfit called ScootScoop. They use a flatbed truck to tow away scooters they say have been left improperly around hotels or other private properties.
In just over a year of operations, they have impounded more than 12,500 electric scooters, Borelli said. The electric scooter companies Bird and Lime have responded by suing them in California state court and accused them of unlawfully taking their vehicles.

 
The battle between the men and the scooter companies underscores the chaotic legal landscape for the vehicles, which are the same size as toy scooters that many people rode as children but are powered by an electric motor.
Cities in the United States and Europe have struggled with how to regulate the scooters, amid complaints from some residents and businesses that they clutter sidewalks when parked and endanger pedestrians when driven.
A dozen electric scooter companies have received more than $1.5 billion in investments in total, according to a report issued earlier this year by Boston Consulting Group.
Borelli describes ScootScoop as a start up in its own right, with he and Heinkel the only full-time employees. Like many start-ups, ScootScoop is not yet profitable.
Most of the scooters the firm has impounded in San Diego are from Bird and Lime, but those companies are refusing to pay to retrieve their vehicles and are fighting ScootScoop in court through their lawsuits, Borelli said.
‘DEMANDING RANSOM’
Bird in a statement said ScootScoop was “unlawfully impounding micro-mobility devices and demanding a ransom for their return.”
“We are seeking an immediate end to their scheme as the company is robbing people of the environmentally friendly scooter options they’ve come to rely upon each day to get to and from work, as well as to local businesses,” the company said.

Lime in a statement said ScootScoop has repeatedly taken scooters that are “responsibly parked.”
“Their attempts to deputize themselves as an extension of the city is not only unlawful, but it is nothing more than a property theft scheme to generate income,” Lime said.
ScootScoop claims the right to impound scooters under California law when they are improperly parked on private property, and it invoices the scooter companies at least $50 per vehicle to return them, Borelli said. ScootScoop plans to auction off some scooters if it doesn’t get paid.
With Bird and Lime refusing to pay, the scooters sit in ScootScoop’s compound, but not silently. As ScootScoop’s truck drove away with a load of them last week they emitted a chorus of chirping sounds designed to scare off potential thieves.
San Diego city leaders earlier this year approved regulations for electric scooters that require companies to obtain permits and comply with new rules, such as ensuring that in the downtown area the scooters are only parked in certain designated “corrals.”
Borelli and Heinkel said they are not personally opposed to scooters in San Diego, California’s second-largest city.
“We don’t want to turn it into a war,” Borelli said. “We want to see co-existence. We want to see the scooter survive.”

Facebook fact-checker says company must share more data to fight misinformation,"
SAN FRANCISCO: One of Facebook’s third-party fact-checking partners said the company needed to share more data with fact-checkers to better curb misinformation.
UK-based charity Full Fact, which joined the program in January, issued a report urging Facebook to provide more data on how flagged content is shared over time, to see how quickly false information is spreading and assess how fact-checks are containing the spread.
The charity, which said it had earned $171,800 from fact-checking Facebook content between January and June, also raised concerns about the effectiveness of Facebook’s machine-learning approaches for identifying potentially false content.

 Facebook launched the program in December 2016 and now has 54 fact-checking partners working in 42 languages.
Under the system, fact-checking partners rate content with labels and Facebook then downgrades the distribution of certain items. Facebook also adds fact-checkers’ articles to a story’s “Related Articles” and notifies users if they try to share or have previously shared a false story.

Julia Bain of Facebook’s integrity partnerships team said the social media network was evolving its rating scale to account for different types of misinformation and working on improving the impact of fact-checks by identifying similar or identical content.
“We are encouraged that many of the recommendations in the report are being actively pursued by our teams,” Bain said in a statement to Reuters.
Although Full Fact said it still thought the program was worthwhile, it echoed statements from other partners that Facebook was not sharing enough data that they could use to evaluate their fact-checks.
Eugene Kiely, director of FactCheck.org, recently told Reuters that he “couldn’t make heads or tails” of a report the organization received last December.
“We haven’t really received anything from Facebook that would provide evidence one way or the other to the effectiveness,” he added.
A Facebook spokeswoman told Reuters that fact-checking partners receive quarterly reports.
Full Fact also called for the program to be expanded to Instagram, so that fact-checkers could directly check content on the platform. In May, the company started using image-detection to find content debunked on Facebook and removing it from Instagram’s Explore tab and hashtag search results.

Explainer: What do you do after a data breach?,"
A hacker has stolen the personal information of over 100 million people from Capital One Financial Corp, the company said this week, in the latest high-profile breach of sensitive consumer data.
Security experts say data breaches will continue to happen as cyber criminals and state-backed hackers target the protected information held by companies and government agencies.
Such attacks leave consumers vulnerable to fraud and identity theft. Here are some steps you can take to assess the severity of the breach and better secure yourself:

 WHAT WAS COMPROMISED?
Breaches often cover a wide range of data. Information which is already publicly available, such as your name or email address, is seen as less of a concern.
Other details, however, can be extremely sensitive and need to remain private. For example, full credit card numbers, which could be used to make fraudulent purchases in your name, or passwords for your online accounts.
Even if stolen, the data may still be protected by encryption. Hacks by foreign governments are also usually seen as less dangerous for general consumers compared to data thefts by financially-motivated criminal gangs because most spy agencies do not sell or trade such information.
Much of the information stolen from Capital One was already public, including names and addresses of over 100 million people in the United States and Canada. But the breach also included 140,000 Social Security numbers which could be used to steal people’s identities.
To assess the severity of the breach, try and determine what information was compromised and in what format it was stolen.
AM I AFFECTED?
Try to establish if your data is likely to have been compromised in the breach. Are you a customer of the affected company? Do you know what data they hold on you? Does the breach only concern data collected in a specific time period?
Answering those questions will allow you to judge the level of risk, but remember some organizations may hold your data without you being aware. Those include credit-reporting companies such as Equifax Inc, which suffered a breach in 2017 that affected 147 million people.
Breached companies are usually obliged to notify the people who are impacted, but this does not always happen immediately. Affected companies will typically post guidance for consumers on their own websites about data breaches.
Under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), companies have to inform victims of severe data breaches “without undue delay.” They must then describe in “clear and plain language” the nature of the breach, the likely consequences and what measures being taken to deal with it.
IS THIS A SCAM?
If you think you data was compromised, be on high alert for scams and fraud.
Watch your bank account balances and payment card statements carefully, especially if you believe your financial information has been compromised. If you spot any unusual activity, contact your bank or card provider immediately and inform the appropriate law enforcement agency.
Be aware of so-called “phishing” websites purporting to offer information about the breach, or even compensation, but actually set up by criminals to try and trick you into revealing more personal details or making a payment to the wrong account.
Fraudsters may also contact you directly, by phone or email, and could now be armed with large amounts of detailed personal information which will make them harder to spot. If you’re unsure about someone’s identity, find the affected company’s contact information and contact them independently.
Experts recommend changing passwords frequently and using a combination of letters, characters and symbols to maintain a complex passphrase that is less likely to be guessed.

Watchdog warns of perils of unregulated cryptocurrencies,"
LONDON: Britain’s markets watchdog said on Wednesday that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value and offer consumers few protections, but added that such coins fall outside the scope of its powers.
The Financial Conduct Authority said crypto markets were highly dysfunctional, with the onus on consumers to understand the risks associated with investing in unregulated assets.
“A combination of market immaturity, volatility, and a lack of credible information or oversight raises concerns about market integrity, manipulation and insider dealing within cryptoasset markets,” the FCA said in a statement.

 Despite those flaws, the FCA said existing rules did not apply to bitcoin and other tokens such as second-biggest coin ethereum, or to firms like exchanges and trading platforms.
The watchdog was laying out which aspects of the nascent crypto industry it regulates — a milestone in Britain’s regulation of a sector that still forms a tiny part of the broader financial system but which has attracted strong retail investor following.
“We have some concerns around some of the harms that consumers can be exposed to,” Nick Cook, FCA director of innovation, told Reuters, adding that investment by British consumers in crypto was still fairly low.
The FCA said its guidance will inform Britain’s finance ministry as it looks at whether new laws are needed for cryptocurrencies.
The finance ministry said in an emailed comment that the guidance was welcome and that it was planning to consult on unregulated cryptocurrencies later this year.
Retail investors across the world have been drawn to cryptocurrencies, highly volatile assets that unlike fiat money or other assets usually lack guarantees, because of their potential for quick gains.
Other proponents say digital coins could transform payments and how companies raise capital, though such examples are rare.
The treatment of cryptocurrencies by regulators is in focus after Facebook unveiled plans for its Libra coin, sparking a backlash by politicians and regulators across the globe.
G7 finance ministers and central bankers said last month that Libra and other digital currencies raise serious concerns and must be regulated as tightly as possible to ensure they do not upset the world’s financial system.
While the FCA did not mention Libra in its guidance, it said that some “stablecoins” — a form of cryptocurrency, like Libra, backed by assets such as fiat currencies — could fall under its rules in certain circumstances.
The FCA could not say how Libra would be treated because its structure, design and operating model were still to be determined, Cook said.
Other types of cryptocurrencies, such as security tokens — coins that provide rights and obligations such as shares or units in funds — were subject to rules, the FCA said. As such, firms issuing them would need authorization.
CryptoUK, an industry body, called for further clarity.
“Britain’s cryptoasset sector is a key part of the UK fintech industry but needs regulatory certainty to reach its full potential,” chair Iqbal Gandham said in a statement.
PATCHWORK OF RULES
Currently cryptocurrencies are subject to a patchwork of rules that vary from country to country.
Regulators in Britain, the European Union and the United States have looked at how they can apply existing securities, anti-money laundering and consumer protection rules before considering new regulation.
Others, such as China, have banned cryptocurrencies outright. An Indian government panel last week recommended a similar measure.
A handful of smaller countries, from Belarus to Bahrain, have come up with specific laws for digital currencies. Their efforts could help shape the development of the global market and the growth of industry players, from exchange platforms to brokers.
The FCA said it would work closely with other national and international regulators to coordinate approaches.
For now, said Bradley Rice, a lawyer at law firm Ashurst, there was little it could do within its existing powers.
“The FCA’s hands are tied. If the UK wants to bring more crypto assets into the regulatory net, the law has to be changed, and that is in the Treasury’s gift,” he said, referring to Britain’s finance ministry.

Apple’s iPhone sales drop to less than half of quarterly revenue,"
Apple iPhone sales dropped to less than half of quarterly revenue for the first time in seven years, but CEO Tim Cook on Tuesday described the change as successfully diversifying away from a single product and forecast results above Wall Street targets.
That strategy proved especially useful in China, the world’s largest smartphone market. Investors feared a drumbeat of negative shipment data from the Chinese government and analysts meant problems for the iPhone maker.
Apple’s greater China sales, which had gone into a near free fall earlier this year, dipped only slightly, assuaging concerns that trade tension were undermining Apple’s standing in one of its most important markets. Shares rose 4.25% after hours.

 Moribund global mobile phone sales have led Apple to focus on accessories like the Apple Watch and growth in music, apps, gaming, video and a credit card coming in August. In mainland China, Cook said the overall number of Apple device users had grown in the fiscal third quarter, helping to increase the market for its services, whose sales were up by more than 10% there.
“We actually grew in mainland China,” Cook told Reuters. “Non-iPhone revenue grew 17%. We grew in every category outside of iPhone.”
But globally, iPhone sales fell 12% to $25.99 billion, after dropping 17% in the previous quarter, and matched Wall Street targets.
Wearables and other accessories revenue rose nearly 50%, topping expectations.

Services revenue rose 12.6% to $11.46 billion, slowing and slightly missing expectations but setting a new record.
Apple said it expects revenue for the current fiscal fourth quarter of between $61 billion and $64 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $61.02 billion. At the high end of Apple’s forecasted range, sales would beat the prior year’s $62.90 billion in sales, despite the fact that analysts expected continued lackluster iPhone sales until 5G models arrive in 2020.
For the fiscal third quarter ended in June, Apple reported a 1% rise in revenue to $53.8 billion and a 7% drop in earnings per share to $2.18, compared with expectations of $53.39 billion and $2.10 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said he was pleasantly surprised to see iPhone sales declines slow down versus the prior quarter.
“You really don’t hear people talk about their phones like they did several years ago,” Eddins said. But, “the key is that when people want to splurge on a phone, they do it with an Apple product.”
Apple did not give the number of active Apple devices, but in January it said it was 1.4 billion, with 900 million of those being iPhones. Investors used the number, called the installed base, as a proxy for how many subscribers it can gain for its services business. Cook told investors on a conference call Tuesday that Apple has 420 million paid subscribers to its own services and third-party apps. The company has set a goal of 500 million by 2020.
Trip Miller, managing partner at Apple shareholder Gullane Capital Partners, said he wants to see services growth return to the 20% range and thinks Apple needs to use its billions in cash to buy media properties to fuel its forthcoming television service.
“You have to have a bigger installed base and have services that people get value from,” Miller said.

Google builds gesture controls into new Pixel phone,"
SAN FRANCISCO: Google revealed that it is building gesture controls and face recognition into a next-generation Pixel smartphone as it looks to fuel early enthusiasm for its upcoming flagship handset.
The Pixel 4 is expected to make its debut in October, along with a new iPhone as competitors strive to win or keep fans in the competitive, cooling smartphone market.
The two new Pixel features teased by Google were billed as representing a “next step” in the internet giant’s vision for a future in which computing power is available anywhere when people want without having to think about it.

 Alphabet-owned Google said the key technology would center around its motion-sensing radar called “Soli.”
“Pixel 4 will be the first device with Soli, powering our new motion sense features to allow you to skip songs, snooze alarms, and silence phone calls, just by waving your hand,” Pixel product manager Brandon Barbello said in an online post.
“These capabilities are just the start, and just as Pixels get better over time, motion sense will evolve as well.”
Google’s advanced technology and projects team has worked on Soli, a motion-sending radar, for the past five years, according to Barbello.
Along with recognizing hand gestures, Soli will cue facial recognition sensors when a Pixel 4 is picked up to allow devices to automatically unlock for their owners.
“Face unlock uses facial recognition technology that is processed on your device, so that image data never leaves your phone,” Barbello said.
“The images used for face unlock are never saved or shared with other Google services.”
Soli sensor data is also kept on smartphones and not shared with other Google services, according to Barbello.
Google, Apple and other smartphone rivals typically launch new premium models ahead of the year-end holiday shopping season. A Samsung event in early August is expected to reveal its new Note handset.

Katy Perry and record label hit with $2.7 million copyright judgment,"
LOS ANGELES: A Christian rapper was awarded $2.7 million on Thursday by a Los Angeles jury that found that Katy Perry’s 2013 hit Dark Horse contained a musical passage from one of his songs.
The verdict, reported by Los Angeles City News Service, followed a copyright trial in which Marcus Gray, known as Flame, said the beat in his song Joyful Noisewas lifted and used in Perry’s single.
The jury last week ruled that the short passage in the two songs was identical.

 Perry, who was not in federal court for the damages decision, testified last month that she believed “Dark Horse” was an original work. The song was created by her producers and writers after she was presented with a series of short instrumental passages, the pop star testified.
Her attorney said she would appeal.
“The writers of `Dark Horse’ consider this a travesty of justice,” attorney Christine Lepera told reporters outside the court, City News reported.
“Dark Horse” brought in about $31 million for record label Capitol Records, a unit of Universal Music Group, attorneys for both sides agreed during the trial. Perry earned about $3.2 million.
On Thursday, Capitol Records was ordered to pay $1.2 million in damages to Gray, while Perry was ordered to pay $550,000. Producers and other collaborators on the song were told to pay the balance of the $2.7 million award.
Flame, 37, from St. Louis, Missouri, released his first album in 2004 and has had several hits on the Billboard gospel and Christian charts, but is little known outside of that genre.
Perry, 34, rose to fame in 2008 with the single I Kissed a Girl and went on to become one of the best-selling female pop stars in the world. She was also a judge for three seasons of the TV talent show American Idol.

Woodstock 50 music festival called off,"
LOS ANGELES: The troubled Woodstock 50 anniversary music festival planned for August was officially cancelled on Wednesday, with organizers blaming a series of “unforeseen setbacks.”
The three-day festival, meant to mark the 50th anniversary of the famed 1969 celebration of peace and music, was planned for Aug. 16-18.
“Woodstock 50 today announced that the three-day festival to celebrate its 50th anniversary has been cancelled,” the organizers said in a statement.

 “We are saddened that a series of unforeseen setbacks has made it impossible to put on the festival we imagined with the great lineup we had booked and the social engagement we were anticipating,” said Michael Lang, one of the original producers of the 1969 event.
The cancellation was widely expected after a troubled five months in which organizers were turned down at two proposed sites in upstate New York, lost funding and headliners including rapper Jay-Z and pop star Miley Cyrus pulled out.
Tickets never went on sale for the festival.
Organizers last week made a last ditch attempt to put on a free, scaled down event at an amphitheater in Maryland, but several of the 80 or so acts began pulling out despite having already been paid.
Lang said in his statement that the smaller event in Maryland would have been aimed at raising funds for non profits fighting climate change and organizations encouraging Americans to vote in the 2020 U.S. general elections.
Woodstock 50 was first planned for the Watkins Glen motor racing venue in upstate New York, but the site pulled out in June. Organizers then attempted in vain to seek permits in Vernon, New York.
The nonprofit Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, the current owner of the field where the 1969 Woodstock festival took place, also scaled back plans earlier this year for a three-day anniversary event. It will instead host separate concerts by Ringo Starr, Santana and the Doobie Brothers.
“My thoughts turn to Bethel and its celebration of our 50th Anniversary to reinforce the values of compassion, human dignity, and the beauty of our differences embraced by Woodstock,” Lang said in his statement on Wednesday.

Prince Harry plans only two children out of concern for planet,"
Snippets from Duke of Sussex’s Vogue interview reveals that Prince Harry plans to have just one more child because of his concerns about the environment.
In a conversation with the famed British primatologist, Jane Goodall , he said “Two maximum”. The interview will be published in British Vogue’s September issue which is guest-edited by his wife Meghan Markle in a first.


“We are the one species on this planet that seems to think that this place belongs to us, and only us,” Prince Harry said.
“Surely, being as intelligent as we all are, or as evolved as we all are supposed to be, we should be able to leave something better behind for the next generation,” the 34-year-old royal said reflecting on preserving the world for the next generation.
According to a research by Lund University in Sweden, a parent who chooses to have one child less would reduce their CO2 emissions by 58.6 tonnes a year during their lifetime; over 25 times more than from any other action.
The Duke of Sussex became a proud father of Prince Archie Harrison on May 6, who is seventh in the line of succession to the British throne.

"In a first, Miss Venezuela ditches contestants’ measurements","
For the first time in its history, the Miss Venezuela contest will not publish the 24 contestants’ waist, bust and hip measurements, organizers said — as Pageants face criticism for their primary focus on physical appearance.
The event, which will take place in Caracas on Thursday, has been running since 1952 and has an enviable record on the international stage, having produced seven Miss Universe winners and six in Miss World.
Traditionally, the contestants’ vital statistics have been publicized — with a 90-centimeter (36- inch) bust, 60-centiment waist and 90-centimeter hips long considered the ideal.

 This year, contestants will still parade on stage in swimsuits and evening gowns, but organizers say they want to fight stereotypes about what an ideal woman looks like and hence will not reveal their measurements.

“A woman’s beauty isn’t 90, 60, 90 … It is measured by each one’s talent,” said Gabriela Isler, the pageant’s spokeswoman and Venezuela’s last Miss Universe winner in 2013.
At past pageants, presenters would tell the audience the exact size of each contestant, many of whom underwent cosmetic surgery and followed strict diets in a bid to achieve the supposedly ideal physique.
Miss Venezuela is normally big business in the crisis-wracked Latin American country, but it is suffering from the same difficulties as the rest of the population.
One of those is frequent blackouts, the latest of which hit the country on July 22.
Isler revealed that the pageant did not have enough money to put in place contingency measures in case of a power outage on Thursday.

Photo captures sea lion falling into mouth of whale,"
In a stunning photo, a wildlife photographer has captured a sea lion falling into the mouth of a humpback whale in what he calls a “once-in-a-lifetime” moment.
Chase Dekker, who is also a marine biologist, took the spectacular shot during a whale-watching boat trip off the coast of Monterey Bay, in California, last week.
“I get to see a lot of crazy stuff but never this,” said the 27-year-old who has been taking pictures of wildlife for nearly a decade.

Just the other day I witnessed something out on Monterey Bay I had never seen before. While the humpbacks were lunge feeding on a school of anchovies, a sea lion apparently didn’t jump out of the way fast enough and got trapped inside the whales mouth! At some point the sea lion escaped and the whale seemed fine too as it continued to feed, but it must have been a strange experience for both parties! That sea lion had the true “Jonah Experience”!
A post shared by  Chase Dekker Wild-Life Images (@chasedekkerphotography) on Jul 24, 2019 at 10:13am PDT



He said he was on a whale-watching boat trip on July 22 when he noticed a group of humpback whales on a feeding frenzy.
As the animals were munching on anchovies, an unlucky sea lion failed to get out of the way in time and ended up inside the whale’s mouth, Dekker recounted in interviews and an Instagram post.
He said he quickly grabbed his camera and began snapping pictures of the incredible moment.
“I was ecstatic because I captured a moment I may never see again,” he said.
But rest assured, Dekker said, the whale never closed its jaws on the sea lion which was probably very shaken by the experience but managed to swim away.
“That sea lion had the true ‘Jonah Experience’,” he said on Instagram.

Thailand set to deliver first batch of medical marijuana,"
BANGKOK: Thailand plans to distribute about 10,000 bottles of cannabis oil next week for hospital patients, a government official said on Thursday, the first official use of medical marijuana since a law legalizing it came into effect this year.
The Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) will deliver 4,500 5ml bottles of cannabis oil to the Ministry of Public Health to be distributed to hospitals on Aug. 7 for about 4,000 registered patients, GPO executive managing director, Withoon Danwiboon, told a news conference.
The remaining 5,500 bottles will be gradually distributed later.

 Thailand, which has a tradition of using cannabis to relieve pain and fatigue, has legalized marijuana for medical use and research to help boost agricultural incomes.
Cannabis oil will be used to treat patients who suffer from nausea from chemotherapy, epilepsy, and aches and pains, Withoon said, adding that patients with Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and in palliative care would also benefit.
The GPO will begin planting its second crop of cannabis plants later this month and by early 2020, it plans to expand production to greenhouse cultivation and aims to produce 150,000-200,000 bottles of the oil.
“We have to speed up production because there is an under supply,” Withoon said.
For five years, foreign investors and imports of cannabis will be prohibited to allow the domestic industry to build up capacity and knowledge, he said.
Anutin Charnvirakul, a politician who campaigned for legalizing marijuana and is now health minister, said in a separate statement on Thursday that cannabis must only be used for medical purposes, not for recreational ones.
Steps would be taken to allow public health volunteers to grow cannabis at home for health benefits, but it would not be allowed to be sold.
A new civilian government has said it has made developing the medical marijuana industry a top priority to create economic opportunities in rural areas.

Can diet help cancer treatment? Study in mice offers clues,"

Diet is already a key part of managing diseases like diabetes and hypertension, but new research adds to a growing body of evidence that it could help cancer treatment too.
The study, published Thursday in the journal Nature, found restricting intake of an amino acid found in red meat and eggs significantly enhanced cancer treatment in mice, slowing tumour growth.

“These are very strong effects, and they are effects that are as strong as we would see with drugs that work,” said lead researcher Jason Locasale, an associate professor at Duke University’s School of Medicine.
“What this study is showing is that there are many situations where a drug by itself doesn’t work, but if you combine the drug with the diet, it works. Or the radiation therapy doesn’t work well, but if you combine… with the diet, it works well,” he told AFP.

 The study focused on restricting intake of the amino acid methionine, which is key to a process called one-carbon metabolism that helps cancer cells grow.
Methionine restriction has already been associated with both anti-aging and weight loss, but its importance to cancerous cells suggested it could also be a promising way to enhance cancer treatment.
‘Starving the cancer’
The researchers first tested methionine restriction in healthy mice to confirm it was having the desired effects on metabolism and then moved to testing it in mice with colorectal cancer and soft tissue tumours known as sarcomas.
They found that a low dose of chemotherapy, which on its own had no effect on colorectal cancer, led to “marked inhibition of tumour growth” when combined with methionine restriction.
Similarly, combining methionine restriction with radiation therapy in the case of the soft tissue sarcoma reduced tumour growth.
“You’re starving the cancer cells of certain nutrients, at a very basic level,” explained Locasale.
He cautioned that the results should not be extrapolated beyond the cancers tested so far, and that the research was far from being tested in humans.
“This is certainly not a be-all, end-all to cancer. This is not some panacea,” he said.
Independent experts also warned against reading too much into the study just yet.
“Before drawing any conclusions about the potential for dietary restriction as an approach to treating cancer, human studies are needed,” said Paul Pharoah, a professor of Cancer Epidemiology at the University of Cambridge.
‘Really exciting’
Locasale and his colleagues extended the research by testing a methionine-restricted diet in six healthy humans, and found that the effect on human metabolism appeared similar to that seen in mice.
That suggests that the diet could have a similar effect on certain tumours in humans, though Locasale warned it was far too early to draw any definitive conclusions.
And Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King’s College London, warned that “there is no evidence from this study to suggest following a vegan diet will help patients with cancer.”
Locasale said he hoped to eventually test the research in humans with cancer, but noted that nutrition research often struggles for funding because it proposes treatments that are not obviously profitable.
Still, he said the work adds to a body of research that suggests diet may play an important role in cancer treatment.
Last year, a study showed one type of chemotherapy drug was more effective in combination with a diet low in sugar and high in protein and fat. Other cancers appear to be better combated in combination with low-sugar diets alone.
“Research like this can lead to studies in people,” said Justin Stebbing, professor of cancer medicine and oncology at Imperial College London.
“How dietary interventions influence cancer… is likely to be really important in years to come.”
Locasale agreed, calling the field a “really exciting area right now… where we’re seeing that diet has a huge effect on human health.”
He hopes for a future where doctors will eventually be able to advise cancer patients to follow specific diets to assist their treatment.
“We’re not there yet, but the goal is to eventually get there.”

Trump administration opens door to importing medicine from Canada,"
The Trump administration took a first step on Wednesday toward allowing the importation of medicines from Canada, an action the president has advocated as a way to bring cheaper prescription drugs to Americans.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it and the Food and Drug Administration will propose a rule that will allow it to authorize states and other groups to pursue pilot projects related to importing drugs from Canada.
The agency also said that it would allow drugmakers to bring drugs that they sell more cheaply in foreign countries into the United States for sale here, potentially enabling them to sell below their contracted prices in the U.S.

 Drug industry shares were lower slightly, with the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index off 0.25 percent versus a broader flat market. Wall Street analysts said importation was far from being put into place and was limited to certain drugs from Canada.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said he has had prior discussion with Canada about importation and that it would be up to the states, pharmacies and distributors to address any hurdles.
“There are hurdles of course, but the hurdles now are known. They are being laid out and they are surmountable,” he said during a call with reporters.
Canadian officials were not immediately available for comment. Reuters has previously reported that Canada opposes any U.S. plans to buy Canadian prescription drugs that might threaten the country’s drug supply or raise costs for its own citizens.
Many drug purchase agreements in Canada forbid the re-export of drugs to other countries, according to a Canadian government memo obtained by Reuters.
“Given the size of the U.S. market and of large states such as Florida, which alone is two-thirds of the population of Canada, reliance on imports from Canada would have limited viability as a long term solution to the high cost of drugs in the U.S.,” Health Canada said in a statement on July 17.
Evercore ISI analysts Ross Muken and Michael Newshel said in a research note that any implementation is still far away given the technical steps of rule making and that the proposals will face challenges. For instance, he said, most Republicans in Congress oppose importation.
The first part of the proposal would allow states, wholesalers or pharmacists to submit plans for pilot projects for Canadian drugs if their raw materials are manufactured in the same plant as the U.S. version and are in line with the FDA’s approval. It would exclude biologics, infused drugs, injected drugs, inhaled drugs for surgery and certain parenteral drugs.
The Trump Administration has experienced several recent failures in its efforts to bring down drug prices. Its plans to make drugmakers disclose prices in TV ads had to be thrown out after it lost a legal battle with drugmakers, and it abandoned efforts to force pharmacy benefit managers to pass discounts onto Medicare recipients.
Drug pricing is an important election issue for Trump and also for Democrats, many of whom have said they would support importing medicines to lower U.S. drug prices. Pharmaceutical companies have opposed importing medicine.

A large number of doctors and surgeons found involved in tax evasion despite having registered with Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC), revealed in the FBR documents.
The revenue authority sent notices to the 30 major hospitals of Karachi in order to seek income details of doctors and surgeons along with their computerised national identity card (CNIC) numbers and names.

 Earlier in the day, it emerged that the number of taxpayers in Pakistan has increased by 700,000 over a year’s period, according to statistics shared by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).

As per the FBR’s stats, the total number of people who filed their tax returns rose by 700,000 to a total of 2.154 million. Of these, some 700,000 are salaried people.
The FBR further said proposals to impose fixed taxes were being mulled to bring the small and big business owners into the tax net.
Hailing the rise in numbers of people filing tax returns, Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry tweeted on Sunday that so far 2.1 million people had filed their tax returns, which was the highest in the FBR’s history.
“FBR has projected a target to enhance these returns numbers to 4 million for the tax year 2019,” he wrote.

Congo makes new push to fight year-old Ebola epidemic,"
An Ebola epidemic raging in eastern DR Congo marks its first year on Thursday in a mood of fear mingled with hope that fresh money and a change of leadership will turn the tide.
So far, 1,790 people have died of the dreaded haemorrhagic virus since the first cases were recorded on August 1 last year.
It is the second highest death toll from an outbreak in Ebola’s history, and the mortality rate is high — two-thirds of patients have died, against a historic average of 50 percent.

 Despite a campaign backed by the United Nations and international donors, doctors are struggling against an epidemic spreading with the help of mistrust, superstition and militia attacks.
In Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, the mood among many is frustration and despair.

“We are carrying out the guidelines, we respect the rules (about daily handwashing and checking temperatures), but what we want is for this epidemic to end quickly,” said Jonas Shukuru, a motorcycle taxi boss.

“The government has to make tackling it a priority — we don’t want to die both from lack of security and this epidemic.”
“The authorities have to assess what’s working in the response against Ebola — a whole year has gone by,” said John Banyene, a civil society leader.

Fears are high that the highly contagious virus will cross the Democratic Republic of Congo’s porous borders.
“Economic and human exchanges are very intense,” the Central African Republic’s health minister, Pierre Somse, warned last week.
“Our livestock farmers sell their cattle in DR Congo. Rebel groups and poachers go back and forth across the border. The risks are high.”

Money influx
The good news is that concerns about funding have eased since the UN’s World Health Organization (WHO) on July 17 declared the outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern,” a rare designation only used for the gravest epidemics.
The World Bank has already said it will contribute a further $300 million (269 million euros) in addition to $100 million it has already donated.
“Especially in the last couple of weeks there is renewed commitment to finance the shortages we were facing,” WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus said in the Nigerian capital Abuja on Saturday after holding talks with DR Congo President Felix Tshisekedi.
Beyond money, however, the anti-Ebola campaign faces hefty challenges on the ground.
Attacks on health workers have had a devastating effect.
Fighting Ebola is a labour-intensive operation — like a land war, it requires an army of personnel.
These workers provide hygiene advice or go door-to-door to trace people who have been in contact with Ebola patients. Clad in full-protection suits, they also care for the sick and bury the dead.
In a region where many people survive on just a few dollars a day, their recruitment has made them a target for jealousy and extortion, sometimes lethally so.
“They get threatened, including death threats,” a prevention worker hired by an international organisation told AFP.

“People say, ‘You are pocketing money from the fight against Ebola. Give me $2,000 — if you don’t have $2,000, we’ll shoot you’.”
Seven health workers have been murdered and more than 50 have been seriously hurt, according to an unofficial tally.
