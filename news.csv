Afghan delegates set to meet Taliban in Doha,"Afghanistan published on Tuesday a lengthy list of delegates who will meet with the Taliban in Doha this week, including government officials, in what could become the highest-level dialogue between the sworn enemies in years. A massive roster published by the presidential palace comprises 250 names, including President Ashraf Ghani’s chief of staff, Abdul Salam Rahimi, as well as his election running mate, Amrullah Saleh, the former head of Afghan intelligence. Other delegates named on the list come from many walks of Afghan life including youth leaders, tribal elders and — significantly — 52 women. The last time the Taliban met with the Afghan government was at secretive talks in Pakistan in 2015, which were quickly derailed by the news that Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar had died. The three days of talks in Qatar, scheduled to start on Friday, come amid a months-long push led by Washington for peace nearly 18 years after the US invasion, and as fresh violence rips across Afghanistan. Any contact between the Kabul government and the Taliban is seen as hugely significant, because the insurgents view Ghani as a US stooge and his government as a puppet regime, and have long refused to speak with them directly. They have insisted that any government officials attending this week’s talks will be doing so only in a “personal capacity”. The US, which has cited significant progress after holding direct talks with the militants in Doha several times since September, is not expected to attend. The militants have not announced a final list of who is headed to Doha, and distanced themselves from a report that suggested their delegation might also include women. The peace process thus far has been widely criticised for a lack of female representation, and US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has pushed for greater inclusivity. While the Taliban previously met with Afghan representatives and politicians in Moscow in February, those talks did not include members of Ghani’s government. The spokesman for former president Hamid Karzai, who was at the Moscow talks, said Karzai supported the “intra-Afghan” conference in Doha but would not be attending. Kabul has also been left out of the talks with the Khalilzad and the US delegation, prompting concerns the Afghan government is being sidelined in its own peace process and underscoring the importance of this week’s meetings in Doha. This month, the United Nations said it had lifted travel bans for 11 Taliban delegates so they could attend talks. That list includes Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a co-founder of the Islamist movement and its top political leader, as well as Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, the Taliban’s chief negotiator and former deputy minister of foreign affairs. The Taliban last week announced the start of Operation Fath, this year’s spring offensive, and violence has continued apace across Afghanistan despite Khalilzad calling for a ceasefire. AFP.

Fire devastates Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris,"PARIS: Notre-Dame Cathedral went up in flames on Monday in a roaring blaze that devastated the Parisian landmark, one of France’s most visited places. Flames burst through the roof of the centuries-old cathedral and quickly engulfed the spire, which collapsed. A huge plume of smoke wafted across the city and ash fell over a large area. “Everything is collapsing,” a police officer near the scene said as the entire roof of the cathedral continued to burn.  Firefighters cleared the area around the cathedral, which marks the very centre of Paris. Buildings around were evacuated. President Emmanuel Macron cancelled an address to the nation that he had been due to give later on Monday evening. A presidential official said Macron was to go to the scene of the blaze. “A terrible fire is under way at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris,” Mayor Anne Hidalgo said on Twitter.  France 2 television reported that police were treating the incident as an accident. The cathedral, which dates back to the 12th century, features in Victor Hugo’s classic novel “The Hunchback of Notre-Dame”. It attracts millions of tourists every year. Notre-Dame was in the midst of renovations, with some sections under scaffolding and bronze statues were removed last week for works. US President Donald Trump expressed horror on Monday at the fire engulfing the historic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris. “So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.

Hopeful of resuming Pak-India dialogues after elections: Sohail Mehmood,"NEW DEHLI: Pakistan’s outgoing high commissioner to India, Sohail Mahmood said on Sunday hopeful of “re-engagement” of Pakistan-India dialogues after the elections as communication and dialogues are the only way of resolving reservations between both nations. In an interview to The Times of India, the Commissioner said diplomacy and dialogues are indispensable as communication between the countries will help laying foundation of regional peace. The outgoing envoy said, “sustained engagement and structured dialogue would enable the two countries to understand mutual concerns and differences, resolve outstanding disputes and build the edifice of durable peace, security, and prosperity in the region,” while stressing the need for evaluation of existing narrative about Pakistan in India. Mehmood said, “a narrative is needed that captures the reality in Pakistan objectively and more fully. A narrative that also helps recognise opportunities for peaceful, cooperative and good neighbourly relations. We must strive for stable peace, equal security and shared prosperity for ourselves and the region.” “The government of Pakistan is proceeding in full measures to complete the physical infrastructure on its side and it is hopeful that the modalities will be mutually agreed between the two sides in good time before November 2019,” the envoy said when asked about Karatarpur Corridor. On Thursday, Pakistan sent another set of questions to the Indian High Commission on the Pulwama dossier, Foreign Office spokesperson Dr Mohammad Faisal said. Addressing the press briefing, Dr Faisal said he hopes India will answer the questions soon. Dr Faisal said the Federal Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had credible intelligence of India devising new plan to attack Pakistan between April 16 and 20. He said, “India will receive the same response as February 27 if it challenges our resolve.” On February 27, Pakistan Air Force (PAF) shot down two Indian military aircrafts after they trespassed the Line of Control (LOC) and captured an Indian pilot who was subsequently released as a sign of peace. On February 26, Pakistan befittingly responded to LOC violation by two Indian aircrafts. India presumably attacked in response to February 14 Pulwama suicide bombing which the country blamed on Pakistan without showing any proof whatsoever. The Foreign Office of Pakistan said the Indian dossier on the Pulwama attack did not contain any evidence regarding the involvement of Pakistan or Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) chief Masood Azhar. Foreign Office spokesperson Dr Mohammad Faisal, in his weekly press briefing on March 28, said a preliminary probe by Pakistan into the Pulwama suicide bombing after receiving the Indian dossier revealed no links of any Pakistani to the attack. The FO further apprised that a 10-member team of the Federal Investigation Agency started probe into the Pulwama incident, in which more than 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers were killed, soon after Pakistan received the Indian dossier. According to the preliminary probe, no Pakistani had any links to the attack, the spokesperson said. Pakistan has asked India for further details and evidences relating to the attack, he added. Dr Faisal said the Indian dossier named more than 90 people. But there was no evidence linking JeM chief Masood Azhar or Pakistan to the attack.

"Nepal plane hits parked helicopter while taking off, killing three","KATHMANDU: A small plane operated by a private airline in Nepal hit a parked helicopter on Sunday while preparing to take off in a mountainous area near Mount Everest, killing three people including a co-pilot, an airport official said.

The plane, operated by Summit Air, was not carrying passengers as it was trying to leave what is considered to be one of the world’s most dangerous airports due to the shortness of its runway and its location surrounded by mountains. Officials said the cause of the incident was not immediately known. “Two people died on the spot and the third one died while undergoing treatment in a hospital in Kathmandu,” airport official Pratap Babu Tiwari told Reuters. The dead included two security guards who were near the helicopter. The pilot of the plane was among three people injured, though the lone stewardess escaped unhurt. Air crashes are common in mostly mountainous Nepal, home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountain peaks, including Mount Everest. In February a helicopter carrying seven people including the country’s tourism minister crashed in bad weather in eastern Nepal, killing seven all on board. The Lukla airport was built by New Zealand mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary – who together with Sherpa Tenzing Norgay became the first to reach the 8,850-metre (29,035-foot) Everest peak in 1953 – as a gift to the people of the remote Solukhumbu region where it is located. In 2008, another Twin Otter plane carrying 16 passengers and three crew crashed shortly before it was due to land at Lukla. REUTERS.

Setback for Ruling Party: Congress accuses BJP government over money laundering scam,"New-Delhi: On Saturday, Indian National Congress (INC) leader Kapil Sibal alleged that the current BJP-led government was involved in a money laundering scam during the 2016 demonetisation drive, Hindustan Times reported. Sibal, speaking a press conference that was blanked out by Indian media channels, said there was a “sting operation” during which old currency notes were exchanged post-demonetisation for a commission of up to 40 per cent. He added that the act was carried out by those who claimed close proximity to the government and the BJP.  Furthermore, Sibal further alleged BJP President Amit Shah, his son Jay Shah and Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel were among those involved in the scam. The Congress leader also claimed an official of India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) was also involved. “Modi started his tenure by fooling us and he is ending his five-year tenure by traumatising us. He traumatised the people of this country, he has traumatised the poor of this country, he has traumatised journalists and his political opponents. He has used the agencies to target people who are opposed to him,” Sibal said. He further stated currency notes worth billions were printed abroad and then transported into India using special aircraft, The Hindu reported. He alleged that “a team of government officials drawn from different departments were engaged in the exchange of old notes for new post demonetisation”. The Congress leader also showed a video during the press conference which showed demonetised currency notes being exchanged for a 15 to 40 per cent commission. Sibal said: “It is another proof of how the Prime Minister Modi-led government looted the people by banning the notes of INR500 and INR1,000 denominations during demonetisation in 2016”. Another video showed a private bank official exchanging old currency notes with new ones. “The video shows the exchange of demonetised notes with the new ones in a government godown in Maharashtra,” Sibal said, saying the video was shot by an undercover journalist.

BJP president vows to throw illegal immigrants into Bay of Bengal,"NEW DELHI: The head of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Hindu nationalist party took his invective against illegal Muslim immigrants to a new level this week as the general election kicked off, promising to throw them into the Bay of Bengal. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Amit Shah referred to such illegal immigrants as “termites”, a description he also used last September, when he drew condemnation from rights groups. The US State Department also noted the remark in its annual human rights report. “Infiltrators are like termites in the soil of Bengal,” Shah said on Thursday at a rally in West Bengal, as voting in India’s 39-day general election started. “A Bharatiya Janata Party government will pick up infiltrators one by one and throw them into the Bay of Bengal,” he said, referring to illegal immigrants from neighbouring Muslim-majority Bangladesh. Shah nevertheless reiterated the BJP’s stance on giving citizenship to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs from Bangladesh and Pakistan. India is already working on deporting an estimated 40,000 Rohingya Muslims living in the country after fleeing Buddhist-majority Myanmar. New Delhi considers them a security threat. The comments from Shah, the right-hand man of Modi, drew criticism from the main opposition Congress party as well as minority groups. On Twitter, some users likened his speech to a suggestion of ethnic cleansing. “The statement is a direct attack on the identity and integrity of the nation as a secular state,” the Kerala Christian Forum, a group from the southern state, said in a statement. It demanded an apology from Shah. A BJP spokesman declined to comment on the speech. Congress spokesman Sanjay Jha said Shah’s remarks were a deliberate attempt to polarise voters along sectarian lines. “The political business model of the BJP is to raise the communal temperature, keep it at a boil, and to keep India in a permanent religious divide,” Jha said.

Joy turns to anger for Sudan protesters,"KHARTOUM: Jubilation in Khartoum that Sudan’s era of iron-fisted rule by Omar al-Bashir was ending Thursday quickly soured when protesters realised the old regime had no plans to go. “Change will not happen with Bashir’s entire regime hoodwinking Sudanese civilians through a military coup,” tweeted Alaa Salah, who has become an icon of the protest movement after a video of her leading demonstrators’ chants went viral. Excitement and jubilation began to turn to anger and defiance only hours after Defence Minister Awad Ibnouf announced that Bashir had been ousted by the army and a military council was being put in his place for two years. Thousands of people had flooded the centre of the capital Khartoum from early morning, cheering, waving flags and even kissing and hugging soldiers as they danced on armoured vehicles. But after the army’s announcement, the celebrations evaporated, and the tone hardened. “We are not leaving, we are not leaving. Just fall and that’s all,” some protesters in front of the army headquarters began chanting. Demonstrators began re-erecting make-shift checkpoints set up on several streets leading to the sprawling complex, which earlier in the day had been dismantled after an unprecedented five-night sit-in. While some people had dejectedly already left the site, after standing for hours in the searing Sudanese sun hoping to witness the dawn of a new future, others began to arrive to take their place. The army has slapped a night-time curfew on the country that started at 10PM. But as night set in, thousands of protesters defied the curfew and remained camped at the complex, showing no signs of dispersing. “I cried when Ibnouf made the announcement,” said Heba, carrying a Sudanese flag, as she prepared to spend the night at the complex. “We have lost our friends in this movement. We feel as if they died for nothing, but we will continue until victory.” Behind her, crowds were chanting their slogan “peace! justice! freedom!” as they thronged the complex for the sixth night running. ‘Two sides of one coin’
“This is a farce. The regime did not fall. This is a reproduction of the same regime,” one demonstrator told AFP, gesturing emphatically. “This man (Bashir) is a bloodthirsty leader and he is wanted, he brings us another regime. This is completely unacceptable,” added another. As activists began telling protesters not to leave the site despite the curfew, one woman in a bright red headscarf also dismissed Thursday’s events. “Ibnouf and Bashir are two sides of the same coin,” she told AFP. “As youth and citizens we see what’s happening, the government is manipulating us.” Many people were still waving the Sudanese flag, in similar scenes seen in Algeria recently where long-time president Abdelaziz Bouteflika bowed to weeks of popular protests and resigned on April 2. Gone however were the joyful songs from earlier in the day. Abdel Wahid Nour, head of the rebel Sudan Liberation Army-Abdel Wahid (SLA-AW) group fighting government forces in Darfur, denounced what he called a “palace coup”. “What has been issued in the statement is recycling of the regime with new faces,” he said in a statement.

Tsunami alert: Earthquake of magnitude 7 strikes south of Indonesia,"JAKARTA: Indonesia’s geophysics agency said a tsunami is possible after a strong earthquake struck Friday east of Sulawesi island. The US Geological Survey said the quake, which was centered at a depth of 17 kilometers (10.5 miles), had a magnitude of 6.8.  The epicenter of the quake is far from the central Sulawesi city of Palu, which was devastated by an earthquake and tsunami in September, but it was felt there and caused people to run into the streets in panic. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions due to its location on the seismically active Pacific “Ring of Fire.” More than 4,400 people were killed in the Palu disaster. AP.

Julian Assange arrested by UK police and removed from Ecuador embassy,"Wiki Leaks founder Julian Assange has been arrested by British police at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Officers executed a warrant for the 47-year-old’s arrest on Thursday morning after the Ecuadorian government withdrew his asylum. Mr Assange took refuge in the Knightsbridge embassy seven years ago to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faced sexual assault allegations.  Those accusations have since been dropped but he remained wanted for failing to surrender to Westminster Magistrates’ Court in June 2012. Mr Assange has maintained his arrest would lead him being extradited to the US, where he faces charges over the release of sensitive government files. The Metropolitan Police said it “had a duty to execute the warrant” and was ”invited into the embassy by the Ambassador, following the Ecuadorian government’s withdrawal of asylum”. He blamed Mr Assange’s “discourteous and aggressive behaviour” for his expulsion from the embassy. Wikileaks claimed Ecuador had had terminated the asylum “in violation of international law”.  “Powerful actors, including CIA, are engaged in a sophisticated effort to dehumanise, delegitimise and imprison” Mr Assange, it added in a tweet. The Wikileaks founder was led “screaming” and “struggling” from the embassy at about 10.25am, according to a witness. Footage showed him surrounded by officers as he was led from the building and bundled into a waiting van. Mr Assange was taken into custody at central London police station and will appear before Westminster magistrates “as soon as is possible”, Scotland Yard said. Sajid Javid, the UK home secretary, said the Wikileaks founder was “rightly facing justice in the UK”. He added: “I would like to thank Ecuador for its cooperation and the Met Police for its professionalism. No one is above the law.” A United Nations human rights expert last week expressed concern about reports that Mr Assange was set to be expelled from the embassy. “He is likely to be arrested by British authorities and extradited to the United States,” said Nils Merlzer, the UN special rapporteur on torture. “Such a response could expose him to a real risk of serious violations of his human rights, including his freedom of expression, his right to a fair trial and the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” ",https://www.newsone.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Julian-assange.jpg,World,No one is above the law.” A United Nations human rights expert last week expressed concern about reports that Mr Assange was set to be expelled from the embassy.,neutral
Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir resigns after massive protest,"KHARTOUM: Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has stepped down and consultations are under way to form a transitional council to run the country, government sources and a provincial minister said on Thursday. The minister of production and economic resources in North Darfur, Adel Mahjoub Hussein, told the Dubai-based al-Hadath TV that “there are consultations to form a military council to take over power after President Bashir stepped down”. Sudanese sources confirmed the report and told Reuters Bashir was at the presidential residence under “heavy guard”. The military will make an announcement soon, state television said as troops were deployed in Khartoum. “The armed forces will present an important statement shortly. Be ready for it,” the announcement on state television read, without giving further details. The army and security services deployed troops around the defence ministry and on major roads and bridges in the capital as thousands of people flocked to an anti-government protest outside the ministry, a Reuters witness said. Tens of thousands of Sudanese took to the streets in the centre of Khartoum in jubilation, dancing and chanting anti-Bashir slogans. Protesters outside the defence ministry chanted: “It has fallen, we won.” State television and radio played patriotic music, reminding older Sudanese of how military takeovers unfolded during previous episodes of civil unrest. Divisive figure
Bashir, a former paratrooper who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1989, has been a divisive figure who has managed his way through one internal crisis after another while withstanding attempts by the West to weaken him. Sudan has suffered prolonged periods of isolation since 1993, when the United States added Bashir’s government to its list of terrorism sponsors for harbouring Islamist militants. Washington followed up with sanctions four years later. Bashir has also been indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague over allegations of genocide in Sudan’s Darfur region during an insurgency that began in 2003. The latest crisis has escalated since the weekend, when thousands of demonstrators began camping out outside the Defence Ministry compound in central Khartoum, where Bashir’s residence is located. Clashes erupted on Tuesday between soldiers trying to protect the protesters and intelligence and security personnel trying to disperse them. At least 11 people died in the clashes, including six members of the armed forces, the information minister said, citing a police report. Since Dec. 19, Sudan has been rocked by persistent protests sparked by the government’s attempt to raise the price of bread, and an economic crisis that has led to fuel and cash shortages Opposition figures have called for the military to help negotiate an end to Bashir’s nearly three decades in power and a transition to democracy. The demonstrators at the Defence Ministry had said that they wanted to submit a petition for the armed forces to take their side in their attempt to remove Bashir and his Islamist-backed administration.

Shutdown observed in Kashmir against Indian elections,"SRINAGAR: A complete shutdown is being observed in Indian occupied Kashmir on Thursday against the first phase of Indian election as well as brutal measures against the Kashmiri people and their leadership. The call for strike was given by the Joint Resistance Leadership comprising Syed Ali Gillani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Yasin Malik. The JRL in a statement said, “The strike is aimed to protest against the “National Investigation Agency (NIA) aggression which includes the shifting of JKLF Chairman Muhammad Yasin Malik to Delhi’s Tihar jail under the pretext of questioning by the National Investigation Agency, rigorous questioning of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq at NIA headquarters in Delhi and sustained interrogation and repeated summoning of two sons of APHC Chairman Syed Ali Gilani to Delhi by NIA.” The shutdown is also being observed against the closure of Kashmir’s main highway for civilians and the recent attack by Indian police and forces on inmates in Srinagar Central Jail. Indians began voting on Thursday in the first phase of a mammoth general election, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi gunning for a second term. Voting in the first of seven rounds is being held in 91 parliament constituencies across 20 states and federally administered regions. There are 543 seats at stake. The main opposition Congress party, which wrested three major farming states from the BJP in December by promising to waive the outstanding loans of distressed farmers, has looked for allies among regional parties to defeat the BJP over its record on the economy.

India’s giant election gets underway with voting in first of seven phases,"GHAZIABAD: Indians began voting on Thursday in the first phase of a mammoth general election, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi gunning for a second term having campaigned strongly on his national security record following a flare up in tensions with Pakistan. Security for the polls was increased after seven people were killed in attacks in occupied Kashmir, the country’s only Muslim majority state, and in eastern India, where Maoist insurgents were blamed for a bomb that killed a state legislator from Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Voting in the first of seven rounds is being held in 91 parliament constituencies across 20 states and federally administered regions. There are 543 seats at stake. Modi’s BJP has entered the election as the frontrunner, despite economic distress over mounting unemployment, and weak farm incomes in rural areas, where two-thirds of Indians live. In a posting on Twitter as voting began, Modi urged people to turn out in large numbers and said the mood nationwide was running in favour of his alliance. Pollsters say support for the BJP rose in response to Modi’s tough stance against Pakistan, which saw aerial clashes between the nuclear-armed neighbours following an attack in February that killed 40 paramilitary police in occupied Kashmir. The main opposition Congress party, which wrested three major farming states from the BJP in December by promising to waive the outstanding loans of distressed farmers, has looked for allies among regional parties to defeat the BJP over its record on the economy. But the upsurge in nationalist fervour has undermined the opposition strategy. “I support the prime minister’s policies, especially his foreign policy,” Sachin Tyagi, 38, a mobile phone shop owner, told Reuters near a polling station in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. “He’s improved India’s global standing, and taken revenge against the enemies of the country. I am happy with Modi-ji but the employment situation could be improved.” About two dozen voters had lined up at that voting centre and more were streaming in early on Thursday. Young men in jeans and shorts, older men in white kurtas and women in colourful sarees stood in the lines. Spread over 39 days, the final phase of the election will be held on May 19, and the result will be announced on May 23. Gilles Verniers, a political science professor at Ashoka University near New Delhi, predicted Congress, led by Rahul Gandhi, would struggle to catch the BJP. “The gap between Congress and the BJP is still enormous, so no one is seriously thinking that Congress is going to fill that gap,” he added. “The opposition landscape remains heavily fragmented.” An average of four opinion polls showed the BJP-alliance on course to win 273 of the 545 seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament, a much-reduced majority from the more than 330-seat majority it scored at the last election. In the 2014 general election, the BJP alone won a landslide 282 seats, securing a clear single-party majority for the first time in decades and raising hopes of economic reform after a period of sluggish growth. In Uttar Pradesh, which sends more lawmakers to parliament than any other, Ajesh Kumar, who runs a roadside restaurant, said he voted for the BJP in 2014, when Hindu-Muslims riots in the area killed at least 65 people, and would do so again. “But jobs are a problem here,” he said, echoing government and private statistics here that show Modi’s government has failed to create enough work for the millions of young Indians entering the labour force each year. Almost 900 million of India’s 1.3 billion people are eligible to vote. The first phase of voting covers an electorate of 142 million. From sugar farmers in northern India going unpaid for produce, to small businesses in the south shut because they are unable to meet the requirements of a new, unifying national tax, discontent over the economy has brewed for months. A Reuters analysis of 50 pledges from the BJP’s 2014 manifesto showed Modi only partly fulfilled, or did not fulfil, most promises on the economy and business. Having won only 44 seats last time, Congress is trying to rebuild its appeal, and has promised monthly handouts of 6,000 rupees ($86.59) for the poorest families. It hopes to win enough seats to lure regional parties opposed to Modi to back it after the election and form the government. Reuters.

New Zealand votes to amend gun laws after Christchurch attack with overwhelming majority,"Lawmakers in New Zealand voted almost unanimously on Wednesday to change gun laws, less than a month after its worst peacetime mass shooting, in which 50 people were killed in attacks on two mosques in Christchurch. Parliament passed the gun reform bill, the first substantial changes to New Zealand’s gun laws in decades, by 119 to 1. It must now receive royal assent from the governor general to become law. “There have been very few occasions when I have seen parliament come together in this way, and I can’t imagine circumstances when it is more necessary,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in presenting the legislation. Ardern banned the sale of all military-style semi-automatics (MSSA) and assault rifles just six days after the March 15 shooting, and announced plans to tighten gun laws. A lone gunman used semi-automatic guns in the Christchurch mosque attacks, killing 50 people as they attended Friday prayers. Authorities have charged Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a suspected white supremacist, with 50 counts of murder following the attacks. The new curbs bar the circulation and use of most semi-automatic firearms, parts that convert firearms into semi-automatic firearms, magazines over a certain capacity, and some shotguns. Existing gun laws had provided for a standard A-category gun license covering semi-automatics limited to seven shots. The bill grants an amnesty until Sept 30 for people to surrender prohibited items. More than 300 weapons had already been handed in, police minister Stuart Nash told parliament. The government has begun work on a second arms amendment bill it hopes to introduce in June, he said, adding that the measure would tackle issues regarding a gun registry, among others. The government has faced criticism from some quarters for rushing through the bill. Wednesday’s dissenting vote came from David Seymour, leader of the small free-market ACT Party, who questioned why the measure was being rushed through. Ardern said majority lawmakers believe such guns had no place in New Zealand. “We are ultimately here because 50 people died and they do not have a voice,” she added. “We, in this house, are their voice and today we have used that voice wisely.” Since last month’s shooting, New Zealand has tightened security and cancelled several events in Auckland, its largest city, intended to commemorate ANZAC Day on April 25. “There is no information about a specific threat to ANZAC events,” police official Karyn Malthus, said in a statement. “However its important that the public be safe, and feel safe, at events in the current environment.” In 1996, neighbouring Australia banned semi-automatic weapons and launched a gun buyback after the Port Arthur massacre that killed 35 people.

Benjamin Netanyahu elected for the fifth time as Israeli PM,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has won the Israeli national election, securing a record fifth term in office despite running neck-and-neck with his challenger Benny Gantz, the country’s three main television channels said on Wednesday. With 97 per cent of the votes counted, neither of the candidates’ parties had captured a ruling majority, but Netanyahu was clearly in a strong position to form a coalition government with other right-wing factions that have backed him. The closely contested race was widely seen in Israel as a referendum on Netanyahu’s character and record in the face of corruption allegations. He faces possible indictment in three graft cases, and has denied wrongdoing in all of them. The veteran right-wing leader’s Likud party and Gantz’s new centrist Blue and White party both won 35 seats, according to the Knesset website and the Israeli TV channels. That would mean a five-seat gain for Likud. “It is a night of colossal victory,” the 69-year-old Netanyahu told cheering supporters in a late-night speech at Likud headquarters, while cautioning that a “long night and possibly day” lay ahead awaiting official results. Fireworks flared behind him as his wife Sara applauded and kissed him. “He’s a magician,” the crowd chanted. Final results were expected by Friday, though the provisional results showed 65 of the Knesset’s 120 seats would go to the right-wing bloc of parties led by Netanyahu, against a total of 55 seats for centre-left factions. If he wins, Netanyahu, 69, will be on track to be the longest-serving prime minister in Israel’s 71-year history. Netanyahu said he had already begun talks with prospective coalition allies. In power since 2009, and having led the country for a total 13 years including his first term in the 1990s, Netanyahu has been fighting for his political survival. He faces possible indictment in three graft cases. He has denied any wrongdoing. Rival Gantz, a popular 59-year-old former general, had also claimed victory earlier, citing preliminary exit polls published soon after voting ended on Tuesday that showed his party had won more seats than Likud. “We are the victors,” said Gantz, a former military chief fighting his first election. “We want to thank Benjamin Netanyahu for his service to the nation.” Despite both men claiming victory on Tuesday night, a clearer picture emerged by Wednesday morning as the results began streaming in, painting Netanyahu as the winner. During the campaign, the rival parties accused each other of corruption, fostering bigotry and being soft on security. Explore: Do Trump and Netanyahu have a mutually beneficial relationship? Netanyahu highlighted his close relationship with US President Donald Trump, who delighted Israelis and angered Palestinians by recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017 and moving the American Embassy to the holy city last May. Two weeks before the election, Trump signed a proclamation, with Netanyahu at his side at the White House, recognising Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. In a rare turn during the race towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Netanyahu further alarmed Palestinians by pledged to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if re-elected. Palestinians seek a state there and in the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Read: Palestine, Turkey denounce Netanyahu’s campaign pledge to change West Bank status Netanyahu’s pre-election promise was widely seen as an attempt to draw right-wing votes rather than a change of policy. But with Trumps moves on Jerusalem and The Golan, the prime minister may feel emboldened to advocate for annexation. Commenting on the election, Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said: “Israelis have voted to preserve the status quo. They have said no to peace and yes to the occupation”. The last round of US-brokered peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014. Trump is expected to release his administration’s long-awaited Middle East peace plan after the election. If it includes Israeli concessions to the Palestinians, Netanyahus probable far-right coalition allies will likely object. A close result in the election would put smaller parties in a powerful position, turning marginal political figures into kingmakers. Once the votes are tallied, President Reuven Rivlin will ask parties that have won parliamentary seats who they support for prime minister. He will then pick a party leader to try to form a coalition, giving the candidate 28 days to do so, with a two-week extension if needed.

"PCB now being taken seriously at international level, says Mani","LAHORE: Recent completion of eight HBL PSL season 4 matches in Karachi are an indication that, “Pakistan Cricket Board’s credibility has hit a new level,” PCB Chief Ehsan Mani said on Monday, adding that the Board is now being, “taken seriously” on the international rank. PCB Chief was speaking to a press conference in Lahore very next day to the PSL final in which Quetta Gladiators defeated Peshawar Zalmi at the National Stadium Karachi. PCB Chief said that biggest “endorsement” came from the arrival of 39 to 40 foreign players in Pakistan. “Add support staff to it and the number reaches 150 people. Our credibility — and International Cricket Council (ICC) CEO David Richardson also [corroborated] this — in the international world has reached a new level. Now when we say something, we are taken seriously and believed,” he said. “The most impressive bit was how the Karachi crowd supported us. Some 200,000 came to watch these matches, and from what I believe, 150 million saw the matches on TV,” said Mani, adding that it was a incredible endorsement for PSL. “Due to the geo-political situation, it was important that we demonstrated that Pakistan is capable of holding such an event,” he said. PCB Chief said it was initially suggested to him to hold only five matches in Karachi but he instead vowed to hold more matches in Pakistan. “And the credit goes to the local administration for mobilizing their resources on just a few days’ notice. Everyone supported us and no one said that this would be too much as this was a matter of national pride,” he said. Sharing his thoughts on the New Zealand incident, Mani said the incident signifies that terrorism is not only problem of Pakistan but is a global hazard. “People forget that we are also the victims of terrorism. Now the world knows what challenges are there. Pakistan’s problems are not different to anyone else’s,” he said. “It doesn’t mean we should gloat. We will work with them and share our experiences but cricket should not stop. If cricket stops due to terrorism then it’s a victory for the terrorists. Players’ safety is of course important and cannot be risked but the game must go on too,” Mani said. PCB Chief said he invited some foreign security experts in Pakistan so they can witness the security arrangements of PSL themselves. “In the midst of all this the New Zealand incident happened which gave the security experts an incentive to observe how we deal with terrorism in Pakistan while being a victim ourselves.” On the closing ceremony, PCB Chief said it was “toned down” in order to respect the incident.”We observed a minute’s silence, released pigeons and cut out dancing. All the songs too were iconic Pakistani songs,” said Mani. PCB Chief praised Islamabad United for their display of sportsman spirit by saying, “”In this sport, the spirit of cricket is of prime importance.

PCB Chief was speaking to a press conference in Lahore very next day to the PSL final in which Quetta Gladiators defeated Peshawar Zalmi at the National Stadium Karachi. PCB Chief said that biggest “endorsement” came from the arrival of 39 to 40 foreign players in Pakistan. “Add support staff to it and the number reaches 150 people. Our credibility — and International Cricket Council (ICC) CEO David Richardson also [corroborated] this — in the international world has reached a new level. Now when we say something, we are taken seriously and believed,” he said. “The most impressive bit was how the Karachi crowd supported us. Some 200,000 came to watch these matches, and from what I believe, 150 million saw the matches on TV,” said Mani, adding that it was a incredible endorsement for PSL. “Due to the geo-political situation, it was important that we demonstrated that Pakistan is capable of holding such an event,” he said. PCB Chief said it was initially suggested to him to hold only five matches in Karachi but he instead vowed to hold more matches in Pakistan. “And the credit goes to the local administration for mobilizing their resources on just a few days’ notice. Everyone supported us and no one said that this would be too much as this was a matter of national pride,” he said. Sharing his thoughts on the New Zealand incident, Mani said the incident signifies that terrorism is not only problem of Pakistan but is a global hazard. “People forget that we are also the victims of terrorism. Now the world knows what challenges are there. Pakistan’s problems are not different to anyone else’s,” he said. “It doesn’t mean we should gloat. We will work with them and share our experiences but cricket should not stop. If cricket stops due to terrorism then it’s a victory for the terrorists. Players’ safety is of course important and cannot be risked but the game must go on too,” Mani said. PCB Chief said he invited some foreign security experts in Pakistan so they can witness the security arrangements of PSL themselves. “In the midst of all this the New Zealand incident happened which gave the security experts an incentive to observe how we deal with terrorism in Pakistan while being a victim ourselves.” On the closing ceremony, PCB Chief said it was “toned down” in order to respect the incident.”We observed a minute’s silence, released pigeons and cut out dancing. All the songs too were iconic Pakistani songs,” said Mani. PCB Chief praised Islamabad United for their display of sportsman spirit by saying, “”In this sport, the spirit of cricket is of prime importance. One demonstration of this was done by Islamabad United. The Spirit of Cricket trophy they received, they dedicated it to Asif Ali, whose daughter is battling cancer.” ",https://www.newsone.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Ehsan-mani.jpg,PSL 2019,"“In the midst of all this the New Zealand incident happened which gave the security experts an incentive to observe how we deal with terrorism in Pakistan while being a victim ourselves.” On the closing ceremony, PCB Chief said it was “toned down” in order to respect the incident.”We observed a minute’s silence, released pigeons and cut out dancing.",negative

Black armbands sported by PSL players to denounce NZ Christchurch killings,"KARACHI: HBL PSL players and match officials sported black armbands during the eliminator 2 match at the National Stadium Karachi on Friday to denounce New Zealand Christchurch killings that traumatized the world. A minute of silence was also observed before the start of the match between Islamabad United and Peshawar Zalmi to articulate cohesion with the victims of one of the most dreadful terror attacks in history. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) earlier conveyed distress and sorrow over the Christchurch attacks prior to the Friday prayers. PCB Chief Ehsan Mani said, “On behalf of the Pakistan cricket fraternity, I would like to condemn in the strongest possible way the cowardly, uncivilized and inhuman terrorist attacks on the innocent worshippers in Christchurch mosques.” “Our hearts go out for all those affected by this tragedy as who will feel and understand their pain and loss better than us,” PCB Chief said. “In these difficult times, we also stand firmly with our colleagues in New Zealand Cricket and offer our deepest condolences. We are also aware that the Bangladesh men’s cricket team were also praying at a mosque near the Hagley Park. We thank Allah Almighty that all of them escaped unhurt,” Mani further said. “As a mark of respect for the victims and to show support and solidarity with the New Zealand community and the NZC, it has been decided that we will observe a minute’s silence before the start of tonight’s Pakistan Super League match, while all the players and match officials will wear black armbands,” said Mani. Forty people were killed and 20 more were seriously injured in armed assaults on two Christchurch mosques Friday. “It is clear that this can now only be described as a terrorist attack,” she said. “From what we know, it does appear to have been well planned.” “Two explosive devices attached to suspect vehicles have now been found and they have been disarmed,” said New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. New Zealand police said they have detained three people and had secured a number of improvised explosive devices. He said the suspected IEDs found attached to the attackers´ vehicles had been made safe by the military. Video footage widely circulated on social media, apparently taken by a gunman and posted online live as the attack unfolded, showed him driving to one mosque, entering it and shooting randomly at people inside. Worshippers, possibly dead or wounded, lay huddled on the floor of the mosque, the video showed. Witnesses told media that a man dressed in a military-style, camouflage outfit, and carrying an automatic rifle had started randomly shooting people in the Al Noor mosque. The Bangladesh cricket team was arriving for prayers when the shooting occurred but all members were safe, a team coach told Reuters. Prime Minister Imran Khan blamed the increasing terror attacks on Islamophobia post 9/11. “Shocked and strongly condemn the Christchurch, New Zealand, terrorist attack on mosques. This reaffirms what we have always maintained: that terrorism does not have a religion. Prayers go to the victims and their families,” he tweeted. “I blame these increasing terror attacks on the current Islamophobia post-9/11 where Islam and 1.3 billion Muslims have collectively been blamed for any act of terror by a Muslim. This has been done deliberately to also demonize legitimate Muslim political struggles,” PM Imran added ",https://www.newsone.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/PSL-CHRISTCHURCH2.jpg,PSL 2019,A minute of silence was also observed before the start of the match between Islamabad United and Peshawar Zalmi to articulate cohesion with the victims of one of the most dreadful terror attacks in history.,negative

Liverpool back on top as Salah stunner kills off Chelsea,"LIVERPOOL: Liverpool powered back to the top of the Premier League after Mohamed Salah´s stunning strike clinched a 2-0 win over Chelsea on Sunday. Jurgen Klopp´s side had surrendered pole position a few hours earlier when Manchester City won 3-1 at Crystal Palace, piling pressure on the Reds to respond as the title race heats up. Liverpool rose to the challenge as Sadio Mane´s opener five minutes after the break and a blistering long-range drive from Salah two minutes later moved them two points clear of second-placed City on a raucous afternoon at Anfield. City have five games left compared to just four for Liverpool, leaving the destiny of the title in the hands of the champions. But there is a growing feeling at Anfield that this will be the season Liverpool finally end their 29-year wait to be crowned kings of English football. Chelsea posed the last major threat to Liverpool´s title bid, yet the leaders dealt with the challenge impressively to mark Klopp´s 200th game as Reds manager in style. With City having difficult league fixtures looming against Tottenham and Manchester United, Klopp´s men are convinced they can hold onto pole position. Their run-in is undoubtedly less daunting than City´s, with Cardiff, Huddersfield and Newcastle on the schedule before a potential title party against Wolves at Anfield. For fourth-placed Chelsea, the loss was a blow to their bid for Champions League football next season and they will drop to fifth if Arsenal win at Watford on Monday. On the eve of the 30th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster that killed 96 Liverpool fans and in the week that club legend Tommy Smith passed away, there was even more emotion at Anfield than usual. After a minute´s silence featuring mosaics reading “30 years” and “96” held up by fans around the ground, Liverpool´s focus was trained on avenging one of the more painful defeats in the club´s recent history. Steven Gerrard´s infamous slip in 2014 led to a defeat against Chelsea that effectively gifted the title to Manchester City when Liverpool had looked odds-on to lift the trophy. But Klopp insisted his players wouldn´t be haunted by the ghosts of that collapse and they were true to his word. Liverpool threatened an early goal when Mane whipped a pin-point cross towards Salah and he fired a volley that Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga held well. Chelsea were unbeaten in their last eight matches at Anfield going into Sunday´s clash and showed signs of troubling Liverpool when Eden Hazard twisted away from Joel Matip for a low shot that forced Alisson Becker into action. David Luiz launched a dangerous Chelsea counter-attack with a pass that sent Willian racing away, but the Brazilian´s miscued shot drifted wide. Those escapes shook Liverpool out of their brief lull and Salah got behind Emerson to cross for Mane to smash just wide. Hampered by a first-half injury to Antonio Rudiger, Chelsea creaked at the back and Liverpool took full advantage to break the deadlock in the 51st minute. When Salah scampered onto Roberto Firmino´s flick in the Chelsea area, Blues defender Emerson could only prod the ball to the influential Jordan Henderson and his deft cross reached the unmarked Mane, who headed home at the far post. Any Liverpool nerves had been wiped away by jubilant celebrations and soon after Salah blew the roof off Anfield with a moment of pure genius. Taking possession wide on the right flank, Salah cut inside and glided away from Emerson before unleashing a sumptuous 25-yard drive that arrowed past Kepa into the far corner. It was a sweet moment of vindication for the Egypt forward after a group of Chelsea fans were filmed chanting “Salah is a bomber” before their team´s Europa League tie at Slavia Prague on Thursday. And Salah, a practising Muslim, celebrated his 22nd goal of the season by adopting a prayer position in front of the Kop. Hazard should have reduced the deficit, but twice the Belgian couldn´t find the net from close-range as Liverpool moved a step closer to their holy grail. AFP.

Tiger Woods wins Masters to claim first major in 11 years,"AUGUSTA: Tiger Woods completed one of thesport’s great all-time comebacks to end an 11-year major title drought at the Masters on Sunday by claiming a fifth Green Jacket. A gritty two-under 70 clinched a one-shot victory over Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka and Xander Schauffele and earned the 43-year-old a 15th major title that many thought would never come. Unsurprisingly, the triumph also renewed talks of Woods making a run at Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18 majors. Not since the 2008 US Open had Woods hoisted a major trophy and the last of his four Augusta titles came in 2005. But after a beaming Woods slipped on his fifth Green Jacket, he will be aware that Sunday’s win has brought him tantalizingly close to another Nicklaus record – that of six Augusta titles. The victory also marked the first time Woods had reached the winner’s circle at major without leading after 54 holes. Woods’s girlfriend Erica Herman, mother Kultida and two children Sam and Charlie watched while a massive gallery roared as he marched up to the 18th green to put the finishing touches on a milestone victory. When his final putt disappeared into the cup, Woods delivered one of his trademark fist pumps then raised both arms in the air screaming in absolute delight as the crowd chanted, “Tiger, Tiger, Tiger”. He then quickly spotted his family and raced over to hug his children before making his way to the scorers’ room while being congratulated by his fellow golfers who lined the way. “I was just trying to plod my way along the golf course all day,” said Woods. “When I tapped the putt in, I don’t know what I did but I know I screamed. “To have my kids there – it’s come full circle. My dad was here in 97 (when he won his first Masters) and now I’m the dad with two kids there.” Written off as too old and too beaten up from four back surgeries and multiple knee operations, Woods underwent a back fusion in 2017 and slowly returned to form.  He ended last season by winning the Tour Championship and showed signs of a breakthrough at the majors by being a title contender at last year’s British Open, where he led in the final round, and PGA Championship, where he finished runner-up. All those moments built to Sunday, when Woods was once again his old familiar dominating self. All eyes were on overnight leader Francesco Molinari, who led by two shots, Woods and the weather when play began as the race for the Green Jacket turned into a final sprint with the forecast predicting rain and thunderstorms. In a desperate attempt to get the season’s first major across the finish line before the storm hit, officials pushed up start times and sent golfers off in threesomes from both the first and 10th tees. Paired together in the final round of last year’s British Open, won by the Italian at Carnoustie, Molinari and Woods found themselves in the last group again battling for a major title. At Carnoustie, it was Woods who stumbled on the back nine while leading. But on Sunday it was Molinari who slipped up, with the 36-year-old from Turin finding the water at the 12th and 15th. The two double bogeys ended his Green Jacket bid. Molinari had played near flawless golf through the first three rounds, carding a single bogey, but on Sunday a bogey along with the two doubles during a miserable final round of two-over 74 left him two back of the winner.

Federer sweeps past Isner in Miami final for 101st title,"MIAMI: Roger Federer lifted the 101st title of his remarkable career on Sunday in dominating style, beating ATP Miami Open defending champion John Isner 6-1, 6-4. Federer, who has skipped the whole clay court season for the past two years, declared the triumph over the big-serving American in just 63 minutes was an ideal performance from which to launch a French Open bid. “I will have to take baby steps going back onto the clay, I have played so little in the last few years so I don´t know what to expect but what this win does is takes even more pressure off me,” Federer said. “Already just how I´ve been playing and moving here makes me believe just going on vacation now, a bit of a break, and then preparation, you physically I should be fine, but again, we´ll see how the body is going to react. “I am excited. It´s a good challenge,” added Federer of trying to dethrone Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros when the second Grand Slam of the season begins on May 26. Federer has been in brilliant form in South Florida, recovering superbly from losing the final in Indian Wells earlier this month to emphatically beat Isner, who was badly struggling with a foot problem at the end of the title match at Hard Rock Stadium. Federer will not appear at the next Masters event in Monte Carlo but is slated to play in Madrid at the beginning of May. “Madrid will be ´let´s see what happens´ and then obviously I want to be ready for Paris and I hope all that hard work is going to pay off for the grass and hard court season,” he said. Against Isner, Federer seized control immediately as a break in the very first game sapped Isner´s confidence and allowed Federer to aggressively gain control of a match which he never looked like losing, especially after the American´s foot problem worsened. Isner was struggling badly and was heard telling the trainer during a medical timeout that he feared he had broken his foot. “Somewhere during the first set I started feeling pain on top of my foot and it didn´t go away and it just got worse,” Isner said. Isner´s spirit was crushed after he dropped the first set in only 23 minutes. “It´s a terrible feeling, because you´re on an island out there. You have no teammates to hide behind and going up against the greatest player ever, you know, playing in this incredible atmosphere, and my foot´s killing me. “I have never had a broken foot, but that´s what I would imagine it would feel like. “Not that I would have won the match but I could have made for a more interesting match and one that was a little more fun.” This was Federer´s 154th tour final and his 50th ATP Masters showpiece appearance. He´s in the twilight of his stellar career but has no plans to hang up his racket just yet. “In terms of goals, it´s about trying to win titles and trying to manage life so I stay injury-free,” the former world number one said. “Some days you just don´t feel so well but this is a good phase, a good stretch for me right now. I really feel super healthy. That´s why I have been able to play every day for the last four weeks. That´s something that maybe hasn´t always been the case for the last few years. “So you appreciate these moments.” Isner´s booming serve failed to fire and there was to be no repeat of their last meeting at the Paris Masters 2015 when Federer was defeated in a third round encounter. To give the Swiss eight break chances in the first set spoke volumes about the sudden ineffectiveness of the Isner service game – he took only 50% of points on his first serve during the opener. With Isner hurting, Federer, who finished with a perfect 100% of points won on his first serve, wasted no time in the second set wrapping up his 28th Masters title. AFP.

The Shoaib Malik-led XI showed some improvements with the ball, however, it was their batting that let them down on Wednesday as they suffered a series defeat. On the bowling front, Mohammad Amir’s form has come under heavy scrutiny and he found himself out of the team for the second and third ODI. He will be hoping for a recall in the fourth ODI to solidify his place in the squad ahead of the World Cup in England and Wales. On the other hand, Australia who made it six consecutive ODI wins will be banking on their bowlers to continue with their winning momentum. Australian captain Aaron Finch fell just short in his bid to make a hat-trick of hundreds but his knock of 90 set his side’s victory as Australia made 266/6 before Pakistan were bowled out for just 186. Star of the third ODI, Pat Cummins who tore through the Pakistani batting order after being rested for the first two games, will be rested again for the remaining two games. Cummins will reportedly be sent home from Australia’s ODI tour of the UAE early.

Tax Amnesty scheme once again deferred as few ministers not satisfied,"ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet on Tuesday deferred the approval of the much-awaited tax amnesty scheme after some of the ministers opposed it, expressed their reservations and sought further clarification. To deliberate on the issue in detail, Prime Minister Imran Khan convened a special meeting of the cabinet on Wednesday. Federal Minister for Communications Murad Saeed said he wanted to know the difference between the proposed scheme and the similar ones which had been launched by the previous government, according to the sources privy to the details of the cabinet meeting held at PM Office. Expressing his reservation over the 15pc rate, Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda called for its reduction to facilitate taxpayers, the sources said. They said Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry was of the opinion that there was a need for reforms in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the Pakistan Customs department before launching an amnesty scheme. According to the sources, Defence Minister Pervez Khattak also opposed the idea, saying the scheme would give no benefit to the government as well as to the people because all such previous schemes had remained useless.

AI-assisted stock trading venue plans to use tech for bigger trades,"NEW YORK: Imperative Execution, a startup electronic stock trading venue operator, has found early success using artificial intelligence (AI) to reduce price movements after trades, and now it plans to use the technology to help brokers get larger trades done. Imperative Execution runs IntelligentCross, a trading platform known as an alternative trading system (ATS) that was launched in September and in the six months since has matched more than 1 billion shares. To be sure, the company faces tough competition against 31 other ATSs and 13 stock exchanges like Nasdaq Inc and Intercontinental Exchange Inc’s New York Stock Exchange, which together have matched around 6.5 billion shares each day this month. What sets IntelligentCross apart is that AI is a key feature of the ATS. Founder and Chief Executive Roman Ginis said his firm uses AI to measure the outcomes of trades in real time and then adjusts trading schedules to help brokers get better executions and save their clients money. “We want to build venues that solve for particular trading outcomes,” Ginis, a former trader at Cubist Systematic Strategies, the computer-driven trading arm of Steven Cohen’s hedge fund Point72, said in an interview. The ATS currently uses an AI-assisted order type that randomly matches undisplayed orders at the midpoint of the market’s best bid and offer every few milliseconds, rather than when the orders arrive. It then measures how much specific stock prices move and shifts the intervals between matching times to minimize price movements after the following trades. The company says this can reduce the costs between the arrival price of an order and the execution price for completing a trade by more than one basis point, which for the entire US stock market would add up to around $10 billion per year. Jack Miller, head of trading at brokerage Baird, said his firm has had success finding buyers and sellers on IntelligentCross with a very low level of market impact. “Innovations like this are important to us in driving best execution for our clients,” he said. In May, IntelligentCross is launching a new order type called the Adverse Selection Protection Engine, or ASPEN. Adverse selection refers to trading against market participants who have more information than you, potentially leaving you on the wrong side of the trade, making larger trade sizes risky. Aspen’s AI will queue up displayed orders and match them 150 microseconds to 300 microseconds apart, depending on the order size. Not matching them immediately gives brokers time to adjust their order sizes or cancel them, depending on what the market is doing in the interim. “It is designed to allow you the time to make a decision – not a ton of time, but enough with modern technology – then you don’t need to react to every single flutter of quotes on the Street,” said Ginis. If a broker posting a quote is not afraid of getting picked off, it will post larger quote sizes for others to trade against, he said. REUTERS.

Pakistan reaches ‘agreement in principle’ with IMF over bailout,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has reached an “agreement in principle” with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over a bailout program and expects to formally secure a rescue package later this month, a Pakistani minister said on Monday. The long-delayed rescue package would be Pakistan’s 13th IMF bailout program since the late 1980s and comes at a time of worsening economic outlook for the South Asian nation of 208 million people. Earlier this month, Finance Minister Asad Umar visited Washington for meetings with the IMF, which on Monday called the talks “constructive discussions”. Muhammad Azhar, state minister for revenue, tweeted that an “agreement in principle has been reached on all outstanding issues with IMF” during Umar’s trip. “Technical details and formalities will now be finalised during the IMF’s staff level visit to Pakistan later this month,” Azhar added. The IMF said on Monday its mission team will be visiting Islamabad before the end of April. Pakistan’s central bank last month lowered growth forecasts and raised interest rates at a time when inflation is at a five-year high. The rupee currency has also lost about 35 percent since December 2017. The bailout has been delayed since last year as Pakistani officials have said they worry conditions attached to the proposed IMF loans could hurt economic growth. Analysts have been expecting the package to be concluded this month but say the contours of any proposed assistance program are unclear. “There are questions if there will be any further devaluations, how much interest rates will be hiked, what taxation measures are expected of Pakistan, and will there be any further increase in electricity or gas prices?” said Saad Hashemy, Chief Economist for Pakistani brokerage house Topline Securities. The government of Prime Minister Imran Khan, who took power in August, has obtained temporary relief from close allies such as China and Saudi Arabia with short-term loans worth more than $10 billion to buffer foreign currency reserves and ease pressures on the country’s current account. But analysts have called an IMF bailout inevitable, with Pakistan also facing an increasing fiscal crunch ahead of the annual budget spending review for the next financial year starting July 1. Khan’s government is facing increasing public anger over rising utility prices, many of which have been subsidized by successive cash-strapped governments. Inflation was over 9.4 percent in March, its highest since November 2013, with strong increases in food and energy, the two most sensitive items for most consumers. The central bank forecasts growth at 3.5 to 4 percent in the 12 months to end-June, well short of a government target of 6.2 percent. The IMF paints a gloomier picture, predicting Pakistani growth of 2.9 percent in 2019 and 2.8 percent the following year. REUTERS.

"Dollar rises on strong data; euro, sterling tick lower","NEW YORK: The US dollar rose on strong producer price and jobless-claims data on Thursday while sterling was weaker after news of a Brexit delay and the euro dinged by Wednesday’s European Central Bank statement. The number of Americans filing initial applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a 49-1/2-year low last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength that could counter fears of a sharp slowdown in economic growth. Claims have declined for four straight weeks. The dollar was trading higher “off the back of a very low jobless claims number and fairly robust PPI numbers. Overall what you’re seeing is a shift into dollars on fading expectations for a rate cut later this year,” said Karl Schamotta, director of foreign exchange strategy and structured products at Cambridge Global Payments. The Fed on Wednesday released the minutes from its March 19-20 meeting, at which policymakers signaled they would not raise rates in 2019. US producer prices increased by the most in five months in March, the Labor Department reported, with its producer price index for final demand rising 0.6 percent in March, lifted by a surge in the cost of gasoline. Despite the top line increase, underlying wholesale inflation was tame. The dollar index was last up 0.09%, at 97.030, having retraced some of its earlier gains. The euro was modestly lower against the dollar after the European Central Bank hinted it was willing to leave interest rates alone amid trade tensions and signs of flagging growth. It was last down 0.04% at $1.1269. ECB President Mario Draghi underscored the risks facing the euro zone economy, supporting further stimulus to prevent the region from slipping into recession. Sterling was 0.1 percent lower, last at $1.308 after EU leaders extended the deadline for Britain to leave the European Union, suggesting fears remain about where Brexit is headed. “Concern around Brexit and the ECB’s increasingly dovish stance is weighing on euro and sterling,” said Schamotta. The advantages for sterling, as well as UK and European equities, include the removal of a near-term, no-deal Brexit. But that is offset by the prospects of UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s replacement, a general election and the threat to the UK economy of prolonged uncertainty. REUTERS.

Pakistan’s economic development may slow down in 2019: IMF,"ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Tuesday economic development of Pakistan may slow down in 2019 with a rise in unemployment as economic conditions of the country further decline. In a report titled World Economic Outlook 2019, IMF said the estimated Gross Development Product (GDP) growth will remain 2.9 percent in current year and will be 2.9 percent in 2020, in contrast with 5.2 percent previous year. The expected budget deficit of the country will remain 7.2 percent with tendency to increase in 2020 and inflation will likely to be 7.6 percent, in spite of projected 6 percent, according to IMF. IMF estimated that the current account deficit of the country would amount to 5.2 percent in current year and 4.3 percent next year with unemployment rate to be 6.2 percent this year. IMF asserted the need to take necessary measures to improve economic indicators. The report stated, “growth in the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan region is expected to decline to 1.5 percent in 2019, before recovering to about 3.2 percent in 2020. The outlook for the region is weighed down by multiple factors, including slower oil GDP growth in Saudi Arabia; ongoing macroeconomic adjustment challenges in Pakistan; US sanctions in Iran; and civil tensions and conflict across several other economies, including Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, where recovery from the collapse associated with the war is now expected to be slower than previously anticipated.” It further added, “the medium-term outlook for the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan region is largely shaped by the outlook for fuel prices, needed adjustment to correct macroeconomic imbalances in certain economies, and geopolitical tensions.” “In Pakistan, in the absence of further adjustment policies, growth is projected to remain subdued at about 2.5 percent, with continued external and fiscal imbalances weighing on confidence,” the report concluded.

"In FY2019-20, GDP growth of Pakistan might fell to 2.7 percent: World Bank","Pakistan’s Gross Domestic Product growth is expected to slow down by 3.4 percent in the fiscal year 2018-2019, from 5.8 percent of previous year to 2.7 percent in FY2019-20, revealing a broad-based decline in domestic demand as both monetary and fiscal policies have been constricted to enclose macroeconomic imbalances, the World Bank said in a report. The cause of expected slowdown in Pakistan’s GDP growth was cited to be macroeconomic imbalances, reflected in large fiscal and current account deficits as documented in the latest report titled, “South Asia Economic Focus, Exports Wanted.” The report said, “In Pakistan, external account pressure reduced international reserves to USD 6.6 billion (1.3 months of goods and services import coverage) by mid-January 2019. With short-term financing from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and China, international reserves increased to USD 10.5 billion (2.0 months of goods and services import coverage) at the end of March. Meanwhile, the government continues to negotiate a support package with the International Monetary Fund.” “The current account deficit continued to widen but stabilized over the course of last year and it stood at 5.2 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2018. The current account deficit reached 8.8 USD billion (3.3 percent of GDP) at the end of February 2019, compared to 11.4 USD billion (3.7 percent of GDP) the year before,” the report added. Looking upon the inflation, the report detects, “In Pakistan core inflation steadily rose throughout 2018, mostly due to currency pressures which made imported final and intermediate goods more expensive. It reached 8.3 percent (year over year) in December of last year, the highest value since January 2015… Consumer prices increased despite a strong decline in food prices.” “Inflation increased owing to exchange rate depreciation, demand side pressures and higher fuel prices. Consumer prices rose by 8.2 percent from February 2018 to February 2019, the highest rate in South Asia. Average inflation reached 7.0 percent in the period between October 2018 and February 2019, compared to 4.1 percent in the same period last year,” the report said. World Bank said, “Pakistan’s currency has continued to depreciate against its trading partners over the last six months. Pakistan’s real effective exchange rate, which is the average of its currency in relation to an index of other major currencies weighted by their relative trade shares and adjusted for inflation differentials, depreciated by nearly 5.5 percent from October 2018 to March of this year. The depreciation against its trading partners increases the price competitiveness of Pakistan’s exports in international markets and makes imports more expensive. Over time, such an adjustment of relative prices is needed if policies are put in place to improve the trade balance.” The report further elaborated that growth is expected to recover to 4 percent in FY21 as structural reforms take effect and macroeconomic conditions improve. Remittances flows are likely to support the current account balance next year. A more stable external environment will also support a pickup in economic activity starting from FY21. The trade deficit is projected to remain elevated during FY19, but to narrow in FY20 and FY21 as the impacts of currency depreciation, domestic demand compression, and other regulatory measures to curb imports set in. Illango Patchamuthu, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan had this to say, “Pakistan’s growth must be driven by investment and productivity, which will put an end to the boom and bust cycles that affect the country every few years, It is entirely possible for Pakistan to transform its regulatory environment and reduce the cost of doing business. On the revenue front, reforms to improve tax administration and widen the tax base are critical. Over the adjustment period and beyond, actions outlined in the recently announced Ehsaas Program can protect the poor and vulnerable through social safety nets and safeguarding public spending on health and education.” ",https://www.newsone.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/World-Bank.jpg,Business,"The cause of expected slowdown in Pakistan’s GDP growth was cited to be macroeconomic imbalances, reflected in large fiscal and current account deficits as documented in the latest report titled, “South Asia Economic Focus, Exports Wanted.” The report said, “In Pakistan, external account pressure reduced international reserves to USD 6.6 billion (1.3 months of goods and services import coverage) by mid-January 2019.",positive
Apple Music’s US subscriber count overtakes Spotify,"Apple Inc’s streaming music service overtook rival Spotify Technology SA in terms of paid subscribers in the United States, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. Apple’s service had 28 million subscribers as of the end of February compared with Spotify’s 26 million paid subscribers, the person said. Both companies charge $9.99 a month for subscriptions, though Spotify still has more total U.S. listeners than an Apple thanks to an ad-supported free tier of its service with fewer features. Analysts also believe Spotify has a stronger subscriber position than Apple outside the United States. Neither Apple nor Spotify disclose country-level listener data, and both firms declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Apple has overtaken Spotify on the metric. Apple’s streaming service is part of a broader push at the company to make money off subscriptions and services as iPhone sales slow. Last month the company announced a news, television and gaming subscriptions, as well as a credit card partnership with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Spotify likely still has more paying users than Apple Music, with 96 million premium subscribers and 207 million month active users as of its most recent earnings report in February. The company said in its report that it has 28.8 million premium subscribers and 62.1 million monthly active listeners in its North American region, which includes Canada but not Mexico. Apple does not regularly disclose how many subscribers it has, and the last official count – 50 million – came almost a year ago in May of 2018.

Kim Kardashian might become a lawyer soon,"LOS ANGELES: Reality star Kim Kardashian is studying to be a lawyer, inspired by her success in helping to win the release from US prisons of two women. Kardashian told Vogue magazine in an interview published on Wednesday that she has begun a four-year apprenticeship with a San Francisco-based law firm under a California program for those without formal qualifications. Kardashian, who dropped out of college, said she aims to take the bar exam in 2022. The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star said she made the decision last summer after visiting the White House and persuading President Donald Trump to commute a life sentence handed out to a 63-year-old woman in Tennessee for a first drug offense. “I just felt like I wanted to be able to fight for people who have paid their dues to society. I just felt like the system could be so different, and I wanted to fight to fix it, and if I knew more, I could do more,” Kardashian, 38, told Vogue. Kardashian helped to win clemency in January for another woman in Tennessee who had been convicted as a teenager of murdering a man who paid to have sex with her. Kardashian said her first year of the apprenticeship involved studying three subjects: criminal law, torts and contracts. “To me, torts is the most confusing, contracts the most boring, and crime law I can do in my sleep. Took my first test, I got a 100. Super easy for me,” she told Vogue. “The reading is what really gets me. It’s so time-consuming. The concepts I grasp in two seconds.” While best known for developing beauty and fashion products and showcasing her life with her sisters on the TV show “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” Kardashian has some powerful legal DNA. Her late father, Robert Kardashian, was a prominent Los Angeles lawyer who was part of the legal team representing football star OJ Simpson in his 1995 trial and acquittal for double murder. REUTERS.

‘Smallville’ actress Allison Mack pleads guilty in sex cult case,"NEW YORK: “Smallville” actress Allison Mack on Monday pleaded guilty to blackmailing two women as part of an alleged New York sex cult that prosecutors called a racketeering operation that carried out sex trafficking and other crimes. Mack, 36, entered her plea to racketeering and conspiracy charges before US District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, admitting that she coerced the two unnamed women into performing services by threatening to release damaging information about them. Fighting back tears, Mack said she had joined the organization, led by self-described spiritual guide Keith Raniere, a decade ago to find purpose in life. “Through it all, I believed that Keith Raniere’s intentions were to help people,” she said. “I was wrong. I now realize that I and others engaged in criminal conduct.” There was no mention at the plea hearing of any agreement by Mack to cooperate with prosecutors against Raniere, who is expected to go on trial later this month. Mack’s lawyers declined to provide any further details about her plea deal. Raniere, 58, was arrested on sex trafficking charges in March 2018, and is being held without bail. Mack was arrested the following month. Prosecutors accused Raniere of running a cult-like secret society within his organization, Nxivm (pronounced “Nexium”), in which women were branded with his initials, put on extremely restrictive diets and forced to have sex with him. Last month, prosecutors unsealed new charges accusing Raniere of sexually exploiting a minor and coercing her to produce child pornography. Raniere has pleaded not guilty. Marc Agnifilo, one of his lawyers, declined to comment on the case after Monday’s hearing. Agnifilo has previously said that his client’s sexual encounters with women in the organization were consensual, and denied the child pornography charges. Nxivm on its website calls itself “a community guided by humanitarian principles that seek to empower people and answer important questions about what it means to be human.” The website now carries a message saying that all “enrollment, curriculum and events” are canceled “until further notice,” adding that “we continue to believe in the value and importance of our work.” Two other people charged in the case, former Nxivm president Nancy Salzman and her daughter Lauren Salzman, previously pleaded guilty. Also charged alongside Raniere are Seagram liquor heiress Clare Bronfman and Nxivm member Kathy Russell, who have pleaded not guilty. “Smallville,” a television series that ran from 2001 to 2011, featured a young Clark Kent before he became famous as Superman. Mack played Chloe Sullivan, a close friend of the future Superman whose romantic feelings were not reciprocated. REUTERS.

Rising to the top: Ibne Ali pursuing his passion in ‘Rap’ genre,"By: |Syed Tazmeen Javed| It was my first year back in 2014, when I decided that the time has come to fulfill the promise I have made to my God All Mighty in primordial stage: To serve the Ahlulbayt(AS0 with my voice. The task was uneasy as I had no experience of recordings and how the things are managed in that process. When discussed to one of my friend– who is also a leading Photographer and Director Of Production in metropolis, he came with a spontaneous suggestion of utilizing a studio located in Malir (Karachi). He then took me on his bike which I am thankful to him for the generosity he showed at that particular time, picking me up from Sea View all the way to Malir. Till my last breath I will be thankful to him. The studio was located in a ‘Basement’ area with scarce resources. However, the owner of that studio was welcoming and supported the idea when I apprised him about my aspirations tof recording my fist ever Nauha. It was all a new experience, a break-down of high expectations that to record something was so easy. I remember, I managed to travel from my University to Malir which was not that easy. I had to return my home (Sea View) following the recording session in a bus. With limited amount of money and surely with the divine help, this was ultimately achieved. Moreover, then there was a menace of massive load shedding. The studio was not equipped with any proper substitute generator facility as I had to wait for 2 hours for the electricity to come. The process of recording started. Initially I used to struggle between finding rhythm on the beats. The entire process was amusing and tiring too. But my voice was noticed by a guy who was employed there in the studio and came to me bringing compliments and praises. He was adamant that he himself would record my 2nd Nauha(Elegy). I wondered why the guy is so keenly interested in a thing which he was not supposed to do. My recordist was different and the guy who had approached was not assigned to over look my recordings. But my apprehensions were proved wrong. That guy proved himself to be a true artist and a lover of art. He has had the inclinations towards rap/hip-hop genre. He used to write his own songs and produce his own music. Simultaneously along with his passion he used to work for his family day and night. He was eighteen then but was full of dreams. The guy name is Omer Ali and recently he changed his name to Ibne-Ali. He recorded My first ever Nauha Mera Dil Karbala, which up to this date is my most favorite Kalam.    This was his gift to me. I am thankful to him. His recording paved the way for me in the years to come. He was always in my prayers and a bit chat here and there was all we had in the last 4 years which I am apologetic to him. Recently while scrolling on YouTube I encountered his video where he is singing his rap song in his office at KFC. He was flanked by his colleagues, all supporting him. The video went viral on social media. I had tears in my eyes that a person with whom I started my aspirations, he after all hard work went through is now trending , MASHA ALLAH.  It was a pleasant surprise for me which was followed by interviews and appreciation by his friends circle.  Here is the link of Ibne-Ali Interview   It is unsurprising that we don’t value our hidden talents. I am not that familiar from Rap genre, but I know for sure that Ibne Ali’s talent is special. I would urge all music lovers to support this guy and give him a chance to work for the industry. Mark my words he can do miracles if given proper platform.

Souvenirs and secrets as ‘Game of Thrones’ cast walk last red carpet,"NEW YORK: The cast and creators of “Game of Thrones” walked their last red carpet together on Wednesday, recalling memories of their years working on the international hit television series. Dozens of actors, many of whom were unknown before the medieval fantasy series began in 2011, flew to New York ahead of the eighth and final season of the show, which arrives on HBO on April 14. Sophie Turner, who was just 14 when she began her role as Sansa Stark, said she would miss the months of filming outdoors in freezing weather in Northern Ireland. “Some of the fondest memories I have are of all of us snuggled up in warm coats trying to get warm,” she said. “That camaraderie that we’ve built from just being so like cold and so wet… they were the most exciting times because it was how we really bonded as a cast.” Turner said she had kept one of her character’s corsets as a souvenir. Pilou Asbaek (Euron Greyjoy) and Conleth Hill (Varys) said they kept some rings, while Richard Dormer held on to Beric Dondarrion’s trademark eye patch. “Game of Thrones” has won multiple Emmy awards and is HBO’s biggest hit ever with some 30 million viewers in the United States and an army of devoted fans worldwide. The series, set among warring families in the fictional kingdom of Westeros, is based on novels by George R.R. Martin in a series called “A Song of Ice and Fire.” Plot details of the final season have been kept strictly secret although filming started in October 2017. “This has been a year and a half we’ve been having to hide these. I can remember when I read the script I was like, you know, I wish I didn’t have this information in my head,” said Isaac Hempstead-Wright, who plays the visionary Bran Stark. Season 7, which was broadcast in 2017, saw the characters head towards a great battle over the Iron Throne while a zombie army of White Walkers, led by the undead Night King, march south and threaten mankind’s destruction. “I can tell you something. I’m probably the only guy with a happy end,” Asbaek said. The show has become known for killing off beloved characters, but many of the actors playing them, including Jason Momoa (Khal Drogo), Natalie Dormer (Margaery Tyrell) and Sean Bean (Ned Stark) turned up for Wednesday’s red carpet. “This is the last mile, the last carpet, the last premiere, this is the end,” said Kristofer Hivju, who plays raider Tormund Giantsbane. “I think everything has an end and this is the perfect way to end it.” REUTERS.

Apple all set to launch video streaming service,"SAN FRANCISCO/LOS ANGELES: Apple Inc is expected to finally lift the curtain on Monday on a secretive, years-long effort to build a television and movie offering designed to compete with big media companies and boost digital services revenue as iPhone sales taper. “It’s show time” is how the iPhone maker billed the affair slated for the Steve Jobs Theater at its Cupertino, California, headquarters. Analysts believe it will be the technology company’s first splashy launch event that will not feature new gadgets or hardware. Hollywood celebrities are likely to trek to Apple’s Cupertino home to greet the debut of a revamped Apple TV digital storefront. Apple has commissioned programming from A-list names such as Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg. The Apple original shows are expected to be offered alongside the option to subscribe to content from Viacom Inc and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp’s Starz, among others, sources have told Reuters. Apple will join a crowded field where rivals such as Amazon.com’s Prime Video and Netflix Inc have spent heavily to capture viewer attention and dollars with award-winning series and films. The big tech war for viewers ignited a consolidation wave among traditional media companies preparing to join the fray. Walt Disney Co, which bought 21st Century Fox, and AT&T Inc, which purchased Time Warner Inc, plan to launch or test new streaming video services this year. Apple’s jump into original entertainment signals a fundamental shift in its business. Sales of hardware money-makers the iPhone, iPad and Mac were either stagnant or flat in its most recent fiscal year. Without another category-defining new gadget announced to the public, Apple is expected to rely on selling subscriptions and services like video, music and hardware insurance. Revenue from its “services” segment – which includes the App Store, iCloud and content businesses such as Apple Music – grew 24 percent to $37.1 billion in fiscal 2018. The services segment accounted for only about 14 percent of Apple’s overall $265.6 billion in revenue, but investors have pinned their hopes for growth on the segment. Apple’s TV push has been cloaked in mystery. Even producers of Apple’s shows are unsure about many of the details about when and how audiences will be able to see their work. On Monday, Apple also is expected to unveil an Apple News subscription option featuring content from major publishers and a new credit card with Goldman Sachs to bolster Apple Pay. NOT TAKING ON NETFLIX While Apple plans to spend $2 billion on original shows this year and has hired Hollywood veterans to oversee them, it is unlikely to take on Netflix or Amazon directly by including libraries of older shows. Instead, its model is expected to more closely resemble the App Store, offering paid subscriptions to other media companies’ programming and keeping a cut of sales. Ahead of the launch, Apple negotiated deals that would let Apple bundle and sell networks at a discount, replicating a business model from the cable TV industry, one source familiar with the matter said. Apple’s goal, other sources have told Reuters, is to bring together television shows in one place to make it easier to find, buy and watch them. Apple has worked to make it easier to watch the shows on traditional television from manufacturers such as Sony Corp, VIZIO Inc, LG Electronics Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Apple’s pitch to Hollywood is that it has the potential to reach hundreds of millions of viewers. The company said in January there were 1.4 billion active Apple devices, 900 million of which are iPhones. It has positioned that as leverage against Netflix’s 139 million global customers and the 100 million subscribers to Amazon’s Prime shipping program, which includes the video service. But the Silicon Valley company has a history of making quick progress when coming from behind: It launched its Apple Music streaming service years after rival Spotify Technology SA but has garnered 50 million listeners, nearly half of Spotify’s 96 million premium subscribers. And Apple in January said its Apple News service had 85 million active users after being released less than four years ago. REUTERS.

‘Simpsons’ producer pulls episode featuring Michael Jackson,"An old episode of “The Simpsons” featuring the voice of Michael Jackson is being pulled from all future broadcasts, the show’s producer told a newspaper, following a documentary about alleged child abuse by the late pop star. “It feels clearly the only choice to make,” James L. Brooks was quoted as telling the Wall Street Journal. The long-running cartoon show featured Jackson in 1991, during its third series, in a episode called “Stark Raving Dad”. He voiced a character in a psychiatric ward who believed he was the pop star. Media representatives for “The Simpsons” were not immediately available for further comment. In the documentary, “Leaving Neverland”, two adult men say they were befriended by Jackson and abused by him from the ages of 7 and 10 in the early 1990s. It prompted a mixture of horror and disbelief when it ran on U.S. cable channel HBO on Sunday and Monday. Some radio stations in Canada and the Netherlands stopped playing Jackson’s music. Jackson’s family called the documentary and news coverage of the accusations a “public lynching” and said he was “100 percent innocent.” His estate filed a lawsuit against HBO in February, saying the program breached an agreement that the cable channel would not disparage Jackson. The “Thriller” singer, who died in 2009, was acquitted in 2005 of charges of molesting a 13-year-old boy, unrelated to the documentary, at his Neverland ranch in California. In 1994, he settled a sexual abuse lawsuit concerning another 13-year-old boy. Reuters.

Google blocks TikTok in India after court order,"NEW DELHI: Google has blocked access to the hugely popular video app TikTok in India to comply with a state court’s directive to prohibit its downloads, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. The move comes hours after a court in southern Tamil Nadu state refused a request by China’s Bytedance Technology to suspend a ban on its TikTok app, putting its future in one of its key markets in doubt. The state court had on April 3 asked the federal government to ban TikTok, saying it encouraged pornography and made child users vulnerable to sexual predators. Its ruling came after an individual launched a public interest litigation calling for a ban. The federal government had sent a letter to Apple and Google to abide by the state court’s order, according to an IT ministry official. The app was still available on Apple’s platforms late on Tuesday, but was no longer available on Google’s Play store in India. Google said in a statement it does not comment on individual apps but adheres to local laws. Apple did not respond to requests for comment, while TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Google’s move.

Google blocks TikTok in India after court order,"NEW DELHI: Google has blocked access to the hugely popular video app TikTok in India to comply with a state court’s directive to prohibit its downloads, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. The move comes hours after a court in southern Tamil Nadu state refused a request by China’s Bytedance Technology to suspend a ban on its TikTok app, putting its future in one of its key markets in doubt. The state court had on April 3 asked the federal government to ban TikTok, saying it encouraged pornography and made child users vulnerable to sexual predators. Its ruling came after an individual launched a public interest litigation calling for a ban. The federal government had sent a letter to Apple and Google to abide by the state court’s order, according to an IT ministry official. The app was still available on Apple’s platforms late on Tuesday, but was no longer available on Google’s Play store in India. Google said in a statement it does not comment on individual apps but adheres to local laws. Apple did not respond to requests for comment, while TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Google’s move.

"On Saturn’s moon Titan, plentiful lakeside views, but with liquid methane","WASHINGTON: Scientists on Monday provided the most comprehensive look to date at one of the solar system’s most exotic features: prime lakeside property in the northern polar region of Saturn’s moon Titan – if you like lakes made of stuff like liquid methane. Using data obtained by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft before that mission ended in 2017 with a deliberate plunge into Saturn, the scientists found that some of frigid Titan’s lakes of liquid hydrocarbons in this region are surprisingly deep while others may be shallow and seasonal. Titan and Earth are the solar system’s two places with standing bodies of liquid on the surface. Titan boasts lakes, rivers and seas of hydrocarbons: compounds of hydrogen and carbon like those that are the main components of petroleum and natural gas. The researchers described landforms akin to mesas towering above the nearby landscape, topped with liquid lakes more than 300 feet (100 meters) deep comprised mainly of methane. The scientists suspect the lakes formed when surrounding bedrock chemically dissolved and collapsed, a process that occurs with a certain type of lake on Earth. The scientists also described “phantom lakes” that during wintertime appeared to be wide but shallow ponds – perhaps only a few inches (cm) deep – but evaporated or drained into the surface by springtime, a process taking seven years on Titan. The findings represented further evidence about Titan’s hydrological cycle, with liquid hydrocarbons raining down from clouds, flowing across its surface and evaporating back into the sky. This is comparable to Earth’s water cycle. Because of Titan’s complex chemistry and distinctive environments, scientists suspect it potentially could harbor life, in particular in its subsurface ocean of water, but possibly in the surface bodies of liquid hydrocarbons. “Titan is a very fascinating object in the solar system, and every time we look carefully at the data we find out something new,” California Institute of Technology planetary scientist Marco Mastrogiuseppe said. Titan, with a diameter of 3,200 miles (5,150 km), is the solar system’s second largest moon, behind only Jupiter’s Ganymede. It is bigger than the planet Mercury. “Titan is the most Earth-like body in the solar system. It has lakes, canyons, rivers, dune fields of organic sand particles about the same size as silica sand grains on Earth,” Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory planetary scientist Shannon MacKenzie said. The research was published in the journal Nature Astronomy. REUTERS.

"First 3D print of heart with human tissue, vessels uncovered","TEL AVIV: Scientists in Israel unveiled a 3D print of a heart with human tissue and vessels on Monday, calling it a first and a “major medical breakthrough” that advances possibilities for transplants. While it remains a far way off, scientists hope one day to be able to produce hearts suitable for transplant into humans as well as patches to regenerate defective hearts. The heart produced by researchers at Tel Aviv University is about the size of a rabbit’s. It marked “the first time anyone anywhere has successfully engineered and printed an entire heart replete with cells, blood vessels, ventricles and chambers,” said Tal Dvir, who led the project.  “People have managed to 3D-print the structure of a heart in the past, but not with cells or with blood vessels,” he said. But the scientists said many challenges remain before fully working 3D printed hearts will be available for transplant into patients. Journalists were shown a 3D print of a heart about the size of a cherry at Tel Aviv University on Monday as the researchers announced their findings, published in the peer-reviewed journal Advanced Science. Researchers must now teach the printed hearts “to behave” like real ones. The cells are currently able to contract but do not yet have the ability to pump. Then they plan to transplant them into animal models, hopefully in about a year, said Dvir. “Maybe, in 10 years, there will be organ printers in the finest hospitals around the world, and these procedures will be conducted routinely,” he said. But he said hospitals would likely start with simpler organs than hearts. Producing ‘ink’ In its statement announcing the research, Tel Aviv University called it a “major medical breakthrough.” A biopsy of fatty tissue was taken from patients that was used in the development of the “ink” for the 3D print. First, patient-specific cardiac patches were created followed by the entire heart, the statement said.  Using the patient’s own tissue is important to eliminate the risk of an implant provoking an immune response and being rejected, Dvir said. Challenges that remain include how to expand the cells to have enough tissue to recreate a human-sized heart, he said. Current 3D printers are also limited by the size of their resolution and another challenge will be figuring out how to print all small blood vessels. 3D printing has opened up possibilities in numerous fields, provoking both promise and controversy. The technology has developed to include 3D prints of everything from homes to guns. AFP.

"Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp working again after outages","Facebook Inc said it restored services on Sunday after some users could not access its social networking site, photo-sharing network Instagram and messaging app WhatsApp. However, Facebook did not specify the cause or scope of the outages. “Earlier today, some people may have experienced trouble connecting to the family of apps. The issue has since been resolved; we’re sorry for any inconvenience,” a Facebook spokesman told Reuters. The issue comes after Facebook experienced one of its longest outages in March, when some users around the globe could not access Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp for more than 24 hours. On Sunday, Downdetector.com indicated that there were more than 12,000 incidents of people reporting issues with Facebook at its peak.

5G-connected cows test milking parlor of the future,"SHEPTON MALLET: They may look like regular cows, but a herd of Friesian dairy cattle at a British farm are internet pioneers and they are enjoying the benefits of 5G connectivity before you. Cisco Systems Inc, which is developing network infrastructure for the emerging technology, has set up 5G testbeds to trial wireless and mobile connectivity in three rural locations. 5G promises super-fast connections, which evangelists say will transform the way we live our lives, enabling everything from self-driving cars to augmented-reality glasses and downloading a feature-length film to your phone in seconds. While it is being used in pockets of pilot studies around the world, the first near-nationwide coverage is not expected in countries such as China, Japan or the United States until 2023, according to industry analysts. For the cows, among the 5G-connected gadgets they are wearing is a collar that controls a robotic milking system. When the cow feels ready to be milked it will approach machine gates that will automatically open. The device recognizes the individual to precisely latch on to its teats for milking, while the cow munches on a food reward. At the government-funded Agricultural Engineering Precision Innovation Centre (Agri-EPI Centre) in Shepton Mallet, in southwest England, around 50 of the 180-strong herd is fitted with the 5G smart collars and health-monitoring ear tags. The gadgets do not harm the cows and the monitoring allows handlers to see any signs of distress. “We are testing the ability of 5G to transmit the data from our sensors much quicker, and not via the farm’s PC and a slow broadband internet connection,” said Duncan Forbes, Project Manager at the Agri-Epi Centre “And the significance of that is it means that this sort of technology could be taken up … not just on farms but on rural communities right across the country.” The working dairy, set up by Agri-EPI with the support of Britain’s innovation agency, uses a range of technology; including automated brushes that rotate when the cow rubs up against them, sensor-operated curtains that open depending on the weather, and a smart feeding system that automatically delivers food in the barn via ceiling-mounted rails. “We can connect every cow, we can connect every animal on this farm,” Cisco’s Nick Chrissos said. “That’s what 5G can do for farming — really unleash the power that we have within this farm, everywhere around the UK and everywhere around the world.” REUTERS.

Remarkable photo of black hole released in astrophysics breakthrough,"WASHINGTON: An international scientific team on Wednesday announced a milestone in astrophysics – the first-ever photo of a black hole – using a global network of telescopes to gain insight into celestial objects with gravitational fields so strong no matter or light can escape. The team’s observations of the black hole at the center of Messier 87, a massive galaxy in the nearby Virgo galaxy cluster, lend strong support to the theory of general relativity put forward in 1915 by physicist Albert Einstein to explain the laws of gravity and their relation to other natural forces. The research was conducted by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project, an international collaboration begun in 2012 to try to directly observe the immediate environment of a black hole using a global network of Earth-based telescopes. The announcement was made in simultaneous news conferences in Washington, Brussels, Santiago, Shanghai, Taipei and Tokyo.  “We have achieved something presumed to be impossible just a generation ago,” said astrophysicist Sheperd Doeleman, director of the Event Horizon Telescope at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian. This black hole resides about 54 million light-years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). Black holes, phenomenally dense celestial entities, are extraordinarily difficult to observe despite their great mass. A black hole’s event horizon is the point of no return beyond which anything – stars, planets, gas, dust and all forms of electromagnetic radiation – gets swallowed into oblivion. “This is a huge day in astrophysics,” said US National Science Foundation Director France Córdova. “We’re seeing the unseeable.” The fact that black holes do not allow light to escape makes viewing them difficult. The scientists look for a ring of light – disrupted matter and radiation circling at tremendous speed at the edge of the event horizon – around a region of darkness representing the actual black hole. This is known as the black hole’s shadow or silhouette.  Astrophysicist Dimitrios Psaltis of the University of Arizona, the EHT project scientist, said, “The size and shape of the shadow matches the precise predictions of Einstein’s general theory of relativity, increasing our confidence in this century-old theory.” “Imaging a black hole is just the beginning of our effort to develop new tools that will enable us to interpret the massively complex data that nature gives us,” Psaltis added. The project’s researchers obtained the first data in April 2017 using telescopes in the US states of Arizona and Hawaii as well as in Mexico, Chile, Spain and Antarctica. Since then, telescopes in France and Greenland have been added to the global network. The global network of telescopes has essentially created a planet-sized observational dish. REUTERS.

"Facebook, Google defend efforts to remove hate speech before Congress","WASHINGTON: Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google unit on Tuesday defended their efforts to remove hate speech from social media sites amid questions from lawmakers in an appearance before the US House Judiciary Committee. Representative Jerrold Nadler, who chairs the panel, said white nationalist groups target communities of color and religious minorities through social media. “Efforts by media companies to counter this surge have fallen short, and social network platforms continue to be used as ready avenues to spread dangerous white nationalist speech,” Nadler said at the hearing. Social media firms use algorithms and human reviewers to remove hateful speech. In March, the chair of the House Homeland Security committee wrote top executives of Facebook, Google, Twitter Inc and Microsoft Corp, urging them to do a better job of removing violent political content following the live-streaming of a New Zealand mass shooting. Neil Potts, a public policy director at Facebook, told lawmakers that Facebook in March “instituted a prohibition on praise, support, and representation of white nationalism and white separatism.” Google wants to be a “part of the solution,” company executive Alexandria Walden said at Tuesday’s hearing, adding that Google has invested “heavily in machines and people to quickly identify and remove content that violates our policies against incitement to violence and hate speech.” Google’s YouTube, which streamed the hearing live, disabled comments on the hearing after numerous hateful and racist postings. In November, the FBI said US hate crimes jumped 17 percent in 2017, with a 37 percent spike in anti-Semitic attacks. Ellen Hershenov, senior vice president for policy at Anti-Defamation League, told lawmakers the “internet is forcing us to reassess our understanding of how violence may be inspired by such hateful echo chambers.” Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the panel, denounced white nationalism. “Free expression, free press and blind justice,” he added, are “the very things that foster diversity and deter intellectually bankrupt ideologies like white nationalism.” In response to suggestions social media companies discriminate against conservative viewpoints, Potts said Facebook errs “on the side of allowing more speech.” “We want to give people the voice but we do have to draw a line somewhere,” he noted. Representative Cedric Richmond, a Democrat, said it was important to prevent social media users from preying on weak people to incite violence. “Just because you are upset with your station in life, and sitting in your momma’s basement in your boxers you don’t get to spew hate that you know will incite violence because you can hide behind anonymity,” Richmond said.

Facebook to clearly explain how it uses consumer data,"BRUSSELS: Facebook has bowed to pressure from the European Commission and consumer authorities by revising its terms, making it clear what it does with users’ data and taking responsibility when data has been mishandled by third parties. The world’s largest social network is under fire on both sides of the Atlantic over a number of privacy-related issues that have exposed the passwords of millions of users. The European Commission said the changes in comprehensive and plain language mean users will now see how Facebook uses their data to develop profiling activities and target advertising to finance itself. “Now, users will clearly understand that their data is used by the social network to sell targeted ads,” Commission Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said in a statement.

Facebook launches WhatsApp Business for iPhones,"Facebook Inc on Thursday launched a business version of its WhatsApp messaging app for Apple Inc’s iOS, more than a year after the service was rolled out for Android users. WhatsApp Business will be available for free downloads from the App Store in Brazil, Germany, Indonesia, India, Mexico, the UK and the United States starting Thursday and will be rolled out around the world in the coming weeks, WhatsApp said here in a blog post. The app, which allows small businesses to communicate with customers through the platform, currently has over 5 million users. As part of its move to make money from WhatsApp, the company had said in August that it would start charging businesses for sending marketing and customer service messages at a fixed rate for confirmed delivery, ranging from 0.5 cents to 9 cents per message depending on the country. Facebook has encouraged messaging conversations between businesses and consumers since at least 2016 but has not disclosed its revenue from the efforts. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has increasingly shifted the company’s focus to messaging and private chats and last month said Facebook would encrypt conversations on more of its messaging services, while making them compatible across platforms.

Facebook’s Zuckerberg confident of stopping interference in 2020 campaign,"Facebook Inc’s Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg is confident the world’s biggest social network will do better in 2020 at stopping “bad actors” from manipulating the US presidential election. “We’ve learned a lot since 2016, where, obviously, we were behind where we needed to be on defenses for nation states trying to interfere,” he said in a “Good Morning America” interview released on Thursday. “These aren’t things that you ever fully solve, right? They’re ongoing arms races, where we need to make sure that our systems stay ahead of the sophisticated bad actors, who are just always going to try to game them.” US intelligence agencies say there was an extensive Russian cyber-influence operation during the 2016 campaign aimed at helping Donald Trump, a Republican, defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations. Zuckerberg said here the social media giant had implemented a lot of different measures since 2016 to verify any advertiser who is running a political ad and create an archive so anyone could see what advertisers are running, who they are targeting and how much they are paying. Advertising practices at Facebook, the world’s largest social network with 2.7 billion users and $56 billion in annual revenue, have been in the spotlight for two years amid growing discontent over its approach to privacy and user data. The company said in a congressional testimony last year that Russian agents created 129 events on the network during the 2016 US election campaign, shedding more light on Russia’s purported disinformation drive aimed at voters. “At this point, (we) have probably some of the most-advanced systems of any company or government in the world for preventing the kind of tactics that Russia and now other countries, as well, have tried,” Zuckerberg said. Asked if he could guarantee that there would not be interference in the election, Zuckerberg said, “What I can guarantee is that they’re definitely going to try.” REUTERS.

Facebook discloses the algorithm behind news feed,"LONDON: Facebook is lifting the lid on the algorithm that decides which posts appear in its news feed, as part of a drive to be more transparent and offer greater control to users. The feature “Why am I seeing this post?”, being rolled out from Monday, offers some insight into the tens of thousands of inputs used by the social network to rank stories, photos and video in the news feed, the foundation of the platform. “The basic thing that this tool does is let people see why they are seeing a particular post in their news feed, and it helps them access the actions they might want to take if they want to change that,” Facebook’s Head of News Feed John Hegeman told reporters on Monday. After a series of privacy scandals, Facebook needs to regain users’ trust as it prepares to roll out a single messaging service combining Facebook messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram that could make it even more central to users’ communications. The new news feed feature will show users the data that connect them to a particular type of post, Hegeman said, for example that they are friends with the poster and they’ve liked their posts more than others, they’ve frequently commented on that type of post before, or that the post is popular with users with the same interests. It will detail some of the interactions that lead the algorithm to reach its conclusion, he said, although it will not show all of the thousands of inputs that influence the decision. “We’ve tried to really focus on the signals that are most important and play the biggest role in what causes people to see a post or not,” Hegeman said. “We don’t think this is going to solve everything on the theme of transparency but we think this is an important step.” Facebook developed the new tool with research groups in New York, Denver, Paris and Berlin, he said, and as a result of feedback Facebook has made it easy for users to access tools to control what is in the news feed themselves. Facebook is also updating its “Why Am I Seeing this Ad?” feature launched a few years ago with additional details, Hegeman said, such as explaining how ads work that target customers using email lists. The company shifted its strategy for its centrepiece news feed in early 2018 when it decided to prioritize posts from family and friends and downgrade non-advertising content from publishers and brands.

New Australian laws could see social media execs jailed over terror images,"Australia pledged Saturday to introduce new laws that could see social media executives jailed and tech giants fined billions for failing to remove extremist material from their platforms. The tough new legislation will be brought to parliament next week as Canberra pushes for social media companies to prevent their platforms from being “weaponised” by terrorists in the wake of the Christchurch mosque attacks. Facebook said it “quickly” removed a staggering 1.5 million videos of the white supremacist massacre livestreamed on the social media platform. A 17-minute video of the March 15 rampage that claimed the lives of 50 people was widely available online and experts said was easily retrievable several hours after the attack. “Big social media companies have a responsibility to take every possible action to ensure their technology products are not exploited by murderous terrorists,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement. Morrison, who met with a number of tech firms Tuesday — including Facebook, Twitter and Google — said Australia would encourage other G20 nations to hold social media firms to account. Attorney-General Christian Porter said the new laws would make it a criminal offence for platforms not to quickly take down “abhorrent violent material” like terror attacks, murder or rape. Executives could face up to three years in prison for failing to do so, he added, while social media platforms — whose annual revenues can stretch into the tens of billions — would face fines of up to ten percent of their annual turnover. “Mainstream media that broadcast such material would be putting their licence at risk and there is no reason why social media platforms should be treated any differently,” Porter said. The government was so far “underwhelmed” by the response from tech giants at their Tuesday meeting with Morrison, communications minister Mitch Fifield told reporters Saturday. But cyber-security expert Nigel Phair, from the University of New South Wales, cast doubt over the ability of proposed Australian laws to impose jail time. “The penalty is only for Australian domiciled executives, and on the whole they´re marketing executives, not those responsible for running and maintaining the platform,” he told broadcaster SBS earlier this week.

Such capabilities have raised fears of the weaponisation of space and setting off a race between rival powers. “Some time ago, our scientists, shot down a live satellite 300 kilometres away in space, in low-earth orbit,” Modi said, calling it a historic feat. “India has made an unprecedented achievement today,” he said, speaking in Hindi. “India registered its name as a space power.” Modi faces a general election next month. He went on Twitter earlier to announce his plan for a national broadcast, saying he had an important announcement to make. India has had a space programme for years, making earth imaging satellites and launch capabilities as a cheaper alternative to Western programmes. Brahma Chellaney, a security expert at New Delhi’s Centre of Policy Research, said the United States, Russia and China were pursuing anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons. “Space is being turned into a battlefront, making counter-space capabilities critical. In this light, India’s successful ‘kill’ with an ASAT weapon is significant.” No comment was immediately available from old rival Pakistan. There was also no immediate reaction from China’s foreign or defence ministries.

Facebook fixes fault that displayed millions of user passwords to employees,"Facebook Inc said on Thursday it has resolved a glitch that exposed passwords of millions of users stored in readable format within its internal systems to its employees. The passwords were accessible to as many as 20,000 Facebook employees and dated back as early as 2012, cyber security blog KrebsOnSecurity, which first reported said in its report. “These passwords were never visible to anyone outside of Facebook and we have found no evidence to date that anyone internally abused or improperly accessed them,” the company said. KrebsOnSecurity, citing a senior Facebook employee, said the an internal investigation by the company so far indicates that between 200 million and 600 million Facebook users may have had their account passwords stored in plain text. Facebook said the issue was discovered in January as part of a routine security review. Majority of the affected were users of Facebook Lite, a version of the social media app largely used by people in regions with lower connectivity. The social network is also probing the causes of a series of security failures, in which employees built applications that logged unencrypted password data for Facebook users, the report said. “We estimate that we will notify hundreds of millions of Facebook Lite users, tens of millions of other Facebook users, and tens of thousands of Instagram users,” the company said.

Dubai’s ‘Quranic Park’ draws on Islam’s Holy text,"DUBAI: A new park that uses gardens and landscaping to tell stories from Islam’s sacred text has opened in Dubai, offering locals and tourists a day out with a religious twist. Quranic Park attracted some 100,000 people in its first week, officials say, feeding demand for religious attractions in the United Arab Emirates where Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque is a top destination for visitors. The educational park, which seeks to attract Muslims and non-Muslims alike, features 12 gardens, a “Cave of Miracles,” and a split lake symbolizing Moses parting the Red Sea.  Trees bearing grapes, figs, pomegranates and olives dot the park’s 64 hectares, highlighting the medical and scientific uses of plants mentioned in the Quran and sunnah, the teachings of the Prophet Mohammad (PBUH).  “My children had learned about these plants, and they had some questions about the Quran and the miracles,” said Emirati visitor Omar al-Kaabi. “Praise God we got some answers,” he said, standing inside the greenhouse that holds some of the plants. Visitors to the cave can learn about the story of Jesus making a bird from clay and six other prophetic miracles mentioned in the Quran, using 3D map and hologram displays.  “It’s a nice idea, right at the heart of our Islamic religion,” said Anan al-Hourani, another visitor who brought his daughters to the park on a sunny Saturday afternoon. “At the same time, it’s recreational, with the lovely gardens, greenery and trees,” he said.

‘Egg Boy’ escapes with caution for egging far-right Australian senator,"An Australian teenager lauded worldwide for egging a far-right senator who made offensive comments about the Christchurch mosque attacks was let off with a police caution for the incident on Tuesday. William Connolly, now better known as “Egg Boy”, cracked an egg on the head of Fraser Anning during a March 16 press conference, prompting the senator to hit him several times in the face. Take a look: In pictures: Heartbroken New Zealanders mourn victims lost to Christchurch mass shooting The controversial politician had a day earlier drawn international condemnation when he blamed the attacks in New Zealand that killed 50 people at two mosques last month on immigration. Connolly’s act spawned viral memes and drew support from around the world, with a GoFundMe page raising more than Aus$80,000 (US$57,000) to help with any legal fees and “more eggs”. The 17-year-old said he would donate money raised to the victims of the attacks. Victoria state police said after investigating footage of the incident they would not be pressing charges against Connolly. “The 17-year-old Hampton boy has been issued with an official caution in relation to the incident,” police said in a statement. They said Anning had also escaped charges. “On assessment of all the circumstances, the 69-year-old’s actions were treated as self-defence and there was no reasonable prospect of conviction,” police said. Several men could be seen pinning Connolly to the ground after the egging. Police said they had charged a 20-year-old man with assault following the incident. Anning, who was elected in 2017 by a fluke of Australia’s proportional voting system, has refused to apologise for his remarks and was last week censured for his “ugly and divisive” comments by his parliamentary peers.

Pope criticizes building walls to keep migrants out,"ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE: Pope Francis said Sunday political leaders who want walls and other barriers to keep migrants out “will end up becoming prisoners of the walls they build”. The pope made his comments to reporters aboard the plane returning from Morocco in response to a question about migration in general and about US President Donald Trump’s threat to shut down the southern border with Mexico. “Builders of walls, be they made of razor wire or bricks, will end up becoming prisoners of the walls they build,” he said. Francis, who did not mention Trump in his response, has sparred with the US president before over migration, which was a theme of several questions on the plane as well as during the trip to Morocco. Trump has declared a national emergency to justify redirecting money earmarked for the military to pay for his promised US-Mexico border wall. “I realize that with this problem (of migration), a government has a hot potato in its hands, but it must be resolved differently, humanely, not with razor wire,” the Argentine-born pope said on the plane. Addressing Moroccan leaders on Saturday, Francis said problems of migration would never be resolved by physical barriers but instead required social justice and correcting the world’s economic imbalances. “With fear, we will not move forward, with walls, we will remain closed within these walls,” he said on Sunday. Besides the United States, migration has again risen to the fore of national political debates in a number of North African and European countries. On the plane, Francis repeated some of the key points of his views on migration. He said wealthy countries should help eliminate the root causes of migration such as poverty, war, and political instability. Migrants should be accepted, protected and integrated and if a country cannot handle the numbers, the migrants should be distributed among other countries, he said. Reuters.

Pakistan leaps eight spots on UN happier countries index,"KARACHI: Pakistanis may indulge in numerous tribulations every day, but they cheerfully get ahead of those tribulations – at least that’s what United Nations World Happiness Index implies. The latest rankings see Pakistan leap eight spots from 2018 to become 67th happiest nation of the world. The 2019 report –which outlines countries’ progression since 2005 – also places Pakistan among the top 20 gainers ranked on the index. Adversary India was ranked among 20 biggest losers after it plummeted seven spots from previous year to 140 on the list. Just like previous year, Pakistan stayed the happiest country in South Asia, trail by Bhutan at 95. Other Asian countries on the list included: Nepal 100, Bangladesh 125, Sri Lanka 130, and Afghanistan, the least happiest Asian country, ranked 154. The top 5 spot was held by Scandinavian countries, continuing from last year, with Finland becoming the most happiest nation of the world, ranked #1, followed by Denmark and Norway. Top ten countries were Iceland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, New Zealand, Canada and Austria  South Sudan found themselves ranked 156, declared the unhappiest country of the world where, around 60% of population is grappling with food uncertainty in a post civil war region. The survey grades 157 nations by the extent of happiness their citizens identify themselves to be and every year, happiness is appraised by the usage of different markers. The current survey centered on six variables that sustain welfare, such as income per capita, life span, social support, independence, magnanimity and corruption. While the measure of happiness has been successfully conducted in the seventh consecutive year, the project is not without its detractors as they showed uncertainty at the ‘quantification’ of a feeling as intangible as happiness can be done. While some call attention to increasing suicide rates widespread in the urbanized nations with the constantly raising reliance on anti-depressants in countries such as Denmark and Iceland. Report is conceived with keeping emerging science of happiness in mind, writers of the report claim. They further added, ““[It shows] that the quality of people’s lives can be coherently, reliably, and validly assessed by a variety of subjective well-being measures, collectively referred to then and in subsequent reports as happiness.” The falling altitude of happiness all across the world in spite of persisting economic development, in part elucidated by descending status amid population-dense nations such as United States, Egypt and India is also emphasized by the report. Concluding that happiness and life fulfillment in terms of sole economic prosperity is not sufficient. Pakistan’s advancement on the index  Last year, Pakistan was ranked 75, accelerated from 80 in 2018 and making a leap to 65 this year. Index indicated that residents have been reporting raising fulfillment in all six categories described to measure happiness.
