Miftah Ismail granted interim bail in LNG scam,"
iISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday approved interim bail of former minister for finance Miftah Ismail on a petition he had filed in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) case.
Ismail, in his petition, had requested the IHC to restrain the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) from arresting him and sought a pre-arrest bail.

He expressed apprehensions that NAB might arrest him which would be disgraceful and humiliating for him.
“NAB is conducting a baseless inquiry against me. It is subjecting me to political victimisation,” he had stated.
The apex court on September 10, 2018 directed the NAB to complete the inquiry against former premier Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Miftah Ismail and others for the alleged corruption in the LNG contract.
As the minister for petroleum and natural resources, he has been accused of granting contract on LNG Terminal to ETPL, Tri-partial agreement, LSA with EETPL and LNG import from Qatar etc.

It was also observed that this contract had allegedly caused a loss of billions of rupees to the national exchequer.

According to diplomatic sources, officials from Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Religious Affairs and Federal Works Organisation (FWO) from both sides are attending the dialogues. Matters pertaining to construction of road, fencing and maps are being discussed in the meeting.

In November 2018, Pakistan offered India the building of the corridor for Sikh pilgrims for visiting the Gurudwara at Kartarpur where the founder of Sikhism – Guru Nanak lived for 18 years.

The project, with 50 percent of the work already done, is being anticipated to be completed just before the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak in 2019 with a community-wide groundbreaking ceremony for Sikh pilgrims at the Gurdwara in Kartarpur Sahib.

Later, the building of a passenger terminal building (PTB complex) at the cost of Rs190 crores was approved, which will be able to handle immigration and customs clearance facilities for5000 pilgrims every day. In the second phase, a hospital and accommodation for temporary staying will also be built. A bridge over Ravi river will also be built for crossing of pilgrims.

The corridor can pave a way for ""facilitating and fortifying"" people-to-people bonds of the two countries.

Besides, India has approved Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur as the coordinates of Zero Point (crossing point) for the opening of the Kartarpur corridor along the International Border with Pakistan. It has been decided to establish the Kartarpur corridor from Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur district in Punjab to the International Border.

On March 7, PM Imran Khan had directed the Frontier Works Organization (FWO) to ensure timely completion of the project on Pakistani side of the border.

The much-awaited corridor will connect Darbar Sahib in Pakistan’s Kartarpur – the final resting place of Sikh faith’s founder Guru Nanak Dev – with Dera Baba Nanak shrine in India’s Gurdaspur district and facilitate visa-free movement of Indian Sikh pilgrims, who will have to just obtain a permit to visit Kartarpur Sahib. ",,pakistan,"On March 7, PM Imran Khan had directed the Frontier Works Organization (FWO) to ensure timely completion of the project on Pakistani side of the border.",neutral

""We are still carrying on, thank God. What else can we do?"" said Mohamed Taha, 23, in a street where students still packed a nearby school. Cafes and shops also remained open and busy.
Foreign powers are worried but unable to present a united front over the latest flare-up in the cycle of anarchy and warfare that has gripped Libya since dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011.
The conflict has brought a growing humanitarian toll - 174 people, 756 injured and 18,250 displaced according to latest United Nations tallies - and sunk for now an international peace plan.
It threatens to disrupt oil flows, foment migration across the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, and allow jihadists to exploit the chaos.
Qatar said an existing U.N. arms embargo on Libya should be strictly enforced, to prevent Haftar, 75, from receiving arms.
The Benghazi-based Haftar enjoys the backing of Egypt, the United Arab Einmirates and Saudi Arabia, who view him as an anchor to restore stability and combat Islamist militants. Those three nations cut ties with Qatar in 2017, accusing it of support for militants and Iran.
Qatar s Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told Italian daily La Repubblica that a postponed U.N. peace conference should be rescheduled and Haftar s troops forced to withdraw.
The arms embargo must be implemented ""to prevent those countries that have been providing ammunitions and state-of-the-art weapons from continuing to do so,"" he said.
Past U.N. reports say the UAE and Egypt have both supplied Haftar with arms and aircraft, giving him air superiority among Libya s multiple factions. East Libyan authorities say Qatar and Turkey back rival, Islamist-leaning factions in western Libya.
 

UN MAY DEMAND CEASEFIRE

The Gulf diplomatic divisions echo those in Europe, where former colonial ruler Italy and France have sparred over Libya.
Paris has given Haftar support in the past, viewing him as the best bet to end the chaos since a NATO-backed rebellion to end Gaddafi s murderous four-decade rule.
Italy, with considerable oil interests in the OPEC member, supports the Tripoli government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj and was furious with French reluctance to back a recent European Union resolution urging Haftar to halt his advance.
Nevertheless, Serraj has managed to keep the LNA at bay, thanks largely to armed groups who have rushed to aid them from other western Libyan factions.
The U.N. Security Council is considering a British-drafted resolution that would demand a ceasefire and urge all nations with influence over the warring parties to ensure compliance.
The 15-member council has expressed concern but been unable so far to issue a more formal statement, diplomats said, as Russia objected to a reference to the LNA while Washington said it could not agree a text that did not mention Haftar s forces.
Though Haftar presents himself as a champion against what he calls terrorism, opponents cast him as a would-be dictator in the mould of Gaddafi. About 70 people protested against him at the central Algiers Square in Tripoli on Tuesday.
""We are against Haftar and military rule,"" said demonstrator Assam Dirbiq.
Haftar was among officers who helped Gaddafi rise to power in 1969, but fell out with him during a war with Chad in the 1980s. He was taken prisoner by the Chadians, rescued by the CIA, and lived for about 20 years in Virginia before returning in 2011 to join other rebels in the uprising against Gaddafi.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-16-19/news_big_images/487314_45231675.jpg,world,"Nevertheless, Serraj has managed to keep the LNA at bay, thanks largely to armed groups who have rushed to aid them from other western Libyan factions.",neutral
"Notre-Dame fire under control, Macron vows to rebuild","
PARIS (AFP) - A raging fire that tore through Notre-Dame Cathedral in central Paris was under control early Tuesday after the blaze brought its towering spire and roof crashing to the ground, wiping out centuries of priceless heritage central to French culture and history.
French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to rebuild the cathedral described as the soul of the nation and expressed relief that ""the worst had been avoided"" in a blaze that had at one point threatened the entire edifice.
Thousands of Parisians and tourists watched in horror from nearby streets cordoned off by the police as flames engulfed the building and officials tried to save as much as they could of the cathedral’s countless treasures, built up over centuries.
The inferno destroyed the roof of the 850-year-old UNESCO world heritage landmark, whose spectacular Gothic spire collapsed as orange flames and clouds of grey smoke billowed into the early evening sky.
Around 400 firefighters battled into the night to control the flames, declaring in the early hours of Tuesday that it was partially extinguished but completely under control, around nine hours after it broke out.
Paris fire brigade chief Jean-Claude Gallet said ""we can consider that the main structure of Notre-Dame has been saved and preserved"" as well as the two bell towers.
But ""the whole of the roof has been devastated... a part of the vault has collapsed, the spire is no more"", fire brigade spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gabriel Plus said.
Laurent Nunez, state secretary at the interior ministry, told reporters early Tuesday that with the immediate ""danger of the fire over,"" the focus would be on assessing the damage to the building’s structure.
Nunez said officials would meet shortly to see if the building was stable enough to allow fire services to go inside.

‘France is Notre Dame’ 


""Notre-Dame survived all the wars, all the bombardments. We never thought it could burn. I feel incredibly sad and empty,"" Stephane Seigneurie, a consultant who joined other shocked onlookers in a solemn rendition of ""Ave Maria"" as they watched the fire from a nearby bridge.
Gasps and cries of ""Oh my god"" erupted around an hour after the fire first broke out when the top portion of the church’s spire came crashing down.
""We have been dealt a knockout blow,"" a stricken-looking Paris Archbishop Michel Aupetit told reporters.
The cause of the blaze was not immediately clear, but the cathedral had been undergoing intense restoration work which the fire service said could be linked to the blaze.
French prosecutors said it was being currently being treated as an accident.
Historians expressed dismay at the collapse of a building that has been a symbol of France for almost a millennium.
""If Paris is the Eiffel Tower then France is Notre Dame. It’s the entire culture, entire history of France incarnated in this monument,"" Bernard Lecomte, a writer and specialist in religious history told BFM TV.
Deputy Paris mayor Emmanuel Gregoire told the channel that workers were scrambling ""to save all the artworks that can be saved.""
Officials later said teams had managed to salvage an unknown quantity of the cultural treasures.

‘Emotion of a nation’ 


Macron cancelled a planned national policy speech on recent ""Yellow Vest"" protests and instead headed to the scene, where he vowed the cathedral would be reborn.
""We will rebuild Notre-Dame because it is what the French expect,"" he said, describing Notre Dame as ""the epicentre of our life"" and the cathedral of ""all the French"", whether religious or not.
France’s billionaire Pinault dynasty immediately pledged 100 million euros for the reconstruction effort.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Notre-Dame cathedral a ""symbol of European culture"" as the blaze raged.
The Vatican on Monday expressed its ""incredulity"" and ""sadness"" over the fire.

‘Water bombers not used’ 


One firefighter was injured in the blaze, the fire brigade said, revising an earlier assessment that the individual was in a serious condition.
US President Donald Trump in a tweet said it was ""horrible"" to watch the fire but caused controversy by offering advice on how to put it out.
""Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!"" he said.
But France’s civil security service, which oversees crisis management in the country, tweeted back at Trump that the use of water-bombing aircraft was not being considered.
""If used, (this) could lead to the collapse of the entire structure of the cathedral,"" it said.

‘Will never be the same’ 


The cathedral is located at the very centre of the French capital and its construction was completed in the mid-12th century after some 200 years of work.
During the French Revolution in the 18th century, the cathedral was vandalised in widespread anti-clerical violence: its spire was dismantled, its treasures plundered and its large statues at the grand entrance doors destroyed.
It would go on to feature as a central character in a Victor Hugo novel published in 1831, ""The Hunchback of Notre-Dame"" and shortly afterwards a restoration project lasting two decades got under way, led by architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc.
The building survived the devastation of two global conflicts in the 20th century and famously rang its bells on August 24, 1944, the day of the Liberation of Paris from German occupation at the end of the World War II.
""Paris is disfigured. The city will never be like it was before,"" said Philippe, a communications worker in his mid-30s.

Yemen parties agree details of pullback plan: UN envoy,"
UNITED NATIONS (AFP) - Yemen s government and Huthi rebels have accepted a detailed plan for a much-delayed pullback from the flashpoint city of Hodeida, the UN envoy said Monday, but no timetable was announced for the withdrawals.
The redeployment of forces was agreed in December under a ceasefire deal reached in Sweden that offered the best hope in years of moving toward an end to the war that has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.
UN envoy Martin Griffiths told the Security Council that ""both parties have now accepted a detailed redeployment plan"" for the first stage of the pullback from Hodeida.
Griffiths said he received assurances from Huthi leader Abdul Malik al Huthi when they met in Sanaa last week that his forces would support the Hodeida agreement, but the envoy sounded a note of caution after so many delays.
""Let us be clear that when -- and I hope it is when and not if -- these redeployments happen, they will be the first voluntary withdrawal of forces in this long conflict,"" he said by videoconference from Amman.
The United Nations announced a deal on the two-stage pullback from Hodeida city and its ports in February, but the redeployment failed to materialize on the ground and the peace effort has since stalled.
The United States put the onus on the Huthis to unblock the process and begin redeployments as agreed in the plan.
""The Yemeni government has demonstarted a clear commitment to the United Nations led process,"" acting US Ambassador Jonathan Cohen told the Security Council.
""It is time for the Huthis to also show the international community that they too are serious about the UN process and the agreements that they themselves reached in Stockholm,"" he said.
The United States, which has supported the Saudi-led coalition backing the government in Yemen s war, also accused the Huthis of blocking access to a food storage site that contains enough grain to feed 3.7 million people for a month.
The Red Sea Mills ""remain closed and the food stocks within may be rotten,"" said Cohen.  ""At this point only the Huthis are blocking access to the Mills and they alone will be to blame if the food spoils.""
The Red Sea port of Hodeida is the entry point for the bulk of imported goods and relief aid to Yemen.
The detailed plan on the pullback was negotiated by Danish General Michael Lollesgaard who heads a UN monitoring mission.
Following the deal on the first stage, Lollesgaard will now focus on the second phase and seek to resolve disputes over the deployment of local forces in areas from where there has been a pullback.
Griffiths said he was laying the groundwork for broader serious negotiations on ending the war in Yemen but added: ""We all need to see tangible progress in Hodeida before moving to focus on the political solution.""
The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 to push back an advance by Huthi rebels who continue to hold the capital Sanaa, and restore Hadi to power.
The conflict has unleashed the world s worst humanitarian conflict, according to the United Nations, with millions facing famine.

Nearly 150 killed in battle for Libya's Tripoli: WHO,"
TRIPOLI (AFP) - At least 147 people have been killed and 614 wounded in the offensive launched on April 4 by Libyan military strongman Khalifa Haftar to take the capital Tripoli, the World Health Organization said Monday.
The clashes have displaced more than 18,000 people, according to the latest figures from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Fighting broke out as Haftar s forces sought to take control of Tripoli from loyalists of the internationally-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) which is based in the capital.
The rising number of casualties has prompted the World Health Organization to deploy surgical teams ""to support Tripoli-area hospitals as they cope with the influx of trauma cases"", the UN agency wrote on Twitter.
At least eight ambulances have been hit during clashes in the southern outskirts of the capital, as both sides have defied international calls to halt the fighting.
WHO urged ""all parties to exercise restraint and avoid causing collateral damage to hospitals, ambulances and health workers"".
In addition to ground fighting, both pro-government forces and Haftar s self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) carry out daily air raids and accuse each other of targeting civilians.
The resulting casualties have left health facilities in ""critical need of assistance"", according to the United Nations refugee agency.
""The situation on the ground continues deteriorating and number of casualties soaring,"" UNHCR tweeted.

UN condemns Taliban's spring offensive in Afghanistan,"
UNITED NATIONS (AFP) - The United Nations Security Council condemned Afghanistan s Taliban on Monday for announcing a spring offensive and called on all parties to instead seize the opportunity to begin talks.
In a unanimous statement, the council said the Taliban s announcement will ""only result in more unnecessary suffering and destruction for the Afghan people.""
The Taliban launched attacks near the northern city of Kunduz and in Kabul on Saturday, hours after announcing the start of the spring offensive.
At least nine people were killed and scores wounded in those attacks, according to Afghan officials.
The bloodshed came as the US pushes for a peace settlement with the Taliban, and ahead of a new round of talks expected to take place in Qatar later this month.
The Security Council ""called on all parties to the conflict to seize the opportunity to begin an inclusive intra-Afghan dialogue and negotiations that result in a political settlement,"" said the statement.
US officials have already met several times with the Taliban and further talks are expected in the Qatari capital Doha later this month that would include Afghan political leaders.
Zalmay Khalilzad, the US diplomat who has held several rounds of talks with the Taliban in hopes of reaching a peace deal, called the announcement of the spring offensive ""reckless"" and ""irresponsible.""
To facilitate travel to Doha, the council has lifted travel bans for 11 Taliban delegates, including Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a cofounder of the Islamist movement and its top political leader, as well as Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, the Taliban s former deputy minister of foreign affairs.

Macron vows to rebuild Notre-Dame after devastating fire,"
PARIS (AFP) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday vowed to rebuild Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, after a colossal fire caused the spire of the historic edifice to crash to the ground and wiped out centuries of heritage.
Macron expressed relief that ""the worst had been avoided"" in a fire that risked bringing the entire edifice down and left France in shock over the damage to a building described as the soul of the nation.
But the blaze destroyed the roof of the 850-year-old UNESCO world heritage landmark, whose spectacular Gothic spire collapsed before the eyes of horrified onlookers on a previously pristine early spring evening.
The fire, which came as Catholics prepare to celebrate Easter, sent orange flames and clouds of grey smoke billowing into the sky as stunned Parisians and tourists watched on in horror.
As darkness fell, some 400 firefighters then battled to control the blaze and save at least its iconic front towers. They finally gained the upper hand as midnight approached.
Paris fire brigade chief Jean-Claude Gallet said ""we can consider that the main structure of Notre-Dame has been saved and preserved"" as well as the two towers.
Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez, also present at the scene, said that for the first time ""the fire had decreased in intensity"" while still urging ""extreme caution"".

The cause of the blaze was not immediately confirmed. The cathedral had been undergoing intense restoration work which the fire service said could be linked to the blaze.
French prosecutors said it was being treated as an ""involuntary"" fire, indicating that foul play was ruled out for now.
Historians expressed incredulity at the collapse of a building that has been a symbol of France for almost a millennium and withstood war and revolution.

Visibly emotional, he said while the ""worst had been avoided"" and the facade and two towers saved ""the next hours will be difficult"".

Paris stunned as fire ravages Notre-Dame cathedral,"
PARIS (AFP) - A colossal fire swept through the famed Notre-Dame Cathedral in central Paris on Monday, causing a spire to collapse and threatening to destroy the entire masterpiece and its precious artworks.

Taliban team at Afghan peace talks in Qatar to include women: spokesman,"
KABUL (Reuters) - Women will be included for the first time in the Taliban delegation to talks this month with U.S. officials and Afghan representatives in Qatar over the future of Afghanistan, the movement’s main spokesman said on Monday.
For a group notorious for its strictly conservative attitude to women’s rights, the move represents a step towards addressing demands that women be included in the talks, aimed at bringing an end to more than 17 years of war in Afghanistan.
“There will be women among Taliban delegation members in the Doha, Qatar meeting,” Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban’s main spokesman, said by telephone.
He did not name the women, but added, “These women have no family relationship with the senior members of the Taliban, they are normal Afghans, from inside and outside the country, who have been supporters and part of the struggle of the Islamic Emirate”.
The April 19-21 meeting in Doha will be the latest in a series of talks between Taliban and U.S. officials and is also expected to include a 150-strong delegation of Afghan politicians and civil society figures.
The Taliban have maintained their rejection of formal talks with the Afghan government, which they dismiss as a “puppet” regime controlled by the United States.
While Afghanistan remains a deeply conservative country, especially in rural areas, there have been major advances in women’s rights since the U.S-led campaign of 2001 that toppled the Taliban government. Many women fear that if the group regains some power, many of these gains could be erased.
The movement gained worldwide notoriety when it came to power in the 1990s by forcing women to wear full facial covering and imposing severe restrictions including banning girls from school and forbidding women from working outside the home.
However Taliban spokesmen say the group has changed and it encourages girls’ education and other women’s rights within an Islamic Sharia system.
Civil society groups, the Western-backed government and Afghanistan’s international partners have pressed for women to take part in the talks and news of the Taliban delegation was welcomed. Fawzia Koofi, a former member of parliament who took part in a previous round of meetings in Moscow, said the presence of women in the Taliban team was a “good step”.
“Only women can feel the pain and miseries that Afghan women have suffered. The presence of women among the Taliban negotiators shows that the Taliban’s ideology has changed.”
Jean Shaheen, a member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, who has been pressing for women to play a role in the peace talks, said such inclusion would be vital for future international support for Afghanistan.
“There are certain levers that we have, that the Taliban are interested in,” she told reporters in Kabul, where she was visiting as part of a Congressional delegation. “There is going to be an interest in economic support after the conflict ends.”
“I think if the Taliban has any interest in getting international support ... it would be in their interest to recognize the importance of including women and including human rights as part of any settlement that happens.”

US terror label for Iran Revolutionary Guard takes effect,"
WASHINGTON (AP) — The US terrorism label for Iran s Revolutionary Guard formally took effect on Monday, amid a battle between the Trump administration and some in Congress over waivers on oil and nuclear sanctions that are due to expire or be extended early next month.
The Guard s formal designation as a ""foreign terrorist organization"" — the first-ever for an entire division of another government — kicked in with a notice published in the Federal Register.
The move adds a layer of sanctions to the elite military unit and makes it a crime for anyone in or subject to US jurisdiction to provide it with material support. Depending on how broadly ""material support"" is interpreted, the designation may complicate U.S. diplomatic and military cooperation with certain third-country officials, notably in Iraq and Lebanon, who deal with the Guard.
President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the step with great fanfare last week, opening a one-week consultation period with Congress during which members could have raised objections.
Lawmakers were broadly supportive, but congressional Iran hawks are now expressing concern that the administration may extend waivers on oil and nuclear sanctions. Those sanctions, which are unrelated to the Guard designation, were imposed last November following Trump s withdrawal of the U.S. from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal that May.
They target major elements of Iran s economy, notably its energy sector, by hitting foreign companies and governments with so-called ""secondary sanctions"" if they continue to do business with targeted Iranian entities. A main goal has been to dry up revenue from Iran s oil exports, which the U.S. says is the main driver of the country s funding of destabilizing activities throughout the Middle East and beyond.
In order not to shock oil markets with the sudden loss of Iranian crude, the administration granted several waivers that allowed some nations and Taiwan to continue their imports as long as they moved to reduce them to zero. Those waivers are due to expire in early May, and Iran hawks in Congress and elsewhere are urging the administration not to renew any of them. They say extending even some of the eight waivers would run counter to Trump and Pompeo s stated goal of keeping ""maximum pressure"" on Iran.
U.S. officials have been coy when asked about the waivers, leading to concern among hawks that some or all of them may be extended.
The administration s point man for Iran, Brian Hook, has said that three of the waivers won t need to be extended as those countries have eliminated all Iranian oil imports. But he has remained silent on the other five. Pompeo has similarly refused to comment on the possibility of extensions.
In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week, Pompeo was pressed by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, about whether the oil sanctions waivers, as well as waivers related to technical cooperation at Iranian nuclear facilities, would be extended. He suggested that some at the State Department were pushing for extensions.
""Let me urge you and urge the department unequivocally not to grant the nuclear waivers and not to grant the oil waivers,"" Cruz said, ""I think maximum pressure should mean maximum pressure.""
Pompeo demurred, but during a trip to South America over the weekend he bristled when asked if the Iran hawks had reason to be concerned.
""It s ludicrous,"" he told reporters accompanying him. ""It s ludicrous. Look, people want to tell stories, people want to sell newspapers. I ve got it. Congressmen will grandstand, I ve got that too. The State Department s going to get it right. We understand our mission.""
Cruz was not impressed. ""The Senate Foreign Relations Committee needs to understand why some in the State Department think it s a good idea to keep enriching the Ayatollah with oil billions and to let Iran keep spinning centrifuges in a bunker that they dug into the side of a mountain so they could build nuclear weapons,"" he said in a statement released by his office.

Turkey says buying Russian defence system should not trigger US sanctions,"
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Turkey s purchase of Russian air defence missile systems should not trigger US sanctions because Ankara is not an adversary of Washington and remains committed to the NATO alliance, Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said on Monday.
Akar also said that Turkey expected to remain not just a buyer of F-35 stealth fighter jets but also a partner in its production, despite US warnings that it would be shut out of the F-35 project if it buys the Russian S-400 defence system.
""We firmly believe that linking the S-400 to the F-35 project is unfortunate,"" he told a conference in Washington. ""We expect the United States and other project partners to honour their commitments"".
The United States says it will not allow F-35s to operate alongside the Russian defence system. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that Washington had told Ankara it could face retribution for buying the S-400s under a sanctions law known as CAATSA.
Akar repeated Turkey s offer to hold technical talks with the United States to address ""technical concerns"" over the S-400 purchase.
Turkey is also assessing a renewed offer from the United States to buy Patriot missile defence systems, Akar added. ""Recently we received the restated offer for the Patriots. This offer is now on the table, we are studying it carefully.""

New Zealand PM Ardern's approval rating rises to highest since taking office,"
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who was praised at home and abroad for her handling of the Christchurch mosques shooting last month, received her highest approval rating since taking office in a widely watched poll on Monday.

The 1 NEWS Colmar Brunton political survey showed 51 percent of respondents said Ardern was their preferred prime minister, climbing seven percentage points from the last poll in February.

Its the first political survey since a lone gunman killed 50 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch on March 15.

Ratings for Ardern’s rival, opposition National Party leader Simon Bridges, dropped one percentage point to five percent.

Party vote results also showed Ardern’s Labour Party rising three percentage points to 48 percent while the National’s rating dropping to its lowest since September 2017, at 40 percent.

“All I know is that I’m doing my job to the best of my ability,” Ardern told 1News when asked about the poll result.

Since coming to power in 2017, Ardern’s coalition government has faced several challenges including weak business confidence, emboldened unions and a slowing economy. Her youth and global celebrity has also given critics doubt.
But the 38-year-old leader struck all the right notes in the hours after the Christchurch attack.

Ardern promptly labeled the mass killing as terrorism, and set about reassuring a nation that has been largely unscathed by the violence and fears that have afflicted other countries in the past two decades.

Picture of Ardern’s wearing a head scarf and comforting families affected by the massacre went viral on the social media, and garnered praises from Muslims around the world, as well as leaders of other nations.

She also successfully passed a contentious gun law within a month of the shooting, which banned semi-autmatic weapons.

Ardern burst into prominence after her coalition ended 10 years of National Party’s center right rule, promising more money for social services and by vowing to tighten foreign investment rules.

She rocketed to global celebrity as an inspiration for women after the unexpected election win, and she became only the second leader to give birth while in office since Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto.

The poll was taken from April 6 to April 10, and has a margin of error of 3.1 percent, the polling agency said. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-15-19/news_big_images/487057_90603750.jpg,world,"

Red Cross seeks news on fate of three staff missing in Syria since 2013,"
GENEVA/WELLINGTON (Reuters) - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has appealed for information on the fate of three employees abducted in Syria more than five years ago and last known to have been held by Islamic State.

Breaking its silence on the case on Sunday, the independent aid agency identified the three as Louisa Akavi, a nurse from New Zealand, and Syrian drivers Alaa Rajab and Nabil Bakdounes.

“Our latest credible information indicates that Louisa was alive in late 2018,” it said.

U.S.-backed forces proclaimed the capture of Islamic State’s last territory in Syria last month, eliminating its rule over a caliphate it had proclaimed in Iraq and Syria in 2014.

ICRC President Peter Maurer raised her case during a visit to the camp, run by Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in March, they added.

“We call on anyone with information to please come forward. If our colleagues are still being held, we call for their immediate and unconditional release,” the ICRC said in a statement providing a Syrian contact number: +963 953 555 745.
It said it had not been able to learn more details about the two drivers, and their fate was not known.

The three were traveling in a Red Cross convoy in October 2013, delivering supplies to medical facilities in Idlib, northwestern Syria, when it was stopped by armed men. Four other people abducted with them were released the next day.

The Swiss-run agency has a policy of never paying ransoms.

Akavi, now 62, joined the ICRC in 1988 and has worked in a number of hotspots.

She has been held longer than anyone in ICRC’s 156-year history, said Dominik Stillhart, ICRC director of operations worldwide.

New Zealand’s government said it was searching for Akavi. Foreign Minister Winston Peters said the government had deployed a non-combat team based in Iraq that included special operations personnel, “focused on locating ...and identifying opportunities to recover her.”

After being moved by IS forces to Raqqa in 2017, Akavi was seen in Al-Bukamal in late 2018, close to the Syrian-Iraqi border, the last concrete information on her whereabouts, Stillhart said.

“What we actually know is that Louisa has been working as a nurse during her abduction which shows her dedication and commitment,” he said. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-15-19/news_big_images/487056_83792270.jpg,world,"

Israel's president starts consultations on prime minister nomination,"
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s president began post-election consultations on Monday with political parties that will lead to his appointment of a candidate to form a government.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s nomination seemed virtually ensured after his right-wing Likud won the largest number of parliamentary seats in Tuesday’s ballot, and his closest rival, Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party, conceded defeat.

The president, Reuven Rivlin, said he would announce his choice on Wednesday after meeting with all of the parties that captured seats in the 120-member Knesset.

Under Israeli law, after consultations with the parties the president taps a legislator whom he believes has the best chance of forming a government, delegating 28 days, with a two-week extension if necessary, to complete the task.

Netanyahu said he intends to build a coalition with five far-right, right-wing and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties that would give a Likud-led government 65 seats, four more than the outgoing administration he heads.

Four of those parties have already said they would back Netanyahu, bringing his tally of seats to 60.

Former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman of the ultranationalist Yisrael Beitenu party, which won five seats and meets Rivlin on Tuesday, has not formally declared he would join a Likud-led coalition.

But political commentators, noting Lieberman’s sharp differences with left-wing and Arab parties whose support Gantz would need to govern, predicted he would sign up with Netanyahu after pressing for concessions in coalition negotiations.

Gantz, a former military chief whose party won 35 parliamentary seats, would likely be next in line to try to put together a government if Netanyahu fails.

For the first time, Rivlin’s consultations with the parties were being broadcast live as part of what he described as a display of transparency in what has historically been a closed-door process in Israel.

At the meeting with Likud representatives, Culture Minister Miri Regev noted Netanyahu had won re-election despite Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit’s announcement in February that he plans to charge the prime minister in three graft cases.

Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing. He can still argue, at a pre-trial hearing with Mandelblit whose date has not been set, against the filing of bribery and fraud charges against him.

By the numbers: Indonesia's national elections,"
JAKARTA (AFP) - More than 190 million Indonesians are set to cast their ballots Wednesday in one of the world’s biggest one-day elections.
Voters in the Muslim-majority country will choose a new president, hundreds of parliamentarians and thousands more local officials at over 800,000 polling stations across the Southeast Asian archipelago.
Here are some key facts and figures about the April 17 polls in the third-biggest democracy behind India and the United States:

192 million 


The number of Indonesians, including some two million living overseas, who are eligible to vote out of a population of more than 260 million.

16 

The number of parties contesting the 575 seats in the House of Representatives, Indonesia’s lower house of parliament.
Opinion polls have put incumbent president Joko Widodo well ahead of his sole challenger, ex-general Prabowo Subianto, in a re-run of the pair’s 2014 race, which Widodo narrowly won.

245,000 


The number of candidates competing for nearly 24,000 seats in legislatures at the provincial and district level across the world’s biggest archipelago nation.

8 hours 


The complex vote will happen over about eight hours, with voting to kick off at 7:00 am local time (2200 GMT Tuesday) in easternmost Papua and ending at 1:00 pm in Indonesia’s westernmost time zone, which includes the capital Jakarta.

4,800 kilometres 


This is the first time that Indonesia is holding presidential, parliamentary and local elections on the same day. That presents a huge logistical challenge in a vast country that stretches some 4,800 kilometres (3,000 miles) from the tip of Sumatra island across Java and beach paradise Bali to remote islands in the eastern edges of its territory.

805,068 


The number of polling booths staffed by more than six million election workers. Elections officials use every means possible to get ballot boxes to voters in mountain-top villages, deep in the jungle and on remote islands. They transport them by jeep, boat, on horseback and even by foot.
Voters make their choice by piercing a hole in the ballot paper next to a candidate’s name. Then they dip their finger in indelible ink to make sure no one votes more than once.
A series of ""quick counts"" are released by pollsters hours after voting. These unofficial tallies have in the past accurately predicted the final results, which are expected in May.

453,000 

The number of police and soldiers, plus 1.6 million civil protection force members, that will be deployed to safeguard the election -- or about two million people in all.  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-15-19/news_big_images/487033_94428730.jpg,world,"

UN envoy holds 'substantial' talks with Syria FM in Damascus,"
DAMASCUS (AFP) - The UN envoy for Syria held ""substantial"" talks Sunday in Damascus with Foreign Minister Walid Muallem on efforts to find a political settlement to the country s eight-year-long war.
""We have had very detailed substantial discussions,"" Norwegian diplomat Geir Pedersen told reporters after the meeting.
""We are now addressing all the issues so all the issues are at the table,"" he said, without specifying.
The envoy said he was set to hold more talks with Syrian officials later in the day.
""Let s see how we are able to proceed later this afternoon,"" he added.
State news agency SANA said Pedersen and Muallem discussed ongoing efforts to advance Syria s political process, including moves to form a committee tasked with drawing up a post-war constitution.
They also spoke about the envoy s diplomatic activities since his last visit to Damascus in March, SANA added.
Pedersen arrived in Damascus on Saturday, in his third official visit to the country since assuming his post in January.
He became the fourth UN negotiator aiming to resolve Syria s conflict following the resignation of his predecessor Staffan de Mistura.
Since early January, he has travelled extensively to meet with the government, opposition and others.
The UN Security Council remains deeply divided over the way forward in Syria.
Veto-wielding Russia, a key backer of President Bashar al-Assad, has taken a lead role in diplomatic efforts through the so-called Astana group with Iran and Turkey that has largely sidelined UN diplomacy.
Syria s war has killed more than 370,000 people and displaced millions since the conflict began with the repression of anti-government protests in 2011.
The regime has made a military comeback with Russian military support since 2015, and now holds almost two-thirds of the country.

Egypt's Sisi meets Libyan strongman Haftar in Cairo: presidency,"
CAIRO (AFP) - Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi met Sunday with Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar, whose forces are fighting for control of the capital Tripoli, the presidency said.
""The president (Sisi) affirmed Egypt s support in efforts to fight terrorism and extremist militias to achieve security and stability for Libyan citizens throughout the country"", it said in a statement.
Their discussion comes on the back of ""the latest developments on the Libyan situation"", it added.
Sisi has been an ardent supporter of Haftar s forces, which control swathes of eastern Libya and launched an offensive on April 4 to take the capital.
Fighting near Tripoli has killed 121 people and wounded 561, the World Health Organization said on Sunday.
Haftar has defied international calls to halt his battle against fighters loyal to the UN-backed Government of National Accord based in Tripoli.
The military strongman supports a parallel administration based in the Libya s east.
Earlier this month, Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry cautioned that the conflict could not be solved militarily.
His remarks came at a Cairo press conference with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, who also called for a political solution among all sides in Libya.
The Libyan commander has modelled his political style of authoritarian leadership after Sisi, himself an army general turned president.
Egypt has provided funding and arms to Haftar s self-styled Libyan National Army, seeing him as a bulwark against Islamist militants.
Haftar, who was exiled in the United States for two decades, returned to Libya in 2011 when the revolution erupted, commanding forces that eventually toppled dictator Moamer Kadhafi.
The oil-rich north African country has been in turmoil ever since with successive weak governments in place and several Islamist militias battling for territorial control.

Sudan protesters demand 'immediate' civilian rule,"
KHARTOUM (AFP) - Sudanese protesters on Sunday demanded the country s military rulers ""immediately"" hand power over to a civilian government that should then bring ousted leader Omar al-Bashir to justice.
Thousands remained encamped outside Khartoum s army headquarters to keep up pressure on a military council that took power after ousting Bashir on Thursday.
The organisation that spearheaded the protests against Bashir, the Sudanese Professionals Association, called on the council ""to immediately transfer power to a civilian government"".
The SPA also demanded the next ""transitional government and the armed forces bring Bashir and all the chiefs of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS)... to justice"".
""The Sudanese Professionals Association calls on its supporters to continue with the sit-in until the revolution achieves its demands,"" it added.
The military council later held a press conference at which its spokesman did not respond to the protesters  latest demands. Instead it announced the appointment of a new intelligence chief.
Earlier the military council met with political parties and urged them to agree on an ""independent figure"" to be prime minister, an AFP correspondent present at the meeting said.
""We want to set up a civilian state based on freedom, justice and democracy,"" a council member, Lieutenant General Yasser al-Ata, told several political parties, urging them to agree on the figures to sit in civilian government.
The protesters have insisted civilian representatives must join the military council.
A 10-member delegation representing the protesters delivered their demands during talks with the council late Saturday, according to a statement by the Alliance for Freedom and Change umbrella group spearheading the rallies.
The foreign ministry urged the international community to back the military council ""to achieve the Sudanese goal of democratic transition"".
It said council chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan was ""committed to having a complete civilian government and the role of the council will be to maintain the sovereignty of the country"".
Talks between protest leaders and Sudan s new rulers were followed Sunday by a meeting between Washington s top envoy to Khartoum, Steven Koutsis, and the military council s deputy.
Mohammad Hamdan Daglo, widely known as Himeidti, told Koutsis ""about the measures taken by the military council to preserve the security and stability of the country,"" the official SUNA news agency reported.
Himeidti is a field commander for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) counter-insurgency unit, which rights groups have accused of abuses in the war-torn Darfur region.
On Saturday, the military council s new chief General Burhan vowed to dismantle Bashir s regime, lifting a night-time curfew with immediate effect.
He also pledged that individuals implicated in killing protesters would face justice and that protesters detained under a state of emergency imposed by Bashir during his final weeks in power would be freed.
Burhan took the oath of office on Friday after his predecessor General Awad Ibn Ouf stepped down little more than 24 hours after Bashir s ouster.
The United States, Britain and Norway said Sunday it was time for Sudan s military rulers and other parties to hold talks over the country s transition to civilian rule.
""This must be done credibly and swiftly, with protest leaders, political opposition, civil society organisations, and all relevant elements of society, including women,"" the embassies of the three countries said in a statement.
Tens of thousands of people have massed non-stop outside the army headquarters since April 6, initially to urge the military to back their demand that Bashir be removed.
Burhan comes with less baggage from Bashir s deeply unpopular rule than Ibn Ouf, a former defence minister and longtime close aide of the deposed president.
But while celebrating the fall of both men in quick succession, protesters remain cautious.
Protest leaders say their demands include restructuring the country s feared NISS agency, whose chief Salih Ghosh resigned on Saturday.
On Sunday night, the council announced the appointment of Lieutenant General Abu Baker Mustafa as the new head of NISS in a televised announcement in which it also announced the sacking of Khartoum s envoy to Washington.
The newly formed 10-member transitional council contains several faces from Bashir s regime.
On Saturday evening, the new military ruler named NISS deputy head Jalaluddin Sheikh to the council, with Himeidti as its deputy head.
""Himeidti was part of the crimes that happened previously, but at least now he is on the side of the people,"" said Mohamed, a protester outside the army headquarters who gave only his first name for security reasons.
The military council, meanwhile, said it had sacked Khartoum s top envoy to Washington Mohamed Atta.
Key regional power brokers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have voiced support for the transitional council.
Burhan s nomination ""reflects the ambitions of the brotherly people of Sudan for security, stability and development,"" UAE state news agency WAM said.
Saudi Arabia has promised an aid package, the Saudi Press Agency reported Saturday.
Sudan is part of a UAE and Saudi-led military coalition fighting Iran-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen.

White House denies Trump inciting violence against Muslim lawmaker,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - Donald Trump s spokeswoman Sarah Sanders defended the president Sunday against accusations that he was inciting violence toward a Muslim congresswoman after he tweeted a video of her spliced with footage of the 9/11 attacks.
The White House s decision to double down on Ilhan Omar came as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the country s most powerful Democrat, said she had spoken to authorities about her colleague s safety and urged Trump to delete the clip.
Omar has been at the center of an escalating row after a clip emerged of her characterizing the deadliest attack on US soil as ""some people did something.""
On Friday, Trump tweeted a video that juxtaposed the snippet, which Omar s fellow Democrats say was taken out of context, with images of the hijacked planes used in the attacks crashing into the Twin Towers that once dominated New York s skyline. Menacing music accompanies Omar s words.
The clip, which had been viewed more than 9.4 million times as of Sunday afternoon, ends with the words: ""SEPTEMBER 11 2001 WE REMEMBER.""
Prominent Democrats including Beto O Rourke, Kamala Harris and Omar s fellow first-time Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were quick to rush to Omar s defense, accusing the president and other Republicans of deliberately de-contextualizing her remarks and endangering her life.
Sanders, however, defended Trump, telling ABC television s ""This Week"" that ""the president is wishing no ill will and certainly not violence towards anyone.""
But, she added: ""It s absolutely abhorrent the comments she continues to make and has made and (Democrats) look the other way.
""I find her comments to be absolutely disgraceful and unbefitting of a member of Congress and I think that it s a good thing that the president is calling her out for those comments, and the big question is why aren t Democrats doing it as well.""
Pelosi took time out from an official trip to issue a strong statement urging Trump to take the clip down.
""Following the president s tweet, I spoke with the sergeant-at-arms to ensure that Capitol Police are conducting a security assessment to safeguard Congresswoman Omar, her family and her staff,"" she said.
""The president s words weigh a ton, and his hateful and inflammatory rhetoric creates real danger. President Trump must take down his disrespectful and dangerous video.""
Omar has mounted her own trenchant fight back, tweeting Saturday: ""No one person - no matter how corrupt, inept, or vicious - can threaten my unwavering love for America.
""I stand undeterred to continue fighting for equal opportunity in our pursuit of happiness for all Americans,"" she said.
The controversy arose after Omar delivered a 20-minute address to the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) shortly after the New Zealand mosque attacks in March.
""For far too long, we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it,"" she said.
""CAIR was founded after 9/11,"" she added, ""because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.""
The civil rights group was in fact founded in 1994 but grew significantly after 2001.
The speech did not initially receive significant attention until the snippet in question was highlighted weeks later by controversial Australian personality Mohammad Tawhidi who refers to himself as the ""Imam of Peace.""

"ADB releases annual report, financial results for 2018","
ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – The Asian Development Bank (ADB) released its Annual Report for 2018 on Tuesday. 
The report presents ADB’s important operational and organizational milestones over the past year, including key numbers and data of ADB operations, activities, and financial results.
It also focuses on the adoption of ADB’s new long-term corporate strategy, Strategy 2030, approved in July 2018, and highlights the strategic transition in progress across all aspects of ADB’s operations and organization.
The demand for ADB assistance continued to grow in 2018. New commitments included $21.6 billion in loans, grants, and investments from ADB’s own resources, exceeding the target of $19.71 billion and up 10% from 2017.
Private sector operations reached $3.14 billion, a 37% increase from 2017, which is 14.5% of ADB’s overall commitment. The result reflected ADB’s long-term strategy to increase support for private enterprise, especially in new markets and sectors, to create more high-quality jobs and to mobilize private financial resource for development.
ADB also successfully mobilized $14 billion in cofinancing from bilateral and multilateral agencies and other financing partners, including $7.17 billion in co-financing from ADB’s private sector operations. The increase in co-financing saw total new commitments reach $35.82 billion in 2018, a 13% increase over 2017, reflecting the importance of partnerships in addressing Asia and the Pacific’s continuously growing development needs.
Disbursements, a key indicator for successful project implementation, also improved, rising to $14.19 billion in 2018, an increase of 24% from 2017.
In his message to stakeholders in the report, ADB President Takehiko Nakao said that Strategy 2030 had energized ADB and positioned the Manila-based lender well to help countries in Asia and the Pacific cope with the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
“As our region continues to develop and transform, so too must ADB,” said Nakao. “Strategy 2030 provides us with a clear roadmap to meet the needs of our developing member countries (DMCs) and guide our operations for the next decade. We set out clear corporate targets to significantly increase operations, to build climate and disaster resilience, address gender equality, and mobilize long-term private financing.”
ADB continued to deliver on its climate commitments in 2018 with $3.6 billion in financing approved. ADB is on target to double its annual climate financing to $6 billion in approvals by 2020.
ADB also made significant progress in designing projects with a gender focus. In 2018, 47% of ADB’s support, on a three-year-average term, included elements that directly improved the lives of women and girls in the region.
The report also records ADB’s successful efforts to strengthen its role as a leading provider of development knowledge and expertise to DMCs seeking support to implement policies, programs, and projects that utilize international best practices and learnings.
Internally, ADB continued to implement initiatives to improve operational efficiency and business processes. The report describes key areas of reform that support Strategy 2030, including information technology reforms to modernize ADB’s systems and infrastructure.
In 2018, to complement its print and online editions, ADB produced a new format of the Annual Report that is optimized for smart devices and screens. The new format includes rich multimedia content and enables standard touchscreen features such as swipe, tap, and scrol.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-16-19/news_big_images/487317_35011526.jpg,business,"We set out clear corporate targets to significantly increase operations, to build climate and disaster resilience, address gender equality, and mobilize long-term private financing.”

"US, Japan kick off trade talks amid China deal optimism","
TOKYO (AFP) - As optimism grows that the United States and China are nearing a trade deal, Japan kicks off its own negotiations with Washington from Monday, hoping to resolve some of the issues ""very quickly.""
US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Japan’s Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi are set to embark on two days of talks in Washington.
In Tokyo last week, Motegi predicted the crunch talks would be ""candid"", with the first round on Monday about ""making a decision on which areas we will discuss, chiefly in the field of goods"".
""I will do my best to have thorough discussions so as to produce a good result in line with our national interest,"" said Motegi.
Self-styled dealmaker Donald Trump has been playing hardball with traditional US trading partners, using tariffs and threats in an effort to boost US exports and curb Washington’s longstanding trade deficit.
In May, Trump ordered his administration to investigate the possibility of imposing tariffs of up to 25 percent on foreign autos and auto parts, a prospect that alarmed the industry and could have serious repercussions for Japan and Europe.
The US president has frequently complained that Japan has an unfair advantage in bilateral trade and vowed to fix that.

‘Very quick agreement’

US Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said Thursday he was seeking a ""very quick agreement"" with Japan on tariff cuts for agricultural goods.
""I hope we can come to a very quick agreement with Japan over maybe some temporary ... provisions and hash out the many other issues that take longer in this area,"" Perdue told reporters in Washington, Kyodo News and the business daily Nikkei reported.
However, the US side is likely to run into opposition from Japan on this issue, Jiji Press reported, citing unnamed government sources.
""There’s no way for us to conclude an agricultural deal first,"" a senior Japanese official told Jiji.
If Japan does so, it may violate World Trade Organization rules related to free-trade agreements, the officials noted, according to the report.
Tokyo is expected to counter with demands that the United States scrap tariffs on Japanese industrial goods, if Washington urges an early opening of Japanese agricultural markets.
Tokyo aims to focus only on tariff matters, describing the talks as ""TAG"" or trade agreement on goods.
However, Washington trade officials have spelled out 22 specific negotiation areas also including non-tariff barriers in Japan’s auto market and currency.
US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Saturday any agreement will include a requirement to refrain from manipulating currencies to gain an advantage in international trade.
Golf buddies Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will have plenty of opportunities to talk trade in the coming months.
Abe is visiting the United States later this month and Trump is expected in Japan in May to pay his respects to the country’s new emperor who will take the throne on May 1.

IMF chief says Brexit delay averts 'terrible outcome',"
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The six-month delay of Britain’s exit from the European Union avoids the “terrible outcome” of a “no-deal” Brexit that would further pressure a slowing global economy but does nothing to lift uncertainty over the final outcome, the head of the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday.
Moreover, the just-struck arrangement would not resolve the issues between Britain and the EU, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said at a news conference during the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington.
Earlier on Thursday, EU leaders gave Britain another six months to sort out its departure from the 28-member bloc, but the reprieve offered no clarity on when, how, or even if Brexit will happen.
“At least the UK is not leaving on April 12 without a deal. It gives time for continued discussions between the various parties involved in the UK. It probably gives time for economic agents to better prepare for all options, particularly industrialists and workers, in order to try to secure their future,” Lagarde said.
“A no-deal Brexit would have been a terrible outcome.”
While knock-on effects of the Brexit saga are rippling around the world to one extent or another, the three years since the June 2016 referendum to leave the EU have weighed most heavily on Britain.
The uncertainty facing British businesses has gone “through the roof” due to Brexit, hurting investment and posing long-term challenges for economic productivity, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said at an event on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank meetings.
Despite an “incredibly tight” labor market, businesses have held off on investment since the referendum, he said.
Carney said that while the risk of a no-deal Brexit had been lowered, it remained to be seen how well the extra time is used.
“It provides a window of time for a political process, particularly in the UK, to forge a consensus within the House of Commons around the form of agreement. We will see how that time is used,” Carney said.

RISKS BEYOND BREXIT

Brexit is just one of a clutch of economic risks that prompted the IMF this week to cut its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3.3 percent, the lowest rate since 2016, with a slight rebound to 3.6 percent expected next year.
The IMF’s No. 2 official, David Lipton, said the institution was not projecting a global recession but the growth slowdown leaves the world in a delicate spot.
“We do have to worry about the possibility of recession,” he said during a discussion at the IMF.
Officials have repeatedly pointed to fraught trade relations as a major culprit behind the global slowdown.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he remained hopeful Japan’s export-reliant economy will soon emerge from a soft patch but added that ongoing U.S.-China trade talks loomed over the global outlook.
“Protectionism benefits neither the United States nor China,” Kuroda told reporters upon arriving for a meeting of Group of 20 finance leaders.
Trade tensions are the top concern among emerging market finance officials as well. In a communique from a meeting of the so-called Group of 24 developing market nations released on Thursday, officials said: “International trade has delivered enormous benefits globally and has been an important engine of growth among G24 countries.”
The group said it stood ready to cooperate in the effort to build “a modern, open, rules-based, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system.”
Weakness in global trade is making economies rely more on consumers, BoE’s Carney said. “Normally when expansions are reliant on the consumer, you start watching the clock, in terms of how much longer it will last.”
German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said the most important task for leaders was to eliminate the political risks hindering growth.
“It’s our job to create an environment of certainty so that companies and consumers can make investments,” Scholz told reporters during a stop in Iceland on the way to Washington.

VENEZUELA QUESTION

Lagarde also said IMF shareholders were still undecided on whether to recognize Venezuelan opposition chief Juan Guaido as the South American country’s leader, a step seen as required for the IMF and World Bank to provide aid.
President Nicolas Maduro’s socialist government has not requested any aid and Venezuela, which is mired in a deep economic crisis marked by widespread shortages of food and medicine, has shunned the IMF since 2004.
But the IMF is prepared to move quickly on a package once a decision on the leadership question has been made, Lagarde said. Her comments were echoed by David Malpass, the new president of the World Bank. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-12-19/news_big_images/486683_49922723.jpg,business,"

Pak woman cricketer Diana ruled out of South Africa tour,"
LAHORE (APP) – Seventeen-year-old pace bowler Fatima Sana has been included in Pakistan women team that will tour South Africa in place of pace bowler Diana Baig, who underwent a surgery on her injured left thumb on Tuesday.
Diana has been advised eight to ten weeks rest following the surgery at Karachi and she has been ruled out of Pakistan’s tour of South Africa that begins from Monday, 29 April. Diana got injured during a training session in Karachi on Monday, where the South Africa bound squad is preparing for the tour.
Chief selector Pakistan women team Urooj Mumtaz on Tuesday expressed her disappointment at Diana’s injury she added that the tour of South Africa provides a good opportunity for Fatima to prove her worth.
“It was unfortunate that Diana fractured her left thumb during practice yesterday. Thankfully the surgery was a success and I wish her a speedy recovery. Diana has been replaced by Fatima Sana, a young promising fast bowler and I wish her all the best,” she said.
Fatima took seven wickets in as many games in the recently concluded 2nd Inter-Departmental T20 Women’s Cricket Championship 2019 that was held in Islamabad.
Hyderabad-born Fatima represented ZTBL in the tournament. Diana will now undergo a rehabilitation programme under the supervision of National Cricket Academy’s medical panel.

'Mix and match' - Australia to rotate openers after Warner return,"
SYDNEY (AFP) – Australian coach Justin Langer on Tuesday welcomed the top-order selection dilemma posed by the return of David Warner as offering ""fantastic flexibility"" to the team ahead of the World Cup.
The return of Steve Smith and Warner from their year-long bans for ball-tampering has left selectors in a quandary, with openers Aaron Finch and Usman Khawaja building a formidable partnership in recent one-day internationals.
Warner has been in blistering touch in the Indian Premier League and typically opens the batting.
But Langer on Tuesday said it was a welcome problem to have all three potential openers firing.
""We have amazing flexibility now,"" he told Melbourne radio SEN.
""Usman and Finchy have done an incredible job opening the batting. David and Finchy have done a great job in the past doing it,"" he added.
Langer said he would ""mix and match"" the top order in matches leading up to the World Cup.
""I love the flexibility of it. (It’s about) boys playing their roles for the team not just playing the roles that suit them,"" he said.
Australia named their World Cup squad on Monday with middle order batsman Peter Handscomb ""brutally unlucky"" to have to make way for Smith.
""Steve Smith we felt would probably be able to play that role that Pete has done so well for us,"" Langer said.
The decision to drop Handscomb also means the team only has one wicketkeeper in Alex Carey.
But Langer said Tim Paine, Matthew Wade and Handscomb, all named in one of Australia’s two A squads which will play in England later this year, were on standby if Carey was injured.
""Usually wicketkeepers, they give up their spot for no-one. They have to do a pretty serious injury to move aside for someone else,"" he said.
""And Alex Carey he is elite-fit and is as tough as they come. But if something does happen then we will have someone there to replace them."" ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-16-19/news_big_images/487225_49555424.jpg,Cricket,"""Steve Smith we felt would probably be able to play that role that Pete has done so well for us,"" Langer said.",neutral
Ex-cricketer Lewis on long walk back from disgrace to redemption,"
BASINGSTOKE (AFP) - Chris Lewis s journey from opening the bowling for England in the 1992 World Cup final to contemplating suicide and being convicted of drugs smuggling has him feeling as ambitious as when he was a teenager, he has told AFP.
The 51-year-old -- who represented England over 80 times in Tests and one-day internationals -- said it was fear over being penniless that drove him to smuggle 140,000 pound ($183,000) of cocaine in cans of fruit into England from St Lucia in 2008.
He stood to earn 50,000 pound from the deal -- instead he ended up serving six and a half years of a 13-year prison term.
The engaging and lithe former all-rounder is presently touring with the play written by Dougie Blaxland (the pen name of former cricketer James Graham-Brown) about his life called ""A Long Walk Back"".
""Do you know, the funny thing is I would suggest I am more ambitious and more optimistic than I have ever been in my life,"" Lewis told AFP in an interview conducted at the Haymarket Theatre in Basingstoke.
""This is a stage of my life I should have gone through in my 20s with a whole set of new experiences.
""It is a place I have not been since I was a teenager... a place when that teenage boy was dreaming of being a cricketer.""
The play, directed by Australian husband and wife Shane Morgan and Moira Hunt of the Bristol-based Roughhouse Theatre, has helped re-light the fire within him.
""It (the play) all comes together from an idea of how we have reached here when less than a decade ago I was sat in a prison cell and my life was more than over,"" Lewis said.
It is a far cry from when Lewis, whose long-term girlfriend Patricia stayed loyal despite him putting her  through the wars , contemplated taking his own life on the first night he was incarcerated after his arrest.
""You cannot get over the prospect of facing a sentence of 15 years,"" he said. ""If you have not been in jail it seems an unimaginable amount of time.
""The question of  if this goes the wrong way what will you do  and (suicide) was certainly something on the table.
""It is ironic that after being sentenced to 13 years that did not occur to me.""
Lewis, whose morale was greatly helped by former Surrey team-mate Jason Ratcliffe who offered him help from the start, largely kept himself to himself in prison.
""A strange thing that happened was sitting on my bed the night after the sentence had been passed and I cried and it got a lot of emotions out,"" he said.
""After I had done crying that night I had no need to cry again.
""In terms of the cell... let us say if you like the fragrance of someone else - the toilet is right next to the bed - there are some people who may put up with that because they want company.
""I was more the other way I wanted to be on my own having some control of one s environment and keep your room a certain way.""
There were certain rules that Lewis imposed on himself from the start of his jail term -- neither listening to music nor telling his adored grandmother Eunice Joseph back in Guyana about his fall from grace.
""I stopped listening to music immediately because a certain tune can take you back to a particular moment,"" he said.
""My mum (Patricia) and aunts took the decision not to tell my grandmother who was very proud of me and I wholeheartedly agreed with it.
""I would ring her from prison and ensured every Christmas that one of my brothers would send her money from me so she would think everything was normal.
""Sadly she was pretty sick at the time, bedridden, and died while I was inside,"" he says, his voice choking with emotion.
In the play, Lewis takes part in a question and answer session with the audience, fielding sometimes awkward enquiries.
He says he is pleased by the play -- which has included two prisons on its tour -- because it explores the emotional side of his story and the battle he had to accept who was to blame for his predicament.
""It was not immediate but eventually I came to the conclusion the person who has the final say in stuff that happened in your life is me.
""It is hard then to start to point the finger without pointing it backwards.""

Poor form puts Amla's World Cup place in jeopardy,"
JOHANNESBURG (AFP) - South Africa s selectors will reveal on Thursday whether veteran batsman Hashim Amla will be part of the country s squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.
Amla, 36, is one of South Africa s all-time great one-day international players but his recent form has been poor, while increasing age has meant that he has slowed down in the field.
Amla scored only 51 runs in four innings in South Africa s shock Test series loss against Sri Lanka earlier this year and did not play in the first three one-day internationals against the tourists, although Cricket South Africa stressed he had not been dropped.
He was due to play the final two one-day games against Sri Lanka but withdrew because his father was seriously ill.
After more than a month out of cricket, Amla returned for the Cape Cobras franchise in a domestic Twenty20 competition in early April but his first three matches yielded only 28 runs.
He showed signs of promise for the Cobras on Sunday with an innings of 32 -- his joint-highest score in any form of cricket since a one-day series against Pakistan in January.
With captain Faf du Plessis, Quinton de Kock, Rassie van der Dussen, David Miller and JP Duminy all seemingly certain of selection, there is probably room for only two more top-order batsmen in a 15-man squad.
Amla s rivals, Aiden Markram and Reeza Hendricks, have both been in good recent form, with Hendricks named man-of-the-series in the recent Twenty20 series against Sri Lanka after a poor one-day series had seemingly scuttled his chances.
Markram and Hendricks are outstanding fielders.
The other big debate ahead of the squad announcement is the identity of a back-up fast bowler to the likely trio of Kagiso Rabada, Dale Steyn and Lungi Ngidi.
Newcomer Anrich Nortje was impressive in the one-day series against Sri Lanka and although he was forced to withdraw from the Indian Premier League with a shoulder injury he is expected to be fit for the World Cup.
While he has not played in a one-day international since February last year, Chris Morris has been picked by several experts in their preferred World Cup squads because he can bowl at more than 140 kph and is a hard-hitting lower-order batsman.
Three wickets for the Delhi Capitals against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Sunday took his total to 11 in six matches in this year s IPL.
Andile Phehlukwayo and Dwaine Pretorius are likely to be picked as all-rounders, while Imran Tahir and Tabraiz Shamsi are South Africa s probable spin bowlers.
It is unlikely that a back-up wicketkeeper to De Kock will be chosen, with Miller seemingly being groomed as an emergency gloveman.

Bangladesh hit by injuries ahead of World Cup,"
DHAKA (AFP) - Bangladesh s hopes for the cricket World Cup have been hit by injuries to several key players, including star pace bowler Mustafizur Rahman.
The 23-year-old left arm bowler sprained his ankle warming up for a Dhaka Premier League match on Thursday, joining a growing injury list which includes batsman Mahmudullah Riyad and pace bowler Rubel Hossain.
Bangladesh had previously barred the injury-prone Mustafizur from playing in the Indian Premier League ahead of the World Cup, which starts May 30. It had let him take part in the domestic 50-over league to keep match-fit however.
The new injury is expected to sideline him for at least two weeks.
""Mustafizur is slightly better now. We are hopeful he will play the World Cup,"" Bangladesh Cricket Board chief physician Debashis Chowdhury told AFP.
Debashis is being kept busy by the squad.
Mahmudullah aggravated a shoulder injury during a recent tour of New Zealand and only returned to tentative training last week.
Rubel Hossain has been suffering from a side strain.
""We hope to start his training session within a day or two,"" said Debashis.
Wicketkeeper-batsman Mushfiqur Rahim, who missed the two Tests in New Zealand started individual training last week while batsman Tamim Iqbal was expected to resume in the upcoming days.
Pace bowler Taskin Ahmed, who was in superb form before a ligament injury ruled out him of the New Zealand tour, played one domestic league game last week.
Off-spinner Mehidy Hasan hurt his thumb in a league game last week but returned to action on Monday.
However, Debashis was hopeful all of the squad would be match-fit for the tournament.
""With the amount of time we have and the current improvement rate of the players, I don t think any one will miss the World Cup,"" he said.
Bangladesh still face a race against time however as they are to play a tri-nation one-day international tournament in Ireland from May 5 against Ireland and the West Indies.
""We hope we can field all our regular players in the tri-nation and World Cup. We hope to announce the squad in a day or two,"" said chief selector Minhajul Abedin.
The deadline for announcing World Cup squads is April 23, but teams can be changed up to May 23.

Bangladesh to call Shakib back from IPL for World Cup camp,"
DHAKA (AFP) - Bangladesh will ask star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan to return from Indian Premier League and join the team s World Cup preparation camp next week, the nation s Cricket Board said Monday.
Shakib is currently in India with his IPL franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad.
""Our camp is beginning. I have asked to send a letter to Shakib immediately to come back. Let s see how he responds to this,"" said Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hassan in Dhaka.
Shakib played just one game this season, picking up one wicket for 42 runs in 3.4 overs against his former franchise Kolkata Night Riders.
It was the only competitive game for Shakib since returning from an injury he picked up during the Bangladesh Premier League final in January.
In a star-studded line-up featuring Australia s David Warner, England s Jonny Bairstow, New Zealand s Kane Williamson, and Afghanistan duo Rashid Khan and Mohammad Nabi, Bangladesh is concerned Shakib might not get more matches in the coming days.
Unable to get enough games, Shakib recently invited his personal coach Mohammad Salahuddin to India in order to keep him ready for the World Cup.
Bangladesh will start their preparation camp for the tournament on April 22 and the team will leave for the UK in early May. They are scheduled to play a tri-nation tournament in Ireland from May 5-17.
The World Cup will be held in the UK from May 30 to July 14 with Bangladesh starting their campaign against South Africa at the Oval on June 2.

"Smith, Warner return for Australia's World Cup defence","
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The return of Steve Smith and David Warner to Australia’s squad for the Cricket World Cup came as little surprise on Monday but selectors still managed to cause a stir by omitting strike bowler Josh Hazlewood and in-form batsman Peter Handscomb.
Former skipper Smith and Warner were eligible for Aaron Finch’s side after their 12-month ball-tampering bans ended last month but their return put a squeeze on the batting positions that saw Handscomb drop out.
“Steve Smith and David Warner come back into the squad. Both are world class players and it has been pleasing to see them produce some good form in the IPL (Indian Premier League),” Chairman of Selectors Trevor Hohns said in a Cricket Australia statement.
Warner has registered five 50-plus scores, including an unbeaten century, for Sunrisers Hyderabad in seven IPL matches this season while Smith, returning from an elbow surgery like his former deputy, has also looked in good touch for Rajasthan Royals.
Spinners Nathan Lyon and Adam Zampa have made the cut, with selectors going for the pace of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Jhye Richardson and Jason Behrendorff, who has been in fine form in the IPL.
Hohns said Hazlewood, who has instead been named in the Australia A team for their tour of England in June-July, remained a big part of Australia’s Ashes plans.
The quick, who has taken 72 wickets in 44 one-dayers, has been sidelined since January due to a back injury but had been confident of being fit for the World Cup.
“Having not played at the highest level for some time, we feel this will provide him with the best preparation to get some quality cricket under his belt,” Hohns said.
“Our focus is to have Josh back bowling at his best for the commencement of a big Ashes tour.”
Starc and Richardson have both been selected subject to fitness.
“The advice from the CA medical team is they are progressing well and barring any setbacks will be available for selection ahead of our opening match against Afghanistan on June 1,” Hohns said.
Teams have to submit their 15-member squads by April 23 but injury replacements can be named until May 23.
Opener Usman Khawaja, player-of-the-series in Australia’s ODI series victory in India last month, was picked but may have to bat lower with Warner likely to partner Finch at the top.
Handscomb was left out despite his good form and the value he adds as a back-up stumper. Alex Carey has been named the sole wicketkeeper in the squad, which also contains all-rounders Marcus Stoinis and Glenn Maxwell.
The tournament, being hosted in England and Wales, runs from May 30 to July 14.
Squad: Aaron Finch (captain), Usman Khawaja, David Warner, Steve Smith, Shaun Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Jhye Richardson, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Jason Behrendorff, Nathan Lyon, Adam Zampa.

South Africa's Tahir tames dangerman Russell in vintage display,"
 NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Imran Tahir proved there is merit to the cricket adage that spinners get better with age after the South African claimed 4-27 in Chennai Super Kings’ five-wicket victory over Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Sunday.
The 40-year-old, who is set to shoulder South Africa’s spin duties in his final World Cup this year, helped Chennai to their seventh win in eight matches, tightening their grip on top spot on the IPL leaderboard.
The leg-spinner ended opener Chris Lynn’s 82-run blitz and dealt an even bigger blow to Kolkata’s hopes when he dismissed Andre Russell, who leads the IPL six-hitters’ list and has plundered 312 runs from seven innings with a 213-plus strike rate.
Having sent back Nitish Rana and Robin Uthappa in the space of three balls, Tahir returned to begin his eventful third over with a wide delivery at Kolkata’s Eden Gardens.
He sent back Lynn with his first legitimate delivery of that over but in walked Jamaican Russell, who hit the first ball he faced from Tahir for a four, defended the next, and then sent the following one sailing over the long-on ropes.
Tahir exacted revenge with the very next delivery, a flatter ball that Russell hit to substitute fielder Dhruv Shorey at long-on.
“I could’ve bowled one or two dot balls or may have conceded one (run) but I wanted to take the challenge,” the Pakistan-born spinner said after claiming his best IPL figures which also earned him the player-of-the-match award.
“I wanted to get him out, it’s as simple as that. He hit me for a six and a four which was fine but I got his wicket which was very important for the team, more than personal achievement. “He’s such a good player, especially in the death overs.”
While Tahir will play in one last World Cup he has no intention of retiring from the game just yet. “I don’t want to retire. I love the game, I have respect for the game and passion for the game,” he said. “(But) there is no other World Cup for me.”

Dinesh Karthik, 33, was given the second wicketkeeper’s slot over rising 21-year-old star Rishabh Pant.
Karthik’s form has been indifferent in recent games, but selectors valued his performance under pressure over the years.

"Pattinson, Harris get Cricket Australia contracts","
SYDNEY (AFP) - Fast bowler James Pattinson and opener Marcus Harris were among Cricket Australia’s nationally contracted players announced Monday, but there was no room for Cameron Bancroft, Peter Siddle, or Marnus Labuschagne.
The list of 20 men’s players offered deals for the 2019-2020 season on the basis of their performances over the past 12 months also included, as expected, Steve Smith and David Warner despite neither padding up during the period.
They were omitted last year after being banned over the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa. Bancroft, who was suspended for nine months over the same incident, missed out.
""We believe the 2019-20 contract list provides us with a versatile group of players who can represent Australia across all three formats over the contract period,"" said chief selector Trevor Hohns.
""Our key criteria focused on selecting a pool of players who are going to help us in our ambition to win the upcoming World Cup and Ashes series in England, and who can also play the various formats over the course of the Australian summer.""
Others to be overlooked included Joe Burns and Kurtis Patterson. They, along with Labuschagne, recently played Test cricket.
Matt Renshaw, Kane Richardson, Billy Stanlake, Andrew Tye, Mitchell Marsh and Ashton Agar, who previously had contracts, did not have them renewed.
Fast bowler Nathan Coulter-Nile, who wasn’t on the list last year, made the grade, but Pattinson was the biggest surprise having battled back from back surgery at the end of 2017.
The minimum value of a contract last season was Aus$286,000 (US$222,000). This year’s figure was not released.

Smith and Warner selected in Australia's World Cup squad,"
SYDNEY (AFP) - Ball-tamperers Steve Smith and David Warner were on Monday selected for Australia s World Cup squad, but there was no room for Josh Hazlewood or Peter Handscomb.
It is the first call-up for the former captain and his deputy since the expiry late last month of year-long bans for their part in the ""sandpapergate"" scandal in Cape Town that rocked cricket.
They were eligible for the final two games of Australia s recent limited-overs tour against Pakistan, but selectors preferred that they eased themselves back at the Twenty20 Indian Premier League.
Both grabbed the opportunity and have been in good touch, particularly the bombastic Warner who has made a blistering return.
It left coach Justin Langer with a dilemma on the back of the defending World Cup champions winning eight one-day internationals on the trot, against India and Pakistan.
All the top order have been firing, and it is Handscomb who is the fall guy despite averaging 43 in 13 games this year. The decision to drop him means the team only has one wicketkeeper in Alex Carey.
""We have been extremely pleased with how the ODI squad has been building over the past six months, including the recent series wins in India and against Pakistan in the UAE,"" said chief selector Trevor Hohns.
""Steve Smith and David Warner come back into the squad. Both are world-class players and it has been pleasing to see them produce some good form in the IPL.""
Australia s recent red-hot form has been built on the back of a rock-solid opening partnership between skipper Aaron Finch and Usman Khawaja.
The decision for Langer now is whether to retain that combination when the 50-over World Cup begins in England and Wales at the end of next month or move one of them down to make way for Warner, who traditionally opens the batting.
Shaun Marsh, Smith, Glenn Maxwell and all-rounder Marcus Stoinis make up the middle order.
Selectors opted for two spinners in Adam Zampa and Nathan Lyon and five quick bowlers.
As with the batsmen, Australia s selectors faced a bowling conundrum as they target a record sixth World Cup triumph.
Pat Cummins will spearhead the attack while Mitchell Starc, the 2015 World Cup player of the tournament, has been recalled after being sidelined with a muscle tear since early February.
But Hazlewood, who has been out of action since January with a back injury, missed out, with Hohns saying the focus was on having him ready for the Ashes Test series in England which begins in August.
Jhye Richardson, who dislocated his shoulder last month, makes the grade along with Nathan Coulter-Nile and Jason Behrendorff.
Hazlewood and Handscomb were instead named in Australia s A squad for their tour of England starting in June, which will provide opportunities for players to make their case to be included in the Ashes squad.
""Given the depth of talent and competition for spots there were a number of tough calls we had to make to settle on our squad of 15,"" said Hohns.
""Unfortunately, from the recent squad which toured India and the UAE, Peter Handscomb, Ashton Turner and Kane Richardson have made way for the above inclusions, but all three have been included in the Australia A squad for the tour of England.""
Australia World Cup squad: Aaron Finch (capt), Usman Khawaja, David Warner, Steve Smith, Shaun Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Jhye Richardson, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Jason Behrendorff, Nathan Lyon, Adam Zampa.

Pakistan second or third favourites for World Cup: Eoin Morgan,"
LONDON (Agencies) - England captain Eoin Morgan feels Pakistan are one of the strongest contenders for the upcoming ICC Men s Cricket World Cup 2019 that starts on 30 May.
Pakistan were recently clean-swept 5-0 by Australia in the United Arab Emirates, and questions were raised over the team s preparedness for the upcoming World Cup. However, Morgan feels that Pakistan are the  second or third favourites  for the tournament.
England, ranked No.1 on the MRF Tyres ICC ODI Team rankings, have been widely touted as favourites for the mega-event. They are now set to face-off with Pakistan in a one-off T20I on 5 May followed immediately by five ODIs – an exercise that is sure to further sharpen both sides before the World Cup.
""[The Pakistan series] is a nice way to ease into the summer and get some really good, competitive cricket going,"" said Morgan. ""Pakistan are probably second or third favourites for the tournament.
""They hold the Champions Trophy – playing extremely well to win that, in England – so it’s a series we’re all looking forward to.""
England have undergone major reform since the previous World Cup in 2015 in Australia and New Zealand, where they had suffered a humbling first round exit. Since then, they ve dominated the fifty-over format, particularly at home.
""Over the four years we’ve been together, we have had so many guys who have contributed to the position we find ourselves,"" Morgan reflected.
""We’ve gone past a 15-man squad of guys who can contribute into probably an 18-, 19-man squad who could all easily be selected for the final 15. And one benefit from having the Pakistan series in the build-up is that guys who are in form will get opportunities to stake their claim for World Cup positions.""

Williams century steers Zimbabwe to series win over UAE,"
HARARE (Agencies) - A third career ODI century for Sean Williams helped Zimbabwe notch their third win out of three against the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in Harare, as the home side prevailed by 131 runs.
Batting first, Zimbabwe posted 307/4 thanks largely to an excellent unbeaten 109 from Williams, supported by half-centuries from Craig Ervine (64) and Peter Moor (58*).
UAE, playing in their first full series against an ICC Full Member, could only reach 176 in reply, thus handing a series victory to their opponents.
Zimbabwe were put into bat by visiting captain Mohammad Naveed, and Williams was dominant throughout his effort, smashing seven fours and three sixes in his 84-ball knock having arrived at the crease in the 22nd over following Solomon Mire s dismissal for 40.
Moor and Williams added 145 for the fifth wicket, as Naveed (1/42) turned out to be the most effective bowler on a difficult day in the field for the tourists.
UAE were then playing catch up for the remainder of the match in pursuit of a difficult 308, and things were made worse when they lost three wickets inside the first six overs.
Chundangapoyil Rizwan (47) offered some resistance in the middle order, as did Muhammad Usman (49), but their contributions were in vain, as an impressive bowling performance kept at bay an unlikely resurgence in the latter stages of the affair.
Ryan Burl (3/31) was central in dismantling the UAE line-up, while Williams (0/34), Chris Mbofu (1/29), Donald Tiripano (1/16), Sikandar Raza (2/44) and Kyle Jarvis (2/20) all helped squeeze their opposition with economical contributions.
The win secured series victory with a game to spare, with the fourth and final bout scheduled to take place on Tuesday 16 April.

"India's Rahul, Pant await World Cup fate","
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Opener Lokesh Rahul and stumper-batsman Rishabh Pant are unlikely to sleep much on Sunday night as India selectors prepare to reveal their 15-man squad for the Cricket World Cup.
Chief selector M.S.K. Prasad has told reporters that most of the current side picks itself and there were only a couple of spots left up for grabs for the May 30 to July 14 showpiece in England and Wales.
So while there is not a great deal of suspense hanging over Monday’s scheduled news conference in Mumbai, speculation remains over who will fill at least two positions in the squad.
While India boast a formidable top order that includes captain Virat Kohli, the search continues for a reliable number four batsman. Pant, Ambati Rayudu, Vijay Shankar, Ajinkya Rahane, Manish Pandey and Dinesh Karthik have all been auditioned in the slot and all have been found wanting.
Rahul will fancy his chances as a back-up opener who can also bat at number four and his four 50-plus scores in the ongoing Indian Premier League could not have come at a better time. Pant is also angling for a back-up role, behind the stumps, with Mahendra Singh Dhoni installed as India’s first choice wicketkeeper.
A hard-hitter who can also be played as a specialist batsman, the 21-year-old faces competition from Karthik, whose ability to bat anywhere in the batting order makes him a limited-overs asset. However, Karthik, 33, was left out of the home series against Australia, India’s final dress rehearsal for the World Cup, which could signal a slide down the pecking order.
Former test stumper Kiran More says Pant should be on the plane to England. “If I am the selector, I will take Pant to the World Cup,” More told ESPNcricinfo. “I will punt on him, definitely, only because he is a match-winner. That is what he has done in test matches, he can win you games single-handedly. “He is a big-occasion player. He has got the guts to go for his shots, he is ruthless. If it clicks, it will benefit India immensely,” said More, a former chief selector.
Prasad and his selection committee colleagues will also weigh the relative merit of Shankar’s medium pace and Jadeja’s left-arm spin before naming the second all-rounder.
Hardik Pandya remains India’s first choice all-rounder while wrist-spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal are expected to share the slow bowling duties. India begin their bid for a third World Cup against South Africa in Southampton on June 5.

PCB thanks Rawalpindi over 2019 Pakistan Cup success,"
RAWALPINDI (Web Desk) – The Pakistan Cricket Board has thanked the passionate and lively Rawalpindi crowds for making the Mughal Steel Pakistan Cup 2019 a successful event. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reclaimed the title which they first won in 2016 when they defeated Balochistan by nine runs in a pulsating final in front of a packed to capacity Pindi Cricket Stadium on Friday.
PCB Director – Domestic, Haroon Rasheed, who attended Friday’s final, said the atmosphere was electrifying, which reflected the people’s passion and love for the game.
“On behalf of the Pakistan Cricket Board, I want to thank the cricket fans and followers who attended the event and made it a memorable one for the players and the event organisers. Fans are the PCB’s biggest asset and their support and acknowledgement is highly appreciated.
“The fans were generous in acknowledging good cricket and supporting players from the five provisional sides. This was a true reflection of our culture.
“The Pakistan Cup 2019 was played at the back of the Pakistan Super League 2019, and both the events demonstrated the Pakistan cricket fans’ involvement and passion. This event has once again sent out strong and powerful messages about us as Pakistanis.
“I also want to thank the respected members of the media, including PTV Sports, who gave excellent coverage to the event. Without their support, the players’ performances can never reach out to the wider audiences. Our thanks also go out to our valued commercial partners, who have continued to support this game.
“I will also like to appreciate the ground authorities, who produced pitches that provided high quality and entertaining cricket, and allowed the spectators to have a great time. I also want to thank the security agencies who worked tirelessly with the local administration to ensure a hassle free event. Finally, our congratulations to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for reclaiming the title and proving to be the deserving champions,” Haroon Rasheed said.
During the 11-day competition, seven centuries were scored with Khurram Manzoor’s 168 proving to be the highest individual score. There was something to smile for the bowlers as well with four bowlers claiming four or more wickets in an innings. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Wahab Riaz recorded the best bowling figures in the tournament when he claimed five for 52.
The highest match aggregate of the tournament was 685 runs when Sindh (385 for four) beat Federal Areas (300) by 85 runs. In the 11 matches, there were scores of 300 plus in 10 innings, while there were scores between 250 and 299 in 11 innings. The only time a target of 250 was not achieved was when Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan match was abandoned due to rain. Chasing 359 for victory, Balochistan were 129 for three in 17 overs when the match ended due to heavy rains.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa captain Salman Butt praised his team and termed the tournament a top-class event.
“The Pakistan Cup produced top quality cricket, we had to fight hard for our success. I owe it to my players, who raised their hands when it mattered the most. While it was a total team effort, we owe our success to some outstanding individual performances by our players during crunch moments, Khushdil Shah, Abid Ali, Umaid Asif, Wahab Riaz and Sohail Khan to name a few, delivered for us when it mattered most.”
The Mughal Steel Pakistan Cup 2019 saw some top-class performances with the bat and the ball.
Balochistan’s Umar Akmal, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Khushdil Shah, Punjab’s Iftikhar Ahmed and Khurram Manzoor hogged the headlines by their outstanding batting display throughout the tournament.
The foursome scored more than 300 runs each, with Umar topping the list with 342 runs in five games. He was adjudged Batsman of the Tournament. Umar was followed by Khushdil (316), Iftikhar (301) and Khurram (300).
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s fast bowler Wahab Riaz and Balochistan all-rounder Ammad Butt topped the bowlers’ chart with 10 wickets each and shared the best bowlers’ award.
All-rounder Hammad Azam made vital contributions for the Sindh outfit, his tally of 144 runs and nine wickets earned him the Best All-rounder of the Tournament award.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, apart from the glittering trophy, collected a cheque of PKR2 million, while Balochistan, the losing finalists received PKR1 million. The best batsman, bowler, all-rounder and player of the final received PKR100,000 each.

Stokes backs 'naturally gifted' Archer to make England World Cup squad,"
(Reuters) - England’s Ben Stokes believes fellow all-rounder Jofra Archer has a strong chance of being included in their World Cup squad, saying the “naturally gifted” player could improve any team in world cricket.
Barbados-born Archer, who shone for Sussex last season and in Australia’s Big Bash Twenty20 league for Hobart Hurricanes, is eligible for national selection under new England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB) residency rules.
The uncapped 24-year-old has played 28 first-class games and has a number of high-profile admirers, including former players Nasser Hussain and Devon Malcolm.
“Jofra makes any team better,” Stokes told The Doosra podcast on BBC Radio 5 Live.
“He is the most naturally gifted bowler I’ve seen and I don’t think he quite realises how good he is. Some of the things he can do at the click of a finger are just ‘wow’. It’s pretty special to watch.
“To have someone at the pace he bowls and the skills he has... the selectors are going to be scratching their heads... it’s a great position to be in as an England team when you’ve got a player with the skill level Jofra’s got.”
Archer and Stokes are team mates at Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League.
In February, England coach Trevor Bayliss said a decision over Archer was the “final piece of the jigsaw” in their World Cup plans.

‘During the shoot of Gumrah, Yash uncle had briefly mentioned about the story. Dharma Productions is like family; so when Karan approached me with the film, I had to do it. It is also a coincidence that my character is named Balraj, which is my father s [Sunil Dutt] real name. He too came from Pakistan during Partition, so it has an emotional connect,’ he added.
