Simon Taufel points out grave error in giving extra run to England against NZ in WC final,"Five-time ICC umpire of the year award-winning Australian umpire Simon Taufel has pointed out a grave error for awarding six runs to England instead of five in the final of World Cup 2019. Taufel, who is currently a part of the MCC’s laws sub-committee that makes the rules governing cricket, told an Australian based news channel that England should have been awarded five runs, not six. “It’s a clear mistake.. it’s an error of judgment,” Taufel said. “They (England) should have been awarded five runs, not six.” Taufel was considered among the best umpires of his time, he also said that tail-ender Adil Rashid should have been on strike for the penultimate delivery of the innings instead of Stokes.

Luck smiles on England as Eoin Morgan lifts World Cup trophy for first time,"LONDON: England made history on Sunday by winning the World Cup 2019 after a thrilling super over at the home of cricket, Lord’s. The underdog New Zealand equalized the total (15 runs) but the Eoin Morgan’s team had its name on the trophy due to scoring more boundaries in their batting innings. Needing to surpass New Zealand´s 241-8 to win the World Cup for the first time, England ended on 241 all out after Mark Wood was run out off the final ball. England was looking to Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler (59) to take them home after New Zealand sparked a top-order collapse but after a 110 runs crucial partnership Butler’s wicket gave a much-needed breakthrough to Willamson. Fergusson and Neesham took three wickets each, while Henry, and Grandhomme picked one wicket each. Three-times losing finalists England were in trouble at 86-4, chasing a target of 242, when Stokes and Buttler joined forces. But with 10 overs left, the host nation had recovered to 170-4, needing a further 72 runs for victory against 2015 runners-up New Zealand, also looking for a maiden World Cup win. Left-handed batsman Stokes, born in Christchurch, New Zealand, but brought up in England, was 43 not out and Buttler 42 not out. Earlier, fast bowler, Liam Plunkett dismissed New Zealand captain and star batsman Kane Williamson for just 30 before removing established opener Henry Nicholls for an innings-best 55 in a return of 3-42 from his 10 overs. Chris Woakes followed up with 3-37 as New Zealand finished on 241-8. New Zealand successfully defended a total of 239 in their shock semi-final win over India, when they reduced one of the world´s strongest batting line-up to 24-4. And Trent Boult almost struck with the first ball of England´s chase when he appealed for lbw against Jason Roy but South African umpire Marais Erasmus´s original not out the decision was upheld. Roy, who made a blistering 85 in a comfortable semi-final win over reigning champions Australia, got England going with a straight-driven four off Matt Henry. Roy and Jonny Bairstow, by average the best opening pair in one-day international history, had posted four consecutive century stands coming into the final. Early breakthrough
But New Zealand got the breakthrough they needed when Henry induced Roy, on 17, to edge a full-length delivery that just carried to wicketkeeper Tom Latham. That left England , who thrashed New Zealand by 119 runs in a group match, 28-1 in the sixth over. New batsman Joe Root never looked comfortable while making seven off 30 balls and was caught behind to leave England 59-2. Bairstow had enjoyed a huge reprieve on 18 when Colin de Grandhomme dropped a routine caught-and-bowled chance but fast bowler Lockie Ferguson got him to play on for 36. Jimmy Neesham took a wicket with his first ball, with England captain Eoin Morgan falling for just nine when an uppercut was brilliantly caught low down by Ferguson running in from deep point. But Stokes and Buttler revived England with some well-struck boundaries. Williamson chose to bat after winning the toss in overcast conditions and on a green pitch but opener Martin Guptill, the leading run-scorer at the 2015 World Cup, was lbw to Woakes for 19. That left number three Williamson, who started the match with 548 runs in the tournament at an average of 91.33, having to mount yet another rescue mission. But after putting on 74 for the second wicket with Nicholls, he fell when he edged a rising cross-seamer from Plunkett to wicketkeeper Buttler. New Zealand found themselves 118-3 when Plunkett struck for the second time in 14 balls. Nicholls, who had completed a 71-ball fifty, was out for 55 when he played on after being cramped for room by a Plunkett delivery that curved back into him and veteran Ross Taylor could only manage 15 before falling lbw to Mark Wood. Latham defiantly hit Wood for six but his valuable 47 off 56 balls ended when he chipped a low Woakes full toss to mid-off.

World Cup Final: New Zealand sets a mild target of 242 runs for England,"LONDON: New Zealand, in World Cup 2019 finale on Sunday, set a mild target of 242 runs for host England here at Lord’s, London. Henry Nicholls, with 55 runs, and Tom Latham with 47 runs remained the only Kiwi top scorers of the day. Followed by skipper Kane Williamson with 30 runs. Chris Woakes and Liam Plunkett dismissed three Englishmen each while Jofra Archer and Mark Wood both took one wicket each. When England exited the 2015 edition with an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh, few were tipping them as potential champions in four years’ time. As England captain Eoin Morgan put it, “If you had offered us the position to play in a final the day after we were knocked out of the 2015 World Cup, I would have laughed at you.” One person not laughing was Andrew Strauss, the former England director of cricket. Drafted into the newly created role, Strauss set about an overhaul that saw the former England captain appoint Australia’s Trevor Bayliss as coach, and place greater emphasis on white-ball cricket. The worth of all that work showed when Morgan’s men, now top of the one-day international rankings, thrashed reigning champions Australia by eight wickets in the semi-final at Edgbaston on Thursday. Many of the elements that made England the pre-tournament favourites were on show in Birmingham. Pacemen Jofra Archer and Chris Woakes reduced Australia to 14-3, leg-spinner Adil Rashid took wickets in the middle and the dynamic duo of Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow — statistically the most successful opening pair in ODI history — launched the run chase with a blistering century partnership. ‘Fearless’ cricket  The challenge for England is to embrace the hype surrounding Sunday’s fixture without letting it inhibit them from playing their brand of “fearless” cricket. By reaching the final, England have guaranteed an international match will be shown live on free-to-air television in Britain for the first time since the iconic 2005 Ashes series — a chance to inspire a new generation. “I think Sunday’s not a day to shy away from, it’s a day to look forward to,” said Morgan, an outrider in English cricket in becoming an ODI specialist when the steely Dubliner realised his Test career had stalled. It is perhaps appropriate that England are facing New Zealand in a final between two sides who have yet to win the World Cup. For it was the Black Caps who showed England how to play the modern one-day game at the 2015 edition in Wellington four years ago. They shot out England for just 123 and then overhauled that total in a mere 12.2 overs. “It was as close to rock-bottom as I’ve been”, said Morgan. “Certainly as a captain and as a player, being beaten off the park like that was humiliating.” England gained a measure of revenge with a 119-run thrashing of New Zealand in a group-stage match earlier in this World Cup. But that is unlikely to count for much on Sunday. All tournament long, the same comment has been made about New Zealand — they boast a well-balanced attack led by left-arm quick Trent Boult but are over-reliant on captain Kane Williamson and fellow senior batsman Ross Taylor for their runs. The polite Kiwis have responded by continuing to “scrap”, in the phrase of fast bowler Lockie Ferguson, their way to wins as demonstrated by their dramatic 18-run semi-final victory over India. Boult and Matt Henry reduced one of the world’s most powerful top orders to 5-3, before left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner, aided by superb fielding, backed them up after Williamson and Taylor had made battling fifties on a tricky pitch. While many members of the home side were not even born when England made the last of three losing appearances in a World Cup final in 1992, the Black Caps have the experience of their heavy defeat by co-hosts Australia in the climax of the 2015 edition in Melbourne to call on. “I’d be lying if I said we weren’t a bit overawed by the change of scenery,” said Taylor as he looked back to New Zealand’s first and only match on Australian soil in that tournament. “I think we know what to expect, the pressures that come with it, we’ve been there before.

"World Cup Final: England, New Zealand clash to claim golden trophy today","LONDON: England face New Zealand in the World Cup final today knowing years of planning come down to a single day at Lord’s.

Jason Roy cleared to play World Cup final despite umpire outburst,"BIRMINGHAM: England star Jason Roy has been cleared to play in Sunday’s World Cup final against New Zealand despite showing dissent at an umpire’s decision while helping the hosts book their place in the showpiece match. The Surrey opener had made 85 to set England well on their way to an eventual eight-wicket against Australia in Thursday’s semi-final at Edgbaston when he was given out caught behind down the legside off fast bowler Pat Cummins by Sri Lankan umpire Kumar Dharmasena. Roy requested a review but England had already squandered their lone review of the innings with an unsuccessful attempt to overturn fellow opener Jonny Bairstow´s lbw dismissal for 34. Nevertheless, Dharmasena confusingly and incorrectly signalled for a review, with Australia pointing out the official’s mistake. Roy, his arms spread wide, clearly believed Dharmasena should have signalled a wide delivery instead and the furious batsman had to be ushered away from the crease by square leg umpire Marais Erasmus. Eventually, a clearly unhappy Roy, whose tirade prompted television broadcasters to apologise for his foul language, made his way back to the pavilion, with England 147 for two in the 20th over. Roy, who admitted the offence, was fined 30 per cent of his match fee for breaching that section of the International Cricket Council’s code of conduct that prohibits showing dissent at an umpire’s decision. The 28-year-old also received two demerit points from match referee Ranjan Madugalle, taking his tally for the tournament to three following a one-point penalty he received for an audible obscenity after dropping a catch in a group-stage match against Pakistan. But match bans only kick in when a player collects four demerit points in total leaving Roy, a key figure in Eoin Morgan’s side, available to feature as England bid to win the World Cup for the first time.

England makes into final of World Cup after 27 years by thrashing Aussies,"BIRMINGHAM: England beat Australia in second Semi- final to make their place into World Cup final after the wait of 27 years. Last time they made into finals playing against Imran Khan led Pakistan team in 1992 where they suffered defeat. Eoin Morgan´s side ended Australia´s bid to retain the World Cup in ruthless fashion at Edgbaston, dismissing their old rivals for 223 and then powering to victory in 32.1 overs thanks to Jason Roy´s blistering 85. England will head to Lord´s bidding to win the 50-over World Cup for the first time, with 2015 runners-up New Zealand, who they thrashed by 119 runs in the group stage, standing between Morgan´s men and the trophy. England, who were in the semi-finals for the first time since 1992, have lost all three of their World Cup finals. The most recent of those painful defeats came in 1992 when Graham Gooch´s side were beaten by Pakistan, while Australia in 1987 and the West Indies in 1979 have also denied England in the final. Australia´s first-ever World Cup semi-final defeat, after seven previous victories at this stage, shattered the five-time champions´ hopes of reaching the final for the sixth time in the past seven editions. While Australia lick their wounds before facing England in the Ashes next month, the progress of Morgan´s team comes after a four-year overhaul. England´s woeful first-round exit at the 2015 World Cup prompted a root-and-branch reform of their approach to one-day internationals for a side that had long placed Test success above all other considerations. Australian coach Trevor Bayliss was drafted in, sparking an impressive transformation that has seen England climb to number one in the ODI rankings and move to within touching distance of World Cup glory.

World Cup Semi-Final: England restricts Australia to 223 runs,"BIRMINGHAM: Host England, on Thursday, restricted Australia to 223 runs in the second semi-final here at Edgbaston, Birmingham. Steve Smith, with 83 runs, and Alex Carey, with 46 runs remained the only top scorers on the Kangaroo side. Chris Woakes and Adil Rashid both dismissed three Englishmen while Jofra Archer and Mark Wood got two and one wicket respectively. Australia, in the second semi-final clash, opted to bat first against England here at Edgbaston, Birmingham on Thursday. Four years of planning will be put on the line for England when they face holders Australia in a blockbuster World Cup semi-final at Edgbaston today. England’s woeful first-round exit at the 2015 edition prompted a complete rethink of their approach to one-day internationals for a side that had long placed Test success above all other considerations. Australian coach Trevor Bayliss was drafted in with the aim of guiding their bid for a first World Cup title. The transformation has been impressive, with England climbing to number one in the ODI rankings under the astute captaincy of Eoin Morgan. Their rise to the summit has been based on dynamic run-scoring, with in-form openers Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow leading the way. But the stakes for hosts England are higher than simply the winning of a match that would see them into a final against New Zealand at Lord´s on Sunday. Host broadcaster Sky has said it will allow the final to be shown on free-to-air television in Britain — but only if England are involved in the showpiece match. It would be the first time since 2005 that a major England men’s home match had emerged from behind a UK television paywall, with cricket having a chance to reconnect with a ‘lost’ audience in its birthplace. But Morgan urged England to avoid being overawed by the scale of the task confronting them in Birmingham. “Sometimes I’m guilty of it, you can lose sight of the position you´re in and the fact you´re living your dream,” Morgan said on Wednesday. Australia, however, have never lost any of their seven previous World Cup semi-finals — although they did tie with South Africa at Edgbaston 20 years ago before advancing into the final thanks to their superior net run-rate from the preceding ‘Super Six’ stage. England had won 10 of their last 11 ODIs against Australia prior to the World Cup. But that counted for nothing when Australia landed a psychological blow in the group stage, beating Ashes rivals England by 64 runs at Lord´s last month. Australia left-arm quicks Jason Behrendorff and Mitchell Starc shared nine wickets between them in a match where Australia captain Aaron Finch made 100 after surviving a testing opening from England´s fast bowlers. ‘Different team’ Roy, however, was missing with a torn hamstring and since his return, England have secured crucial wins over India and New Zealand that took them into the semi-finals. “We’re probably more confident than we were three games ago, we’re a different team,” Morgan said. “It feels like we´re back to the team we are.” Meanwhile, Australia, who have not won in any format at Edgbaston since the 2001 Ashes Test, suffered a surprise 10-run defeat by South Africa at Old Trafford in their final group game. England, as well as finding a way to cope with Starc, will have to contain the run-scoring threat of a powerful Australian top order. David Warner has scored 638 runs this tournament following the left-handed opener’s return to international cricket after a 12-month ban for his role in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa. But they will be without Usman Khawaja after the batsman suffered a tournament-ending hamstring injury against South Africa, while speculation about Glenn Maxwell’s place intensified when the struggling all-rounder did not attend training on Wednesday. “It’s a purely optional training session, you’re reading a bit too much into it,” said Finch on Wednesday when asked about Maxwell, who has scored just 155 runs in nine innings. Australia are bidding for a sixth World Cup title, having won four of the last five editions. “We’re full of confidence going into this game, but England have been front runners in one-day cricket for the last four years,” said opener Finch. “It will come down to whoever holds their nerve and whoever holds their half-chances.” With input from AFP.

"World Cup: England, Australia clash in second semi-final today","BIRMINGHAM: Four years of planning will be put on the line for England when they face holders Australia in a blockbuster World Cup semi-final at Edgbaston today. England’s woeful first-round exit at the 2015 edition prompted a complete rethink of their approach to one-day internationals for a side that had long placed Test success above all other considerations. Australian coach Trevor Bayliss was drafted in with the aim of guiding their bid for a first World Cup title. The transformation has been impressive, with England climbing to number one in the ODI rankings under the astute captaincy of Eoin Morgan. Their rise to the summit has been based on dynamic run-scoring, with in-form openers Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow leading the way. But the stakes for hosts England are higher than simply the winning of a match that would see them into a final against New Zealand at Lord´s on Sunday. Host broadcaster Sky has said it will allow the final to be shown on free-to-air television in Britain — but only if England are involved in the showpiece match. It would be the first time since 2005 that a major England men’s home match had emerged from behind a UK television paywall, with cricket having a chance to reconnect with a ‘lost’ audience in its birthplace. But Morgan urged England to avoid being overawed by the scale of the task confronting them in Birmingham. “Sometimes I’m guilty of it, you can lose sight of the position you´re in and the fact you´re living your dream,” Morgan said on Wednesday. Australia, however, have never lost any of their seven previous World Cup semi-finals — although they did tie with South Africa at Edgbaston 20 years ago before advancing into the final thanks to their superior net run-rate from the preceding ‘Super Six’ stage. England had won 10 of their last 11 ODIs against Australia prior to the World Cup. But that counted for nothing when Australia landed a psychological blow in the group stage, beating Ashes rivals England by 64 runs at Lord´s last month. Australia left-arm quicks Jason Behrendorff and Mitchell Starc shared nine wickets between them in a match where Australia captain Aaron Finch made 100 after surviving a testing opening from England´s fast bowlers. ‘Different team’ Roy, however, was missing with a torn hamstring and since his return, England have secured crucial wins over India and New Zealand that took them into the semi-finals. “We’re probably more confident than we were three games ago, we’re a different team,” Morgan said. “It feels like we´re back to the team we are.” Meanwhile, Australia, who have not won in any format at Edgbaston since the 2001 Ashes Test, suffered a surprise 10-run defeat by South Africa at Old Trafford in their final group game.

"World Cup: Semi-final to resume today between India, New Zealand","MANCHESTER: The semi-final clash between New Zealand and India will resume on Wednesday after rain halted the match on Tuesday with Kiwis scoring 211 with 5 wickets down. Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor scored 67 runs while Indian bowlers all got one wicket each. After weeks of close encounters and edge of the seat thrillers, India will take on New Zealand in the first semi-final of the World Cup at Old Trafford in Manchester on Tuesday. Today’s contest will be a repeat of the semi-finals of the 2008 ICC Under-19 World Cup in which a Virat Kohli-led India defeated a Kane Williamson-captained New Zealand in Kuala Lumpur. India, whose group match against 2015 runners-up New Zealand was washed out, have suffered just one defeat at this World Cup so far, against England, and ended on top of the 10-team group stage, making them strong favourites to beat the Black Caps. The Kiwis who were deemed favourites at the start of the tournament kicked off their World Cup campaign on a high, but suffered defeats and only qualified for the semi-finals in fourth place on the basis of net run-rate. They lost their last three games — against Pakistan, holders Australia and England. For New Zealand, skipper Williamson has been in fine form, making match-winning hundreds against South Africa and the West Indies. But the rest of the top order have had a largely forgettable World Cup, with the Black Caps losing 13 wickets in the powerplay at just 23.38 each — the worst record in the competition. Williamson’s 481 tournament runs represent nearly 29 per cent of New Zealand’s total at this World Cup. On the other hand, India’s success at this World Cup has been built on the heavy scoring of a Rohit Sharma-led batting top order. Sharma became the first batsman to score five centuries in a single World Cup when he made 103 in a seven-wicket win over Sri Lanka at Headingley on Saturday, while fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah has been the spearhead of a well-balanced bowling attack.

1992 vs 2019 World Cup: Memes played crucial part in keeping hopes alive for Pakistani fans,"BY: Maryam Qureshi Rollercoaster ride it has been for Pakistan’s cricket team. ‘Unpredictable’ is the term locals use to define this team and no doubt they are unpredictable, from turning an easy target by taking it to 6 on 6. Exactly when everything was taking a turn so did social media posts, from bashing Sarfaraz Ahmed about his unfit body to scolding Shoaib Malik on eating burgers, now all limelight was being shifted to the similarities between the pattern of 1992’s World Cup and 2019’s. Now that Pakistan is officially disqualified from 2019 World Cup I will shed some light on how meme game took turns. Fans started to take notes of the eerie similarities between 1992 and 2019’s World Cup regarding Pakistan’s pattern of losing and wining. Within a day my Facebook feed was flooding with posts saying ‘Ye World Cup humara’   People linking the similarities in every way they could, however failing to realize cricket game is not merely about repeating past events in favor of a team. If this would have been the case, everyday would be the same as Sun rises and Moon sets in a similar pattern and anyone could have said ‘Oh the Moon also rose in the same manner as yesterday, hence this day will exactly be same like yesterday’s .’ But this is not the case, no one can stay dependent on past events. Pakistan started performing well while beating New Zealand, from 6th ranking Pakistan was now on 4th and how could fans resist from making memes. The ‘men in green’ were proud, all hail to Babar Azam’s outstanding performance. Here is a link to one such meme which made me laugh.  During the very match a comparison was also broadcasted between Pakistan’s pattern of winning and losing in 1992 and 2019, well then the picture got clearer that fans were not only noticing but well known commentators were also well aware of this spooky similarity. This too was turned into a hilarious meme.    Have you ever noticed Pakistan’s cricket fans supporting India? NO. But the entire nation was found hooting for India’s win when Pakistan’s access into Semi-Finals was dependent on their victory. I was shopping with my mother while I overheard a few shopkeepers talking ‘Dua kero India jeet jae achay margin se’ Well, this time I wasn’t shocked as we were depending on India for our ticket to semi final. Right when India’s team was not only being supported by their country but by the neighboring country too, Indian players ‘intentionally lost the match’ as said by many Pakistani cricket fans. Batsmen were seen brisk walking on the pitch while making singles and no doubt their actions were clear. Relying on a rival for a gesture which could get Pakistani team into semis was not a good option. India lost and meme generators were active again (Well.. they are never inactive)   This meme showing M.S Dhoni holding a banner saying ‘Apna game khud jeeto’  It might be funny for some and thought to provoke for many. If Pakistani players performed well in past matches then waiting for India’s win would not have been a matter of concern for Pakistani fans. One must understand, Pakistan getting into Finals should not be reliant on India’s performance or the past performances in 1992. In 1992 Imran Khan was the captain whereas in 2019 Sarfaraz Ahmed is the captain. Khan married thrice doesn’t mean that Ahmed would too similarly pattern of winning or losing could have been noticed till generating memes but not for a country’s winning or losing probability. Game is all about losing and winning, I have said this before and I will say it again ‘Tum jeeto ya haaro suno, humein tumse pyar hai’  Long way to go green shirts, I will support you but I would also like to add the fact that if Pakistan’s run rate was maintained at a better number, we might have been a part of Semis Or Finals as players and not as audience.

Mixed feelings for Mickey Arthur as Pakistan out of World Cup,"Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur admitted his side’s failed World Cup campaign left him with mixed feeling as they crashed out despite beating Bangladesh by 94 runs on Friday. To reach the semi-finals, Pakistan needed to rewrite the record books with the biggest margin of victory in a one-day international. But they came up short as their 315-9 meant Bangladesh had to be bowled out for just eight at Lord’s. That impossible task was quickly put to bed as Bangladesh reached eight runs in the second over, allowing New Zealand to join Australia, India and England into the semi-finals. Pakistan secured 11 points in nine games, as many as New Zealand scored, but were ousted on an inferior net run-rate. Arthur, whose contract with Pakistan ends after the tournament, said it was a disappointing conclusion to a campaign that had plenty of highs and lows. “It hasn’t ended as we would have liked to have ended it. It’s been a campaign of ifs and buts,” Arthur told reporters. “If we have a look through our first five games and we have a look through our last five, it’s a campaign of two halves, which has been disappointing.” Pakistan had just one win, against hosts England, from five games with three defeats, including a loss to arch rivals India, and a no-result. Inspirational Sarfaraz –
They staged a comeback by winning the next four games but still failed to qualify. Arthur said the task of achieving a huge win against Bangladesh was targeted at the start but became impossible due to the slowness of the pitch. “I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a discussion. We won the toss, which was a good start. Getting 400 is a platform. The message we got from Fakhar (Zaman) when he came back in the change room was it was slow and tough to score,” Arthur said. Arthur admitted a seven-wicket defeat against the West Indies in the first game hurt his team badly. “If we go back, the West Indies game, the first game of the tournament, when you lose like we lost, it’s almost impossible to get back on net run rate, that was disappointing,” said Arthur. Arthur labelled his team’s wins over semi-finalists England and New Zealand as the main highlights. “It’s nice to sit here and know we’ve beaten two of those top four teams during our campaign, which shows we are not a mile off in terms of where we are as a cricket team,” he said. Arthur praised Pakistan skipper Sarfaraz Ahmed for helping the resurgence after being severely criticised for the India defeat. “I must say that I’d just like to credit the captain, Sarfaraz. What he was exposed to after the Indian game was atrocious as a Pakistan cricket captain, as any captain of any cricket team,” he said. “The way he held his composure, the way he led from the front, the way his work ethic never, ever changed. I think he’s been an inspiration to that dressing room, and I think Sarfaraz deserves a lot of credit for this.” AFP ",https://www.newsone.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mickey-arthur.jpg,World Cup 2019,"“If we go back, the West Indies game, the first game of the tournament, when you lose like we lost, it’s almost impossible to get back on net run rate, that was disappointing,” said Arthur.",neutral
World Cup 2019: Pakistan defeats Bangladesh by 94 runs,"LONDON: Pakistan, in their last World Cup 2019 match on Friday, defeated Bangladesh by 94 runs here at Lord’s, London.

Shakib Al Hassan, with 64 runs, remained the only top scorer of Bangladesh who got restricted to 221. Pakistan team hopes to qualify for Semi-Finals vanishes before the match could come to an end as the green shirts managed to score 315 which means Bangladesh has to be bowled out for seven runs, which is seemingly out of the equation. Captain Sarfaraz Ahmed who said in the press conference, a day earlier that Pakistan was looking to score five hundred against the Bengali tigers but his team played with the intent of scoring runs between 300to 320 from the outset. Imam Ul-Haq scored his first century at the World Cup marking an end to his tournament followed by 96 runs scored by Babar Azam. Captain Sarfaraz Ahmed was retired hurt as he came in between the shot hit by Imad Wasim– the ball hitting his elbow. A win for Pakistan can bring them equal to New Zealand but despite the same points, Pakistan will not qualify for Semi-Finals due to the low run rate.

ECC restores old gas tariff for tandoors to decrease prices of naan and roti,"ISLAMABAD: A day after Prime Minister Imran Khan ordered to bring down prices of naan and roti to their previous rates throughout the country, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) on Wednesday reverted the gas tariff for non-commercial tandoors to the pre-June 30 level. Adviser to Prime Minister on Finance Hafeez Shaikh presided the meeting and approved measures to decrease the prices. The decision was taken on a proposal submitted by the Ministry of Energy to revise gas prices for roti tandoors. The ECC will provide Rs1.51 billion to subsidise such gas connections. The committee instructed provincial governments to restore the rates of naan and roti to the pre-June 30 level and warned provincial governments that the federal government will withdraw the subsidy if the prices are not restored. As per the decision, a detailed survey of tandoors across the country will be carried out in order to make certain that the benefit of revision in gas tariff is implemented to stand-alone tandoors or roadside restaurants catering to the poor and no undue benefit is passed on to the tandoors in hotels or larger restaurants which are to be treated as commercial gas connections. A report on price of wheat was also reviewed by the ECC. the price has been reduced by Rs50-60 per 40kg after a ban on its export, according to the report. The meeting also decided that a session of the National Price Monitoring Committee (NPMC) will be convened on August 8.

Bilawal advises Sanjrani to resign before opposition casts no-trust vote on Aug 1,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari hosted a luncheon for opposition senators on Wednesday, as final arrangements being made for tomorrow’s Senate session during which voting for the no-trust motion against Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani would be held. More than 50 senators from the PPP, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), National Party (NP), Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PMAP), Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI), Awami National Party (ANP), and erstwhile FATA attended the lunch hosted in the Senate’s banquet hall, following which Bilawal told reporters that Sanjrani still had time to voluntarily resign if he wanted. Reiterating that the opposition has more than enough numbers to defeat the Senate chairman, Bilawal said, “If Sadiq Sanjrani sahib has decided to resign even now, it will be a good decision.” “It would have been good if the Senate chairman had resigned, otherwise he is going tomorrow anyway,” he asserted. The ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) had announced on Tuesday that the voting for the no-trust motion against Sanjrani would be held on August 1. Leader of the House in the Senate Syed Shibli Faraz had also maintained that the government had no intention of using delaying tactics, adding that the agenda of the day would be circulated among the senators on Wednesday. Faraz today discarded the talk of Sanjrani resigning, saying he will fight the election “till the last man [and] the last moment”. Stressing that the government had trust in the Senate chairman, Faraz accused opposition members of spreading the rumours regarding Sanjrani’s resignation. Sources indicated that Sanjrani, after consultation with party and government members, had declined to resign and instead contest the resolution. Meanwhile, the opposition’s joint candidate for Senate chairman, Mir Hasil Bizenjo, while speaking to reporters said that he had already won “the day my name was put forward”. Claiming to have the support of 65 opposition senators, Bizenjo too recommended Sanjrani to resign. “It would be better for him as well as for us,” he said. PPP’s Khursheed Shah warned the government to “stay away from horse-trading” in the matter of the no-trust vote. “Horse-trading has prevented the country from progressing,” the former leader of opposition said, adding that opposition members were “respectable and honourable”. Also on Wednesday, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman met Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shahbaz Sharif at his Islamabad residence and discussed tomorrow’s crucial vote. The two leaders also discussed the overall political and economic situation of the country and the future strategy of the opposition. Earlier today, Shahbaz presided a meeting of the coordination committee of PML-N senators here at the federal capital. “The opposition is united,” the PML-N president was quoting as saying at the gathering. The election for a new Senate chairman will be a “victory for democracy and the Constitution,” he added. Asserting that the opposition will face no hurdle in the way of victory based on numbers, Shehbaz said, “the opposition holds a clear majority in the Senate chairman’s election.” ",https://www.newsone.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shehbaz-bilawal-fazalu-1.jpg,Pakistan,"Leader of the House in the Senate Syed Shibli Faraz had also maintained that the government had no intention of using delaying tactics, adding that the agenda of the day would be circulated among the senators on Wednesday.",neutral

"Hamza bin Laden, son of Al-Qaeda founder, is dead: US official","The United States believes that Hamza bin Laden, a son of slain Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and himself a notable figure in the militant group, is dead, a US official said on Wednesday. The US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, provided no further details, including when Hamza died or where. President Donald Trump earlier on Wednesday declined to comment afterNBC Newsfirst reported the US assessment. Asked if he had intelligence that bin Laden’s son had been killed, Trump told reporters: “I don’t want to comment on it.” Separately, the White House declined to comment on whether any announcement was imminent. Hamza, believed to be about 30 years old, was at his father’s side in Afghanistan before the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and spent time with him in Pakistan after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan pushed much of Al Qaeda’s senior leadership there, according to the Brookings Institution. Osama bin Laden was killed by US special forces who raided his compound in Pakistan in 2011. Hamza was thought to be under house arrest in Iran at the time, and documents recovered from the compound indicated that aides had been trying to reunite him with his father. The New York Timesreported that the United States had a role in the operation that led to Hamza’s death, which it said took place in the past two years.Reuterscould not immediately verify those details. Still, the US government’s conclusion appears to be a recent one.

Introduced by Al Qaeda’s chief Ayman al-Zawahiri in an audio message in 2015, Hamza provided a younger voice for the group whose ageing leaders have struggled to inspire militants around the world galvanised by Islamic State, according to analysts. Hamza called for acts of terrorism in Western capitals and threatened to take revenge against the United States for his father’s killing, the US State Department said in 2017 when it designated him as a global terrorist. He also threatened to target Americans abroad and urged tribal groups in Saudi Arabia to unite with Yemen’s Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to fight against Saudi Arabia, it said.

US puts sanctions on Iranian FM Javad Zarif,"The United States has imposed sanctions on Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, the latest move by Washington in its “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran. The Treasury Department said on Wednesday that it was imposing sanctions on Zarif for acting on behalf of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “Javad Zarif implements the reckless agenda of Iran’s Supreme Leader, and is the regime’s primary spokesperson around the world,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. Zarif brushed off the sanctions on Twitter, saying the US move indicated Washington saw him as a “threat”. “It has no effect on me or my family, as I have no property or interest outside of Iran,” he said. Fears of a direct US-Iranian conflict have risen since May with several suspected attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf, Iran’s downing of a US surveillance drone, and a plan for US air raids on Iran last month that Trump called off at the last minute.

Afghanistan highway blast kills at least 34 on bus,"KABUL: An explosion on Wednesday hit a bus traveling on a highway between two key cities in western Afghanistan, killing at least 34 passengers, including children, and injuring 17, officials said. Security has been deteriorating across Afghanistan, with the Taliban and Daesh fighters mounting near-daily attacks on Afghan forces, government employees and civilians. The blast on the highway linking the provincial capitals of Herat and Kandahar took place in the Ab Khorma area of Farah province, said provincial police spokesman Mohibullah Mohib. “The bomb was freshly planted by the Taliban insurgents to target Afghan and foreign security forces,” he said. Taliban officials were not immediately available to comment on the statement and there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Government and aid officials say the numbers of those being killed and maimed is rising because of explosives newly planted by the Taliban, who now control more territory than at any point since their ouster nearly 18 years ago. The attack came one day after the United Nations said civilians are being killed and wounded at a “shocking” level in Afghanistan’s war, despite a push to end the nearly 18-year-old conflict. Casualties have dropped 27 per cent in the first half of 2019 compared to the same period last year, which was a record, but nonetheless, 1,366 civilians were killed and another 2,446 injured. The UN branded efforts to reduce the violence “insufficient”. It also said that US and pro-government forces caused more civilian deaths than the Taliban and other insurgent groups for the second quarter running. Child casualties represented almost one-third of the overall total of civilian casualties. Wednesday’s blast comes ahead of presidential elections next month, when US officials and Taliban representatives are also due to resume talks to agree a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign forces in exchange for security guarantees.

52 killed in Brazil prison riot,"RIO DE JANEIRO: At least 52 inmates were killed in a prison riot in northern Brazil on Monday as rival gang factions fought each other, an official said. Sixteen of the dead were decapitated in the second major eruption of violence to rock the country’s severely overpopulated and deadly prison system in as many months. Fighting broke out in the Altamira Regional Recovery Centre at around 7am, an official from the Para state government’s penitentiary department said. Two guards were taken hostage during the hours-long clashes, which were brought under control at around midday. They were eventually freed. Brazilian TV stations showed footage of thick black smoke rising from the prison compound and people sitting on the roof of a building. Other images showed flames inside a building that almost reached the ceiling and people, apparently prisoners, sitting on the ground outside. “It is likely that many detainees died from asphyxiation (from smoke),” the government official said, adding the death toll could rise. Around 300 prisoners were being held at the jail, the official said, which reportedly has a capacity for 200. An outbreak of violence in the same prison in September 2018 left at least seven inmates dead, local media reported previously. Guards had apparently foiled an attempted prison escape. In May this year, at least 55 prisoners were killed in several jails in the neighbouring state of Amazonas in violence also blamed on an apparent drug trafficking gang dispute. Most of the victims were killed by asphyxiation, the state government said at the time. The federal government dispatched reinforcements to boost security in the jails. Brazil has the world’s third largest prison population after the United States and China, with 726,712 inmates as of June 2016, according to official statistics. The population is roughly double the capacity of the nation’s jails, which in the same year was estimated to be 368,049 inmates. The federal government had been expected to add another 115,000 inmates by the end of 2018, Human Rights Watch said in a recent report. Around 40 percent of the prison population is made up of pretrial detainees. Along with severe overcrowding and gang violence, riots and breakout attempts in Brazil’s prisons are not uncommon. Experts have described conditions in the country’s jails as inhuman, with most inmates poor, black and with little formal education. AFP.
