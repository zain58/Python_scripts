Majority of senators believe in transparency: Dr Firdous ,"
ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan on Thursday has said that majority of the senators believe in transparency of the system.
Talking to media, Dr Firdous pointed out at the voting of no-confidence motion against Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani and said that whatever is going on in the upper house has nothing to do with democracy.

Earlier, Dr Firdous said  that Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leaders have no courage to listen to the truth of Special Assistant on Accountability Shahzad Akbar.
She said that PML-N leaders are resorting to mud-slinging on Shahzad Akbar as they have no evidence to prove their innocence. Those who plundered the national exchequer will have to face accountability in Naya Pakistan, she asserted.

Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani survives no-confidence motion in surprise victory,"
ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – The no-trust motion against Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani, tabled by Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Raja Zafarul Haq, has been rejected on Thursday. 
A total of 100 senators, including Sanjrani, took part in the polling process. Senator Javed Abbasi was appointed the polling agent on behalf of the opposition, while Senator Nauman Wazir was appointed on behalf of the government.
50 votes were received in favour of the no-confidence motion while the opposition needed at least 53 votes for the resolution to be passed but fell just three votes short of victory. 
The upper House took up the first-ever no-trust motions against its chairman and deputy chairman, both of them cannot chair the session according to the rules; hence President Arif Alvi had nominated Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) to chair the session.
64 senators stood up in support of the motion to table the no-confidence resolution when Barrister Saif directed senators, who were in favour of the resolution, to stand on their seats.
The opposition nominated Javed Abbasi while members supporting Sanjrani nominated Noman Wazir as their polling agents.
The total number of Senate seats is 104. There are currently 103 senators as Ishaq Dar of the PML-N is yet to take oath. 
After disqualification of former premier Nawaz Sharif, 13 senators were elected as independent candidates, including Mushahid Hussain Syed, Sabir Shah, Mehmood-ul-Hasan, Rana Maqbool, Asad Ashraf, Asif Kirmani, Asad Junejo, Musadiq Malik, Shaheen Khalid Butt, Nizhat Sadiq, Kamran Micheal, Shameem Afridi and Hafiz Abdul Kareem.
The PTI has 14 senators, and its ally, the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) of which Sanjrani is a member, has eight. Seven senators from the erstwhile Fata are also with the ruling party. Its other allies include, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) with five senators and the Pakistan Muslim League-Functional (PML-F) and the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) with one senator each.
The PML-N has 30 senators, 17 of them were independents who had later joined the party. The PPP has 20, the NP has five, the JUI-F and the PkMAP have four each, the Jamaat-e-Islami has two and ANP has one.
Yesterday, Sanjrani refuted opposition’s demand of resigning from his post voluntarily and appears determined to fight till the end.
Sources familiar with the matter told the media that both, the government and the opposition were confident in line with their conscience.
PTI senator Shibli Faraz has asserted that the opposition’s attempt to de-seat Sanjrani would fail as the chairman would gain 60 votes in today’s balloting.
“Majority of the opposition members is not trusting Hasil Bizenjo [as the proposed leader of the upper House],” he said in his talk to the media.
Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhary took to Twitter today, and stated that it was an unfortunate that the no-confidence motion against chairman of the Senate was being held.
“This is a part of Abu Bachao campaign,” he said, adding that the premier and the government would remain unaffected by the motion; however the upper House of the parliament would be affected.
“Sadiq Sanjrani had maintained neutrality in the Senate, which would be influenced regardless of whosoever wins as the result of the no-trust motion,” he added.
The secretariat of the Senate sent a message to all the members detailing the procedure for voting under Rule 12(10) of the rules of procedure and conduct of business in the Senate, 2012.
It says that voting on the resolution(s) shall be secret and each member will have one vote only.
The members will not be allowed to carry mobile phones and cameras inside the polling booth. Disclosing the ballot paper or taking its photograph is strictly prohibited.
Rule 12(9) says the Senate shall not be adjourned until the motion for leave is disposed of or, if leave is granted, the resolution has been voted upon.
Rule 12(12) reads: “The Chairman or, as the case may be, Deputy Chairman, shall stand removed from his office on the resolution being passed by a majority of the total membership of the Senate.”
The presiding officer will announce the success or failure of no confidence move after counting. Voting on the move against Deputy Chairman Saleem Mandviwala would also follow the same procedure.
Yesterday, the Rehbar Committee of the joint opposition held meetings in Islamabad to finalise its strategy for the no-confidence motion against the sitting chairman.
Speaker National Assembly Asad Qaiser met Sadiq Sanjarani and expressed full support against opposition’s no confidence move. The leader of the house Shibli Faraz said the opposition’s demand for the resignation of Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani was “not a good tradition.”
Sanjarani passed his last day in his office and shifted all important files to his personal residence.
The leader of the opposition in the Senate Raja Zafar-ul-Haq and National Party’s (NP) Hasil Bizenjo addressed a luncheon hosted by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
Bilawal said it would be wise for the Senate chairman to resign before the vote so he could save himself from the embarrassment.
“He will be sent packing tomorrow in any case. We have enough numbers to de-seat him,” he added.
The opposition took the decision to remove the chairman of the upper house at a multi-party conference on June 26. The move is meant to be the first step towards mounting pressure on the PTI-led coalition government.
On July 9, the opposition parties submitted a resolution signed by 38 senators to the secretary of the Senate.
On last Tuesday, a Senate’s session was postponed after a short resumption as demanded by the opposition. Raja Zafarul Haq stated that the voting on a no-confidence motion filed against Sanjrani would be held on August 1. He demanded delay in the proceedings of the upper House due to voting on August 1.
Sanjrani had said that no-confidence motion against the chairman Senate could not be moved in the requisition session of the Senate and it can only be held in a regular session summoned by president.

Beauty of Izmis Lake attracts tourists from across country,"
SWAT (Web Desk) – Beautiful Izmis Lake is located to the south-west of Utror valley in Swat district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at an altitude of 11,550 feet above sea level.
The name Izmis means caves in Kohistani and as the lake is surrounded by several natural caves, the people have named the lake after these caves. A small jeep-able link road from Utror leads towards the location of the lake which ends in a valley called Loypanrghalay.
The lake can be accessed from here after trekking for almost two hours. The track meanders between sprawling and lush green carpets of grass covered with flowers of different colours and hues.
The grazing cows, lambs and goats make the panoramas more exciting and beautiful. A small hamlet called Kalam Banda is located on these eye-soothing highlands where the grazers welcome everyone in their own special rustic style.
The grazers who go to the pastures mostly belong to Utror valley. The signs of technological advancement can be observed here as the grazers have built a Hydro Power Plant to avail the water and electricity in these awesome heights. The lake lies almost at a distance of one hour from this heavenly locale.
The Lake is surrounded by towering mountains covered with green grasses and herbaceous plants which attract several grazers from the plains in summer.



The eastern and western faces of the lake are open with wide gullies at both ends. The grazers have constructed small stone and earthen structures in the peripheries of the lake which provides the temporary residence during summers.
It also serves as a watershed for a small stream which mingles with River Swat in Utror. The watershed areas of the lake have turned to peat-land/marshes and are an excellent feeding ground for the migratory birds as well as local bird and animal species.
According to the grazers several species of aquatic birds visits the area and feed in the marshes but the local poachers’ poses a grave threat to the survival of these endangered species of birds as they regularly visit the area and ruthlessly hunt-down these birds.



Izmis is a huge lake with shallow depth and little water. Most of the water which feeds the lake comes from the surrounding glaciers and small springs.
Izmis lake shows clear signs of ecological decline which if not timely tackled will result in the extinction of this important source of fresh drinking and irrigation water; and will destroy an important temporary and vital residing ground for the migratory birds.
The lake needs urgent attention from environmentalist due to the natural and human-made threats; otherwise this important lake will become a fragment in the unending annals of history.

US renews waivers for Iran civil nuclear projects,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States said Wednesday it was extending waivers for three civilian nuclear projects in Iran, despite Washington’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement.
""This is a short 90 day extension,"" said White House National Security Advisor John Bolton, a champion of the hawkish policy towards Tehran.
""We are watching those nuclear activities very, very closely, they remain under daily scrutiny,"" he told Fox Business.
The projects include the Bushehr nuclear power plant, the Arak heavy water reactor, which has been modified under the supervision of the international community to render it impossible to produce plutonium for military use, and the Fordow fuel enrichment plant.
The State Department downplayed the move, as it did when it last granted an extension in May, describing the waivers as ""continued restrictions on the Iranian regime’s nuclear program"".
""The action today will help preserve oversight of Iran’s civil nuclear program, reduce proliferation risks, constrain Iran’s ability to shorten its ‘breakout time’ to a nuclear weapon, and prevent the regime from reconstituting sites for proliferation-sensitive purposes,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.
In reality, the move extends exemptions for the three Iranian civil nuclear projects, the State Department confirmed to AFP.
There was debate in President Donald Trump’s administration about these exemptions, with hawks saying that after Washington’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, it would have been logical to stop them in order to further increase the pressure on Tehran.
But the more moderate line has prevailed for the moment, so as not to upset the other signatories to the 2015 deal -- China, Russia, Germany, France and Britain -- amid escalating tensions between the US and Iran.
The 2015 agreement promised that world powers would assist Iran in developing civilian nuclear energy -- the clerical regime’s stated goal for its atomic program.
The waiver announcement came as Washington imposed sanctions Wednesday on Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-01-19/news_big_images/503196_66626954.jpg,world,"

Germany nixes US request to join naval mission off Iran,"
BERLIN (AFP) - Germany poured cold water Wednesday on a US demand it join a maritime surveillance mission in the Strait of Hormuz, arguing that it wants to focus on diplomacy to ease tensions with Iran.
Chancellor Angela Merkel s government was responding to a US demand made public a day earlier ""to help secure"" the world s busiest oil shipping lane and ""combat Iranian aggression"".
Merkel s spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer said Germany was ""reluctant"" to join such a US-led mission and had ""not offered a contribution, as the overall approach of our policy toward Iran differs significantly from the current US approach"".
Berlin was seeking an emphasis on ""diplomacy and de-escalation"", she said, as it also tries to save the Iran nuclear deal from which President Donald Trump withdrew last year.
Demmer said that ""participation in a US-led mission could complicate this issue, even as of course we share the goal of freedom of navigation"".
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas was even more direct, reflecting the position of his centre-left Social Democrats, who are junior coalition partners to Merkel s conservatives.

Al-Qaeda heir Hamza bin Laden killed: US media,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - Osama bin Laden’s son Hamza, chosen heir to the leadership of Al-Qaeda, has been killed, US media reported Wednesday citing American officials.
NBC News said three US officials had confirmed they had information of Hamza bin Laden’s death, but gave no details of the place or date.
The New York Times subsequently cited two US officials saying they had confirmation that he was killed during the last two years in an operation that involved the United States.
Questioned by reporters in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump did not confirm or deny the NBC report.
""I don’t want to comment on it,"" he said.
Both reports suggested that bin Laden may have been killed well before the US State Department announced a $1 million bounty on his head in February 2019.
The 15th of Osama bin Laden’s 20 children and a son of his third wife, Hamza, thought to be about 30 years old, was ""emerging as a leader in the Al-Qaeda franchise,"" the State Department said in announcing the reward.
Sometimes dubbed the ""crown prince of jihad, he had put out audio and video messages calling for attacks on the United States and other countries, especially to avenge his father’s killing by US forces in Pakistan in May 2011, the department said.
Documents seized in the raid on his father’s house in Abbottabad suggested Hamza was being groomed as heir to the Al-Qaeda leadership.
US forces also found a video of the wedding of Hamza to the daughter of another senior Al-Qaeda official that is believed to have taken place in Iran.
Hamza bin Laden’s whereabouts have never been pinpointed. He was believed to have been under house arrest in Iran but reports suggest he also may have resided in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria.
The group behind the deadly September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, Al-Qaeda’s prominence as a radical group has faded over the past decade in the shadow.
But the proliferation of branches and associated jihadist groups in Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria and elsewhere have underscored its continuing potency.

Groomed to lead

Hamza bin Laden was not targeted just because he was bin Laden’s son, said Rita Katz, executive director of the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks extremists.
""He was one of Al-Qaeda’s loudest voices calling for attacks in the West and giving directives. He, with Al-Qaeda’s help, was positioning himself to lead the global jihadi movement,"" Katz said on Twitter.
""He was seen as a future leader who would unite the global jihad. Thus, if he is indeed dead, it will be a major blow to the movement,"" she said.
""I think it’s a big loss for Al-Qaeda,"" said Pakistani security expert Rahimullah Yusufzai, one the few journalists to have interviewed Osama bin Laden face to face.
At his father’s side in Afghanistan before the 9/11 attacks, Hamza learnt how to handle weapons, and ranted in his thin voice against Americans, Jews and ""Crusaders"" in videos uploaded online.
In 2016 Al-Qaeda released a video message in which he urged Islamic State and other jihadists in Syria to unite, claiming that the fight in the war-torn country paves the way to ""liberating Palestine.""
""There is no longer an excuse for those who insist on division and disputes now that the whole world has mobilised against Muslims,"" he said.
In a later message that year he called on Saudi youth to overthrow the kingdom’s rulers, telling them to enlist in the Yemen-based Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to gain battlefield experience.
In 2017 he was placed on the US terrorist blacklist, seen as a potent future figurehead for the group then led by Osama bin Laden’s former deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-01-19/news_big_images/503137_62491378.jpg,world,US forces also found a video of the wedding of Hamza to the daughter of another senior Al-Qaeda official that is believed to have taken place in Iran.,neutral
UN Security Council to discuss N. Korea missile tests,"
UNITED NATIONS (AFP) - The United Nations Security Council will meet behind closed doors on Thursday to discuss North Korea s recent ballistic missiles tests, diplomats said.
Britain, France and Germany requested the discussion amid growing concern that Pyongyang is developing long-range weapons in violation of UN Security Council resolutions.
North Korea fired two ballistic missiles on Wednesday, Seoul said, days after a similar launch that the nuclear-armed North described as a warning to the South over planned joint military drills with the United States.
The North is banned from ballistic missile launches under UN Security Council resolutions but it was the second in less than a week, despite a meeting between leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump last month.
Pyongyang and Washington are engaged in a long-running diplomatic process over the North s nuclear and missile programs that has seen three high-profile encounters between their leaders in the space of a year.
They agreed to resume talks during their impromptu June encounter in the Demilitarized Zone that divides the peninsula, but that working-level dialogue has yet to begin.
""We ll be having consultations on North Korea on Thursday morning. We re going to discuss the latest missile launches that are violations of Security Council resolutions,"" a source told AFP.
A separate source said the discussions would form part of any other business, the last item on the agenda of a closed doors meeting being held to mark the first day of Poland s presidency of the Security Council.

"Boris Johnson visits N. Ireland, heart of Brexit battle","
BELFAST (AFP) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday visited Northern Ireland, the key battleground in Brexit and the focus of increasingly tense rhetoric on both sides of the Irish Sea.
He arrived in Belfast on Tuesday amid warnings from Irish leaders that his vow to leave the European Union, with or without a deal, risks breaking up the United Kingdom.
Those warnings continued on Wednesday.
But during meetings with the province s main political parties he reiterated his determination to split with the EU.
""The Prime Minister made clear that the UK would be leaving the EU on October 31st come what may,"" a Downing Street spokesperson said.
After meeting Johnson, Mary Lou McDonald, the head of Republican Sinn Fein party, said he had ""set the compass for a disorderly and a crash Brexit,"" meaning that there had now to be the opportunity for Northern Ireland to consider joining the Republic.
""We ve made it clear to him that the extensive planning that he tells us he is carrying out in respect of a crash Brexit has to include the constitutional question,"" she told the BBC.
The Republic of Ireland shares a land border with the province that both sides want to keep free-flowing after Brexit, both for economic reasons and to maintain the delicate peace deal that brought an end to decades of violence between the pro-Irish and pro-British communities.
But post-Brexit, that border will become part of the EU s external frontier and would legally require policing.
The agreement struck by Johnson s predecessor Theresa May proposed the so-called ""backstop"" solution after Brexit.
But eurosceptics believe it gives the EU too much control over the UK and risks constitutionally distancing Northern Ireland from Britain.
If a trade deal cannot be agreed by the end of 2020, under the backstop the UK would remain aligned with the EU customs union, while Northern Ireland would additionally stay aligned to some European single market rules, in order to keep the Irish border free-flowing.
Neither London nor Brussels can end the arrangement unilaterally.
On Tuesday, Johnson told Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar that the ""backstop"" plan was unacceptable, putting him at odds with both Dublin and Brussels, which insist the deal is not open for renegotiation.
""If they really can t do it then clearly we have to get ready for a no-deal exit,"" Johnson said on a trip to Wales, adding: ""It s up to the EU: this is their call.""
Varadkar has said previously that Johnson s plan to renegotiate the deal by October 31 was ""totally not in the real world"".
Leaving without a deal would throw the border status into confusion and threaten economic catastrophe for Ireland, cutting it off from its UK main trading partner.
Varadkar said on Friday that a no-deal Brexit would make the unification of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland more likely.
""People who you might describe as moderate nationalists or moderate Catholics who were more or less happy with the status quo will look more towards a united Ireland,"" he said.
Northern Ireland is not the only part of the United Kingdom whose status after Brexit is under the spotlight.
Johnson visited Scotland on Monday, where First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said last week that Scotland needed an ""alternative option"" to his Brexit strategy.
In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford told him that Brexit would be ""catastrophic"" and to ""stop playing fast and loose with our country"".

"North Korea launches 2 short-range missiles, Seoul says","
SEOUL (AP) — South Korea s military said North Korea conducted its second weapons test in less than a week Wednesday, firing two short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast in a move observers said could be aimed at boosting pressure on the United States as the rivals struggle to set up fresh nuclear talks.
South Korea s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the missiles were launched from Wonsan, a city the North pushes as a vacation destination but that it also uses as a regular launch site.
It said both missiles were believed to have flown about 250 kilometers (155 miles) at a maximum altitude of 30 kilometers (19 miles), and that the South Korean and U.S. militaries were trying to gather more details.
The test, which would be yet another North Korean violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, comes as the country s negotiations with the U.S. over its nuclear weapons program are at a stalemate and as Pyongyang has expressed anger over planned U.S.-South Korean military drills.
""The North s repeated missile launches are not helpful to efforts to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula, and we urge (North Korea) to stop this kind of behavior,"" the South Korean statement said.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters that the launches were ""no threat to Japanese national security.""
Last Thursday, North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles that Seoul officials said flew 600 kilometers (370 miles) and as high as 50 kilometers (30 miles) before landing in the sea.
North Korea s state media said those tests were supervised by leader Kim Jong Un and were designed to deliver a ""solemn warning"" to South Korea over its purchase of high-tech U.S.-made fighter jets and the planned military drills, which Pyongyang calls an invasion rehearsal.
Even though North Korea is banned by the U.N. from using ballistic technology in any weapons launches, it s unlikely that the nation, already under 11 rounds of U.N. sanctions, will be hit with more punitive measures. Past sanctions were imposed only when the North conducted long-range ballistic launches.
Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya told reporters Wednesday that the most recently launched weapons did not reach Japan s exclusive economic zone and that officials were still analyzing details, including the flight distance and trajectory.
""It is extremely regrettable that North Korea continues firing the missiles that violate the U.N. resolutions,"" Iwaya said.
Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman from the Chinese foreign ministry, said that China noted the launches and the responses of all sides, and that the ""political settlement on the (Korean) Peninsula is currently in a critical stage."" China is North Korea s most important economic and diplomatic ally.
""We hope that all parties concerned will cherish the hard-won alleviations and jointly make positive efforts to promote denuclearization and realize lasting peace on the peninsula and in the region,"" Hua told reporters at a daily news briefing.
Observers say a low altitude flight by the missiles indicate North Korea may have been testing their ability to avoid being intercepted.
Earlier last week, Kim visited a newly built submarine and expressed his satisfaction with its weapons system. North Korea said its deployment was ""near at hand.""
In a private briefing to lawmakers Wednesday, South Korean military intelligence officers said they ve determined that the submarine likely has three launch tubes for missiles, according to Lee Hye-hoon, head of parliament s intelligence committee. If confirmed, it would be North Korea s first operational submarine with missile launch tubes, some experts said.
North Korea acquiring the ability to launch missiles from submarines would be an alarming development because such missiles are harder to detect in advance. Experts say the submarine North Korea used to test-fire missiles in recent years should be regarded as a test platform with a single launch tube. They say other North Korean submarines only have torpedo launch tubes.
Wednesday s launches came hours after a senior U.S. official said President Donald Trump sent Kim mementos from his brief visit to an inter-Korean border town late last month.
The official said a top staffer from the National Security Council hand-delivered photographs from the leaders  June meeting at the Korean Demilitarized Zone to a North Korean official last week. The Trump administration official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official wasn t authorized to speak publicly.
The DMZ meeting was the third summit between Trump and Kim. At their second meeting, in Vietnam in February, Trump rejected Kim s demand for widespread sanctions relief in return for dismantling the North s main nuclear complex, a partial disarmament step.
During the DMZ meeting, Trump and Kim agreed to resume nuclear diplomacy in coming weeks, but there hasn t been any known meeting between the countries.
Speaking to reporters accompanying him to an Asian security forum in Thailand, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he s ""very hopeful"" for a quick resumption in the nuclear talks.
Despite a recent lack of progress in nuclear diplomacy, both Trump and Kim have said they have maintained good relations with each other. After last Thursday s missile launches, Trump tried to downplay the significance of the tests, saying that ""short-range"" was the most important detail. He said North Korea fired ""standard"" missiles that many countries possess.
South Korea s military said the flight data of the weapon launched last week showed similarities to the Russian-made Iskander, a short-range, nuclear-capable missile. A North Korean version could likely reach all of South Korea — and the 28,500 U.S. forces stationed there — and would be extremely hard to intercept.
Before last week s launches, North Korea last fired missiles into the sea in early May, and experts said those were also Iskander-like missiles. During Wednesday s briefing, the South Korean military intelligence officers said that an analysis of North Korea-dispatched photos showed that the North fired four missiles on two days, according to Lee, the lawmaker. South Korea earlier said the North fired a total of three missiles at the time.
After entering talks with Washington, North Korea has suspended nuclear and long-range missile tests, and Trump has said that is proof that his North Korea policy is working well and has eased the danger of a war with the North.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-31-19/news_big_images/503067_81771045.jpg,world,"

Bangladesh grapples with country's worst dengue outbreak,"
DHAKA (AP) — Bangladesh is facing its worst-ever dengue fever outbreak as hospitals are flooded with patients, putting a severe strain on the country s already overwhelmed medical system.
The mosquito-borne viral infection has spread across the country, with 61 out of 64 districts reporting dengue cases by late Tuesday.
The government has confirmed 15,369 dengue cases since Jan. 1. Of those, 9,683 patients were diagnosed between July 1 and July 30. As of Tuesday, about 4,400 patients, including many children, were undergoing hospital treatment. There have been 14 deaths.
Officials from Dhaka, the overcrowded capital and the epicenter of the outbreak, have struggled to contain it, drawing criticism and spreading panic among some residents.
Dengue is found in tropical areas around the world and is spread by a type of mosquito that mainly lives in urban areas. The virus causes severe flu-like symptoms, and while there is no specific treatment for the illness, medical care to maintain a person s fluid levels is seen as critical.
There are fears that the situation in the countryside will worsen as many residents of the city travel to villages to celebrate Eid-ul-Adha next month. Infected humans can serve as a source of the virus for uninfected mosquitoes.
Ayesha Akhter, assistant director at the Directorate General of Health Services under the Ministry of Health, said an outbreak of dengue has accompanied every monsoon since 2000, but this year s situation is the worst.
A DGHS study identified a six-fold increase in the Aedes aegypti mosquito population in four months in Dhaka as the primary cause of the larger-than-average outbreak.
Earlier this month, the World Health Organization said the dengue situation in Bangladesh was ""alarming but not out of control.""
Other countries in Asia are also facing a surge in dengue cases this year, including Thailand, where 53,699 cases and 65 deaths were reported as of July 23.
Nevertheless, with dengue cases soaring in recent weeks, Dhaka hospitals have been running out of room and manpower to treat new patients.
Prof. Abul Kalam Azad, director general of DGHS, said they had asked the hospitals to increase beds for dengue patients and to open dengue wards. The government also halved the charges for diagnosing dengue and directed public and private hospitals, clinics and diagnostic centers to do the same.
Dhaka Medical College Hospital, the largest hospital in the country, opened a special ward for dengue patients, said A.K.M. Nasir Uddin, its director general.
Prof. Uttam Kumar Barua, director of Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, another major public hospital in Dhaka, said they were relying on senior medical students to assist doctors in the face of so many patients.
""We don t have manpower, logistic support and technicians as much as needed. That s why we are having too much pressure. We have three times more patients than our bed capacity,"" Barua said.
He said they were admitting every dengue patient who entered the hospital but could not provide beds or even seats for everyone, adding that many had been asked to wait in hospital corridors and verandas.
Champa Begum took her 8-month-old to Shaheed hospital on Wednesday.
""I have other kids. I go to work leaving this one to another child. I have no way but to work,"" she said. ""I can t take care of this child properly. This child is laid down anywhere. My home is above dirty water. That how this one was bitten and got dengue.""
On Tuesday, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called for concerted efforts to fight the illness.
""The government is working to tackle dengue,"" she told an emergency meeting of her ruling Awami League party via teleconference from London, where she was on an official visit.
""I urge everyone to keep their houses and surrounding areas clean. That will save us from the disease,"" she said.

Iran says it's prepared for dialogue if Saudi Arabia also ready,"
GENEVA (Reuters) - Iran is prepared for dialogue if Saudi Arabia is also ready, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Wednesday, according to the IRIB news agency.
Tensions have spiked between Iran and Saudi Arabia, arch-rivals for predominance in the Middle East, since Riyadh accused the Islamic Republic of carrying out attacks that damaged six oil tankers in the Gulf, an allegation Tehran has denied.
""If Saudi Arabia is ready for dialogue, we are always ready for dialogue with our neighbours,"" Zarif said. ""We have never closed the door to dialogue with our neighbours and we will never close the door to dialogue with our neighbours.""
The attacks on the oil tankers came as the United States, Saudi Arabia s major big power ally, toughened sanctions on Iran in a bid to force it into negotiations on stricter limits to its nuclear activity and curbs on its ballistic missile programme.
Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, called in mid-June on the international community to take a “decisive stand” over the tanker attacks but said the kingdom did not want a war in the region.
Zarif also said Iran could hold similar talks with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a close ally of the Saudis, adding, ""If they change their policies it is a very good opportunity for dialogue"".

"Afghanistan names team to talk to Taliban, expecting swift US deal to leave","
KABUL (Reuters) - The Afghan government named a team on Wednesday to negotiate directly with the Taliban, in the expectation that Washington was on the cusp of agreeing to withdraw troops after 18 years of war, meeting the insurgents  precondition for talks with Kabul.
The U.S. special representative for Afghanistan peace talks, Zalmay Khalilzad, tweeted that he was on his way to negotiation venue Qatar, ready to close a deal to end the war that began in 2001 after the September 11 attacks on the United States.
""I m off to Doha, with a stop in Islamabad. In Doha, if the Taliban do their part, we will do ours, and conclude the agreement we have been working on,"" Khalilzad said.
Suhail Shaheen, a spokesman for Taliban s political office in Doha said: ""We have completed consultations with our leaders regarding the talks with the U.S, now we are ready and waiting for him (Khalilzad) to restart the talks.""
Khalilzad, an Afghan-born veteran American diplomat, was appointed last year to negotiate a political settlement with the Taliban, who now control more territory than at any point since the United States bombed them out of power in 2001.
They have said they will not talk with the Afghan government about the future of the country until Washington agrees to withdraw its troops.
Khalilzad has been in Kabul, where he met President Ashraf Ghani, top security officials, senior opposition leaders, diplomats and civil society members to discuss the peace process before striking a deal with the Taliban.
""Wrapping up my most productive visit to Afghanistan since I took this job as Special Rep. The U.S. and Afghanistan have agreed on next steps,"" he said on Twitter.
Two sources with knowledge of the talks said they could conclude with an agreement on the withdrawal of foreign forces in exchange for security guarantees by the Taliban.
Afghanistan s ministry of peace appointed a 15-member delegation on Wednesday to negotiate with the Taliban. An official at the ministry said Norway could be the venue for intra-Afghan talks.
About 20,000 foreign troops, most of them American, are now in Afghanistan as part of a U.S.-led NATO mission to train, assist and advise Afghan forces. Some U.S. forces carry out counter-terrorism operations. President Donald Trump has announced his aim to end the war.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said some senior members of its negotiating team were traveling to the Indonesian capital Jakarta, and talks with U.S. officials would resume after they returned to Doha. ""I can t say when the talks with the United States will start,"" he said.
 

FEARS

Many Afghans fear a U.S. troop withdrawal announcement will weaken their bargaining power with the hardline Islamist group, which aims to re-establish an Islamic emirate to replace an elected government it dismisses as puppets of foreign forces.
Women s rights groups in particular worry about the fate of women and girls in the event of a return of the Taliban, who banned girls  education and imposed severe restrictions on women s rights to work outside the home.
Last week the Taliban said talks with the Afghan government would come only after a deal had been struck with the United States on the departure of its forces.
At the peak of the conflict nearly a decade ago, the United States had 100,000 troops in Afghanistan leading a 130,000-strong international force to prevent the Taliban from returning to power. More than 3,400 foreign troops died there, including more than 2,300 Americans.
The United Nations has tallied the deaths of more than 33,000 civilians in the war since 2009, including 1,300 in the first six months of this year.

Indian coffee king's body found,"
BANGALORE (AFP) - The body of billionaire Indian coffee magnate V.G. Siddhartha was found by a river in southern India on Wednesday, a day after a letter revealed his concerns over deep financial problems and perceived harassment from tax authorities.
The discovery by fishermen ended a two-day search for the founder of the Cafe Coffee Day empire, after he was last seen by his driver walking across a bridge in the city of Mangalaru.
Politicians and business figures called immediately for a probe into Siddhartha’s death, as well as the allegations in his letter of harassment from lenders and tax authorities.
""The government should hold a proper investigation into his tragic death,"" former prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda said on Twitter as he expressed ""shock"".
A call for an independent inquiry was raised in parliament by opposition Congress MP Manish Tewari.
Siddhartha -- whose family had been in the coffee business for 130 years -- opened his first Cafe Coffee Day store in 1996 and went on to become one of the world’s biggest coffee traders.
He owned Asia’s biggest coffee plantation and his company was India’s biggest coffee exporter.
The chain has more than 1,700 stores, mainly in India, but also in Malaysia, Egypt, Czech Republic and Austria, employing more than 30,000 people.
Its shares slumped by 20 percent for the second straight day on Wednesday as news of the body was released.

‘Unbearable stress’ 


Police said Siddhartha, aged about 59, left Bangalore late Monday, telling his family he was going to a hill resort but instead asked his driver to take him to Mangaluru.
He ordered the driver to stop the car and started walking along a bridge as he talked to someone on his phone before disappearing, according to police.
Fishermen finally found his body early Wednesday on a river bank, according to police.
Siddhartha’s empire came under increasing pressure after tax authorities launched raids on company offices in 2017.
In a letter to the Cafe Coffee Day board, the 57-year-old chairman had admitted mistakes in handling his financial affairs.
But he said he had suffered pressure from lenders and Indian tax authorities.
""I am very sorry to let down all the people that put their trust in me,"" said the letter, which was released by the company as it held an emergency board meeting on Tuesday.
""I fought for a long time but today I have given up as I could not take any more pressure from one of the private equity partners forcing me to buy back shares.""
Siddhartha said he had faced ""a lot of harassment"" from the Indian tax authorities.
""My intention was never to cheat or mislead anybody, I have failed as an entrepreneur,"" he said.
Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, head of Biocon, one of Asia’s leading bio-pharmaceutical companies, said Siddhartha appeared to be under ""unbearable stress"" and the circumstances should be investigated. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-31-19/news_big_images/503009_45518366.jpg,world,"""I am very sorry to let down all the people that put their trust in me,"" said the letter, which was released by the company as it held an emergency board meeting on Tuesday.",neutral
"Top diplomats from S. Korea, Japan to hold talks: Seoul","
SEOUL (AFP) - The foreign ministers of South Korea and Japan will meet this week, Seoul said Wednesday, as a long-running diplomatic row develops into a bitter trade spat between the two US allies.
Japan this month unveiled tough restrictions on exports of chemicals vital to Seoul’s world-leading chip and smartphone industry, in an escalation of a decades-long dispute over Japanese forced labour during World War II.
Tokyo has also threatened to remove South Korea from its ""white list"" trade status as early as Friday, in a move that could affect hundreds of key items imported to the South.
Seoul’s foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha is due to meet her Japanese counterpart Taro Kono on Thursday in Bangkok on the sidelines of a regional foreign ministers’ meeting, the South’s foreign ministry said.
It did not elaborate on what will be discussed at the talks, which will be their first since Japan’s announcement.
Tokyo’s latest move has enraged South Koreans, where almost seven in 10 people still report negative feelings towards the country’s former colonial ruler.
South Koreans have launched a nationwide boycott of Japanese products ranging from beer and clothes to cosmetics, and the country’s top two air carriers - Korean Air and Asiana - have announced cuts in flights to Japan due to falling in demand.
Japan and South Korea are both democracies, market economies and US allies, but their relationship has been strained for decades as a result of Tokyo’s brutal 1910-45 colonial rule over the Korean peninsula.
Ties have worsened since last year following a series of rulings from South Korean courts ordering Japanese firms that used wartime forced labour to compensate victims.
Tokyo argues that compensation claims related to the issue were settled by the treaty that normalised relations in 1965, which included a reparations package of grants and cheap loans. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-31-19/news_big_images/502993_32647159.jpg,world,"

Trump suggests Baltimore 'worse than Honduras',"

""If you look at it statistically, it’s like, the number of shootings, the number of crimes, the number of everything - this morning I heard a statistic, Baltimore is worse than Honduras, okay?""
Trump provoked accusations of racism when he lashed out at the majority black, Democratic-led city on Sunday by attacking prominent African-American lawmaker Elijah Cummings, whose district covers much of Baltimore.
According to FBI data from 2017, the latest full-year figures available, Baltimore had a per capita murder rate of 55.8 per 100,000 population, which was less than that of St Louis, Missouri.
Baltimore, near Washington, has slightly more than 600,000 residents.
Honduras, a country of more than nine million, registered 41.2 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2018, with one of its cities, San Pedro Sula, named as among the world’s most violent cities in a report last November by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).
San Pedro Sula had a murder rate of more than 80 per 100,000, the report said. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-31-19/news_big_images/502971_32583434.jpg,world,"

"Afghanistan highway blast kills at least 34 on bus, injures 17","
KABUL (Reuters) - An explosion on Wednesday hit a bus traveling on a highway between two key cities in western Afghanistan, killing at least 34 passengers, including children, and injuring 17, officials said.

Security has been deteriorating across Afghanistan, with the Taliban and Islamic State fighters mounting near-daily attacks on Afghan forces, government employees and civilians.

The blast on the highway linking the provincial capitals of Herat and Kandahar took place in the Ab Khorma area of Farah province, said provincial police spokesman Mohibullah Mohib.

“The bomb was freshly planted by the Taliban insurgents to target Afghan and foreign security forces,” he said.

Taliban officials were not immediately available to comment on the statement and there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.

Government and aid officials say the numbers of those being killed and maimed is rising because of explosives newly planted by the Taliban, who now control more territory than at any point since their ouster nearly 18 years ago.

Outraged Hong Kong's civil servants voice rare dissent,"
HONG KONG (AFP) - Growing ranks of Hong Kong’s typically conservative and publicity-shy bureaucrats have begun an unprecedented online dissent campaign against the city’s pro-Beijing leaders over their response to weeks of violent pro-democracy protests.
Multiple open letters have been signed by hundreds of anonymous civil servants in the past week condemning the administration of city leader Carrie Lam and the police.
A group of civil servants have also announced plans to hold a rally on Friday night -- something unheard of from a demographic that usually eschews politics.
The letters -- accompanied by photos of civil servant identity cards with personal details obscured -- bemoan Lam’s lack of leadership and refusal to compromise as her administration grapples with huge protests rocking the international finance hub.
Civil servants interviewed by AFP said they felt compelled to speak out after nearly two months of chaos that shows no signs of abating, with Lam seemingly unable -- or unwilling -- to find a solution and Beijing continuing to back her government.
Many decided to break their silence after a vicious attack on protesters by pro-government thugs and suspected triad members that left 45 people in hospital.
""I hope to use this letter to tell citizens that the people are our real bosses,"" a 30-year-old executive officer and anonymous signatory who only gave her surname Leung, told AFP.
""We need to use this special role of ours to make sure the government squarely faces and responds to issues.""

‘Speak up now’ 


An officer in her mid-twenties in the government’s food and environmental hygiene department said she planned to attend Friday’s rally because Lam’s administration had not shown ""a sliver of conscience"".
""If I don’t speak up now, I would be complicit in their abuses,"" she told AFP.
""The current government has lost its credibility and used the violence of the system and the police to suppress people’s voices and deprive them of their fundamental rights.""
The Hong Kong protests were triggered by a government proposal which would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, but have since evolved into a call for wider democratic reforms and a halt to sliding freedoms.
Beyond agreeing to suspend the extradition bill there have been few other concessions from Lam, who has kept a low profile and made few public appearances as clashes between police and protesters have escalated.
The protest movement already had broad support from within the city’s legal, religious and business communities.
But growing numbers of professional groups are now speaking out, from architects to flight attendants.
One of the letters published online focused on allegations that the police were too slow to respond to the suspected triad attacks and colluded with the assailants who were filmed leaving the scene unhindered.
""As part of the disciplinary forces, we are extremely ashamed. You have brought shame upon your own shoulders,"" read a statement by a group of firefighters and paramedics condemning police.

Extreme bullying


Chan, an employee in the government’s innovation and technology bureau who asked not to reveal his first name, said morale was low among his peers.
""It’s very hard not to speculate there’s a connection between police and triads,"" he said, adding the image of his profession had been ""seriously damaged"".
Police chiefs have forcefully denied allegations of collusion with triads, and said their officers were stretched thin by clashes with protests elsewhere that night.
Other letters penned by civil servants have taken aim at the government.
One described the authorities’ actions as ""extreme bullying and oppression"", while another threatened ""concrete industrial action, so that we could humbly join hands with the community at large"".
The food department officer, who has attended protests in recent weeks, said her colleagues have had little chance to discuss politics at work.
""Civil servants need to remain politically neutral when carrying out their duties,"" she said.
""But when we take off our uniforms after work and become Hong Kong citizens again... like everyone else we are anxious and angry towards this shameless government."" ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-31-19/news_big_images/502955_89341186.jpg,world,"Civil servants interviewed by AFP said they felt compelled to speak out after nearly two months of chaos that shows no signs of abating, with Lam seemingly unable -- or unwilling -- to find a solution and Beijing continuing to back her government.",neutral
"Macron, Rouhani hold talks over Iran-US tensions","
PARIS (AFP) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday spoke with his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani and reiterated his call for a de-escalation of tensions between Iran and the United States, the Elysee said.
""It is France s role to make every effort to ensure that all parties agree to a break and open negotiations,"" the French presidency said.
The 2015 deal over Iran s nuclear programme has begun to unravel since US President Donald Trump announced Washington was pulling out of the agreement last year and reimposed sanctions, to the dismay of European allies.
France, Britain and Germany were among the key players in the pact.
Macron had a ""long"" discussion with Rouhani during the French leader s annual holiday at his summer retreat, the medieval fort of Bregancon on France s Mediterranean coast, the Elysee said.
Macron ""recalled the need to initiate a de-escalation of tensions,"" it added.
Paris has engaged in intense diplomacy seeking to solve the current tensions, with Macron s foreign policy advisor Emmanuel Bonne twice visiting Tehran.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is due to visit Macron in Bregancon in mid-August ahead of a G7 summit in Biarritz which will present ""new opportunities to discuss the Iranian issue"", according to the Elysee.

US urges Germany to 'help secure' Strait of Hormuz,"
BERLIN (AFP) - The United States stepped up diplomatic pressure on Germany Tuesday to join efforts to secure the strategic Strait of Hormuz as tensions mount between Washington and Iran.
The request came after Britain last week ordered its navy to escort UK-flagged ships in the world s busiest oil shipping lane in response to Iranian soldiers seizing a tanker in the flashpoint entrance to the Gulf.
""We ve formally asked Germany to join France and the UK to help secure the Strait of Hormuz and combat Iranian aggression,"" said US embassy spokeswoman Tamara Sternberg-Greller in a statement.
""Members of the German government have been clear that freedom of navigation should be protected... Our question is, protected by whom?""
The US request is highly controversial in Germany, where many politicians fear any naval mission, especially one led by the US, could heighten the risk of conflict with Iran.
It comes at a time when US President Donald Trump regularly criticises Germany for what he considers its insufficient contribution to joint NATO defence.
Long-simmering tensions have spiked between Tehran and Washington since Trump unilaterally withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal last year and reimposed biting sanctions on the Islamic republic.
While other parties have since tried to salvage the accord, the US and Saudi Arabia have accused Iran of being behind multiple mysterious attacks on tankers in the Gulf in June, which Tehran denies.
Iran also shot down an unmanned US aircraft in June, after which Trump announced that he had called off retaliatory air strikes at the last minute because the resulting death toll would have been too high.
Since then a series of incidents involving oil tankers have heightened tensions.
Britain detained an Iranian tanker off its overseas territory of Gibraltar in early July for allegedly breaching EU sanctions on Syria.
In what many read as a tit-for-tat move, Iran s Revolutionary Guards two weeks later impounded a British-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz.
Britain last week proposed a European-led protection force there, but has since suggested such a mission should involve the United States.
France said last week it was not willing to send extra military assets to the Gulf, but would share information and coordinate its currently deployed assets.
A German foreign ministry source said that the US had ""recently presented its concept for a maritime surveillance mission ... to a number of allies, including Germany, and asked for contributions"".
""The German government has taken note of this, but not promised to make any contribution.""
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas had ""repeatedly stressed that, in our view, the priority must be to de-escalate tensions and continue with diplomatic efforts,"" said the ministry source.
""We are working closely with France and the United Kingdom on this. We can rule out participation in the American strategy of maximum pressure.""

Iran tanker captain says marines used 'brute force': BBC,"
MADRID (AFP) - The captain of an Iranian tanker seized in Gibraltar, provoking a diplomatic crisis between Tehran and London, has accused Royal Marines of unnecessary ""brute force"" when detaining the ship, the BBC reported Tuesday.
The supertanker was seized on July 4 by Gibraltar police and British special forces from the United Kingdom off the overseas British territory.
The ship was suspected of carrying oil to war-torn Syria in violation of EU sanctions.
In an interview with the BBC released Tuesday, the Indian captain, who asked to remain anonymous, said Royal Marines boarded the Grace 1 ship and made his unarmed crew kneel on deck at gunpoint.
In a statement, Britain s defence ministry said it ""was a standard boarding that was carried out in full compliance with international rules and norms"".
In the interview, the captain said that in the early hours of July 4, he was radioed a police request to board his ship and lowered his ladder.
But he said before anyone could board, a military helicopter landed on the ship and Royal Marines came on.
""They didn t care whether I was master...we had 28 unarmed crew. I was in a state of shock, everybody was in a state of shock,"" he was quoted as saying.
""How do you come on a ship like this with armed forces and such brute force. For what reason?,"" he asked. The marines could have simply boarded and told him he was under arrest, he added according to the BBC.
In a statement, police in Gibraltar said the military intervened to support them, ""applying the minimum use of force maxim"".
The Gibraltar government, meanwhile, said it had evidence contradicting the account of the captain, who has already been questioned.
It said it would make a fuller statement at a later stage ""setting out why the evidence now points even more clearly to the destination having been Baniyas,"" a Syrian refinery.
Iran has strongly condemned the seizure of the tanker.
In what London called a ""tit-for-tat"" move, Iran s Revolutionary Guards impounded a British-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz two weeks later.
The detention of the 330-metre (1,000-feet) Grace 1 comes at a sensitive time in Iran-EU relations. Iran has announced it will no longer respect some limits set on its nuclear programme as per a 2015 deal, in retaliation for US sanctions.

N. Korea fires two ballistic missiles: South,"
SEOUL (AFP) - Pyongyang fired two ballistic missiles on Wednesday, Seoul said, days after a similar launch that the nuclear-armed North described as a warning to the South over planned joint military drills with the United States.
The two devices were fired from the Wonsan area on the east coast at dawn and flew around 250 kilometres (155 miles), said South Korea s Joint Chiefs of Staff.
""We stress a series of missile launches do not help ease tensions in the Korean Peninsula and urge the North to refrain from such acts,"" they said in a statement.
The North is banned from ballistic missile launches under UN Security Council resolutions but it was the second such firing in less than a week, despite a meeting between leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump last month.
Pyongyang and Washington are engaged in a long-running diplomatic process over the North s nuclear and missile programmes that has seen three high-profile encounters between their leaders in the space of a year.
They agreed to resume talks during their impromptu June encounter in the Demilitarized Zone that divides the peninsula, but that working-level dialogue has yet to begin.
Pyongyang has warned the negotiations could be derailed by Washington and Seoul s refusal to scrap the annual manoeuvres between their forces.
The North has defied years of isolation and sanctions to develop its arsenal and has not given up any of its weapons, while proving itself adept at dragging out discussions.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that the talks were taking ""a little bit longer"" than expected to start.
There was no immediate comment from Pyongyang on the latest launch, but Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest in Washington said it was a warning to the two security allies to stop the exercises ""or we will continue to show off our own offensive military capabilities and raise tensions to a slow boil over time"".
The North will carry out more launches before the drills begin next week and again afterwards, he predicted.
""The only question is: would the Kim regime dare test an ICBM, or a long-range missile, that could hit the US homeland?""
Pyongyang said last Thursday s launches were of newly designed ""tactical guided weapons"" that were a ""solemn warning to the South Korean warmongers"" over the planned military drills with the US.
Washington stations nearly 30,000 troops in the South to defend it from its neighbour, which invaded in 1950.
The devices were widely described as ballistic missiles, including by the US-South Korean Combined Forces Command and the government in Seoul.
But Trump -- who has repeatedly touted his relationship with Kim, whose regime is widely accused of human rights abuses -- brushed off the North s bellicose language, saying it was warning Seoul rather than Washington.
""He didn t send a warning to the United States,"" Trump said. ""They have their disputes, the two of them have their disputes.""
The Korea Times condemned what it called the US president s ""willful ignorance"" in an editorial Tuesday, before the latest launches.
Trump ""gives the impression that he doesn t mind its missile launches as long as they are short-range, and not threatening the US"", it said.
""Such a way of thinking is frustrating -- and dangerous,"" it added. ""Most of all, he can give the wrong signal to the North that the US will not step in as long as it does not target the US mainland. What about US allies in Asia?""

Revolut launches free share trading in Europe,"
WARSAW (Reuters) - Digital finance business Revolut is launching a fee-free share-trading service in the UK and Europe on Thursday, seeking a slice of the brokerage-controlled market to continue the company’s rapid expansion.
The UK-based fintech start-up has revolutionised currency exchange in Europe, offering cheap transactions to businesses and individual consumers. The company says it has 6 million customers in the UK and Europe and has signed up half a million in Poland in a little more than a year.
Poland has been one of Revolut’s key battlegrounds, prompting domestic banks in the country to lower their exchange rates.
“It’s just a start of development of our offer of fee-free investment services,” CEO Nik Storonski said in a statement, referring to the push into share trading in Europe, with Revolut also planning to offer the service outside the European Economic Area.
“We will be broadening it to further markets and additional products in the near future.”
Fee-free share trading will be limited to only a few transactions for clients who hold free Revolut accounts, while those who pay for Revolut’s premium account will be allowed to perform 100 transactions a month without charge.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-01-19/news_big_images/503189_69608735.jpg,business,"

In previous weeks, the local currency has depreciated massively despite receiving the first tranche of $991.4 million from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The stringent conditions – on which the global moneylender has formally approved the bailout package of $6 billion for Pakistan – seem to have exerted more pressure on the local currency.
The gradual drop in the rupee had come due to high demand for the dollar against thin supply as the country continued to make aggressive international payments to partially pay off huge foreign debt and for imports.
Economists are of the view that effective measures must be implemented on the priority basis to recover the state from the balance of payment deficit.
Besides increased demand of the greenback in the local market, they have termed ‘balance of payments deficit’ as the main reason in the recent hike in the value of the US dollar.
Moreover, they consider that state’s exports and investment are required to grow significantly, and the imports must be reduced to remove pressure on the local currency.

"U.S., China meet for trade talks as Trump talks tough","
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Top U.S. and Chinese trade officials met in Shanghai on Wednesday for talks in a bid to end a year-long trade war, despite low expectations for progress and combative remarks from U.S. President Donald Trump. 
As U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin landed in the Chinese commercial hub on Tuesday, Trump accused Beijing on Twitter of stalling, and warned of a worse outcome for China if it continued to do so.
This week’s meetings, the first in-person trade talks since a G20 truce last month, come as an official survey showed China’s factory activity shrank for the third month in a row in July, underlining the growing strains placed on the world’s second-biggest economy by the trade war.
Vice Premier Liu He met and shook hands with Lighthizer and Mnuchin at Shanghai’s Xijiao State Guest Hotel in front of media on Wednesday morning ahead of the day’s negotiations, but the officials did not make any public remarks.
The trade row has dragged on for more than a year, with the world’s two largest economies slapping billions of dollars of tariffs on each other’s imports, disrupting global supply chains and shaking financial markets.
The Shanghai talks were expected to center on “goodwill” gestures, such as Chinese commitments to purchase U.S. agricultural commodities and steps by the United States to ease some sanctions on Chinese telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, a person familiar with the discussions told Reuters earlier.
Trump had said on Twitter that China appeared to be backing off on a pledge to buy U.S. farm goods, and he warned that if China stalled in the hope that he wouldn’t win re-election in the November 2020 U.S. presidential contest, the outcome will be worse for China.
“The problem with them waiting ... is that if & when I win, the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating now ... or no deal at all,” Trump said.
China’s state-owned Global Times tabloid said that U.S. negotiators should show sincerity and hold “reasonable expectations” after making “unrealistic demands that infringe upon China’s sovereignty and dignity”.
It said that if “Washington still holds the illusion that Beijing will somehow cave in and compromise on issues concerning sovereignty and other related core interests to reach a deal, then no deal is fine”.
The U.S. and Chinese delegations were scheduled to have had dinner at Shanghai’s historic riverfront Fairmont Peace Hotel on Tuesday night, but both teams avoided the media and did not make public comments.
The U.S. Commerce Department put Huawei on a national security blacklist in May, effectively banning U.S. firms from selling to Huawei, a move that enraged Chinese officials.
Trump had agreed last month to allow some sales to Huawei in a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but so far, U.S. semiconductor and software makers are still mostly in the dark about the administration’s plans.
In Sao Paulo on Tuesday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said decisions on license applications by U.S. firms to resume some sales to Huawei could come as early as next week.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-31-19/news_big_images/502976_82522541.jpg,business,"

"ECC approves Rs1 billion subsidy to reduce roti, naan prices","
ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Taking notice of a news published by Dunya News, which outlined miseries of the general public due to rising inflation in the state, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet on Wednesday in Islamabad approved a subsidy of Rs1 billion to cut the price of naan and roti at Tandoors.
According to details, the ECC has decided to restore gas tariff as of June 30, 2019, for Tandoorwalas.
At present naan is selling at Rs12 to Rs15 in different cities of the country. However, before an increase in the gas tariff and rates of wheat flour, naan price ranged between Rs8 and Rs10. Similarly, roti is available at Rs10 to Rs12 while its previous rate was Rs7 to Rs8.
Importantly, for supporting local cotton growers, the committee has approved imposition of 10 percent tax on imported cotton.

Trade war keeps China's factories in reverse gear for third month,"
BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s factory activity shrank for the third month in a row in July, an official survey showed, underlining the growing strains on the world’s second-biggest economy as the Sino-U.S. trade war hits business profits, confidence and investment.
Wednesday’s weak manufacturing reading could fuel worries of a global recession and explains why policymakers around the world have stepped up easing measures, with some others considering doing so soon, to counter the fallout from international trade frictions.
The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 49.7 in July, China’s National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday, higher from the previous month of 49.4 but remains below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Analysts polled by Reuters predicted a reading of 49.6.
Deteriorating global demand left exporters struggling, with the survey showing export orders shrinking for the 14th month, though the sub-index ticked up fractionally to 46.9 from June’s 46.3. The contraction in total new orders also moderated slightly.
China’s factory output offered one brighter note, with growth quickening this month as the subindex rose to 52.1 from 51.3 in June.
The official gauge came on the second day of U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators’ meeting in Shanghai, their first in-person talks since a G20 truce last month.
Expectations for progress during the two-day meeting are low, so officials and businesses are hoping Washington and Beijing can at least detail commitments for “goodwill” gestures and clear the path for future negotiations.
In a row that has dragged on for more than a year, the world’s two largest economies have slapped billions of dollars of tariffs on each other’s imports, disrupting global supply chains and shaking financial markets. That has prompted central banks from India to Australia to South Africa to cut rates, with the U.S. Federal Reserve also widely expected to ease later on Wednesday for the first time since the global financial crisis.
The survey also showed persistent decline in orders from domestic customers, and even though demand conditions improved slightly it still remained worryingly weak despite a raft of recent stimulus measures.
Sluggish demand at home and abroad has led to a months-long spell of depressed activity for China’s manufacturers, and a sharp U.S. tariff hike announced in May threatens to crush already-thin profit margins.
Some manufactures have cut this year’s sales target as clients delay purchase orders in a wait-and-see approach, while others have already relocated their production capacity to neighboring countries to avoid the tariff hit.
The pressure on the manufacturing sector and weakening profits have prompted analysts’ warnings of a further period of stress for China before growth is expected to stabilize or recover.
So far, Beijing has relied on a combination of fiscal stimulus and monetary easing to weather the economic slowdown, including hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure spending and tax cuts for companies.
But the economy has been slow to respond, and business confidence remains shaky, weighing on investment.
Factories continued to cut jobs in July. The employment sub-index edged up to 47.1, compared with 46.9 in June.
China observers have said that Beijing’s recent growth-boosting measures will take time to filter through to the broader economy, and many analysts are of the view that further stimulus is needed to prevent a deeper downturn and to help stabilize growth.
A separate official business survey showed activity in China’s services sector grew at its slowest pace in 8 months in July, knocked by growing pressure on the broader economy from U.S. trade measures, with the official reading at 53.7 in July from 54.2 in June.
Beijing has been counting on a strong services sector to pick up the slack left by faltering trade as it tries to shift the economy away from a dependence on heavy industry and manufacturing exports.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-31-19/news_big_images/502951_16973968.jpg,business,"A separate official business survey showed activity in China’s services sector grew at its slowest pace in 8 months in July, knocked by growing pressure on the broader economy from U.S. trade measures, with the official reading at 53.7 in July from 54.2 in June.",neutral

Rupee further gains by 40 paisa against US dollar,"
KARACHI (Dunya News) – The Pakistani rupee on Tuesday further appreciated by 40 paisa against the US dollar to close at Rs160.05 in the interbank market.
In the open market, the local currency followed the similar trend and gained 30 paisa to close at Rs160.40 against the greenback.
Yesterday, the rupee appreciated by 13 paisa against the US dollar in the interbank market, and hit Rs160.45.
In the previous week, the Pakistani rupee depreciated by 39 paisa against the greenback and closed at Rs160.58 in the interbank market on Friday.
In the open market, the greenback with slight fluctuation in the whole previous week maintained its value around Rs160.70.
The rupee has been observed to cumulatively depreciate against the US dollar, which in turn has resulted in increased prices of goods and hardships for the general public.
Earlier, the SBP let the rupee depreciate significantly in the inter-bank market after finalising an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a loan programme on May 12.
The IMF has asked Pakistan to end state control of the rupee and let the currency move freely to find its equilibrium against the US dollar.
On the other hand, the World Bank Group has also supported the idea of leaving the rupee free from state control in an attempt to give much-needed boost to exports and fix a faltering economy.
In previous weeks, the local currency has depreciated massively despite receiving the first tranche of $991.4 million from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The stringent conditions – on which the global moneylender has formally approved the bailout package of $6 billion for Pakistan – seem to have exerted more pressure on the local currency.
The gradual drop in the rupee had come due to high demand for the dollar against thin supply as the country continued to make aggressive international payments to partially pay off huge foreign debt and for imports.
Economists are of the view that effective measures must be implemented on the priority basis to recover the state from the balance of payment deficit.
Besides increased demand of the greenback in the local market, they have termed ‘balance of payments deficit’ as the main reason in the recent hike in the value of the US dollar.
Moreover, they consider that state’s exports and investment are required to grow significantly, and the imports must be reduced to remove pressure on the local currency.
According to experts, the government must ensure implementations on economic policies after the deal with the IMF.
It is anticipated that the US dollar rate would fluctuate for some time, and the value of the Pakistani rupee would stabilise after proper implementation of the economic policies.

Buraq Taxi Service to be launched in six cities of Pakistan on August 10,"
(APP) – Eyeing on the potential transport market, a Chinese company is all set to launch its online taxi service on August 10 in six big cities of the country, inviting competition with two such services already operating in the market.
Timesaco, the company launching the Buraq Taxi Service, has devised a comprehensive strategy to attract customers towards its newly established service for making it competitive, since two taxi services namely Careem and Uber are already operating in the market.
Chinese company Timesaco intends to provide a rapid services platform to citizens by launching five special services including a taxi service, heavy cargo delivery, orders delivery, moving automated teller machines (ATM) and vehicle advertisement facilities, Timesaco Chief Operating Officer  Donald Li had said a few days ago.
Initially these instant services would be launched in the six major cities including Karachi, Lahore, Faisalabad, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Peshawar and would be extended to other urban centers as well, he had maintained.
Talking to APP, Li said that initially the taxi service would be offered at 10 percent discount rates for ride to education institution, health centers and marriage halls.
He said that special discount would also be provided to professionals including teachers, army personal and students.
He said that for Timesaco services, customers could download application from Google Play Store for instant services in all five major areas.
He said that people interested to work with Timesaco taxi services could register their vehicles with the company without any precondition.
Buraq drivers will get 97% share of their earring and company will get only 2% from drivers while one percent would be invested in Drivers’ Club for providing health and education services to families of drivers.
He said people could register their bikes, cars, rickshaws, pickups, qingqi loaders, and trucks with the company and get multiple ways for earning.
Talking about an elaborated programme of his company, he said that a comprehensive business plan had been worked out to provide five important services to citizens of Pakistan in six big cities, initially investing $20 million, with future prospects of $600 million.
The services would be provided in five special services in sectors including transportation, cargo, bank transaction and advertizing, Chief Operating Officer (CEO) Timesaco, Donald Li told APP in an exclusive interview.
Donald told APP that ‘Timesaco’ had already held its pre-launch event in Islamabad a week ago and introduced its Instant Services: taxi service ""Buraq"", instant delivery ""Fema"" and City Freight ""Cargo+"".
He said that modern technology and innovative methods of E-commerce would be utilized in delivering these services.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-30-19/news_big_images/502793_20204229.jpg,business,"Timesaco, the company launching the Buraq Taxi Service, has devised a comprehensive strategy to attract customers towards its newly established service for making it competitive, since two taxi services namely Careem and Uber are already operating in the market.",neutral
China-US trade talks to restart after G20 tariff truce,"
BEIJING (AFP) - US and Chinese negotiators meet in Shanghai on Tuesday to resurrect trade talks between the world’s two biggest economies, with both sides downplaying expectations there will be an imminent deal.
The negotiations in China’s financial hub will be the first face-to-face discussions since negotiations collapsed in May, when US President Donald Trump accused China of reneging on its commitments.
Washington and Beijing have so far hit each other with punitive tariffs covering more than $360 billion in two-way trade, in a tense stand-off centred on demands for China to curb the alleged theft of American technology and provide a level-playing field to US companies.
The two days of talks are to be led on the US side by trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
The negotiations come as Beijing faces heavy pressure over ongoing civil unrest in Hong Kong, and with lingering ill-feeling between the US and China.
Days before the Shanghai meeting, Trump threatened to pull recognition of China’s developing nation status at the World Trade Organization -- prompting an irritable reply from Beijing about the ""arrogance and selfishness"" of the US, which state media said was using pressure ahead of the trade talks.
Trump said Friday he believed Chinese negotiators were hoping to delay a deal until after the US presidential election next year, adding: ""When I win... they’re all going to sign deals.""
The US leader has also angered the Chinese side by claiming the slowing economy is forcing them to make a trade deal, and blacklisting telecom giant Huawei over national security concerns.
But the kick-starting of trade negotiations is being seen as positive -- even if little of substance is expected -- following a truce agreed between Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping at the G20 in June.
""Realistically, this round of talks is about clarifying where the two sides stand after a significant lull in engagement,"" said Jake Parker, senior vice president at the US-China Business Council.
""There also needs to be a focus on rebuilding trust that was present in April but has since dissipated.""

‘Modest concessions’

Holding talks in Shanghai is also a nod to a time of better relations, as the home of the 1972 Shanghai Communique -- an important step in building diplomatic relations between the US and China.
Vice Premier Liu He will likely lead the talks for China again, with the addition of Chinese Commerce Minister Zhong Shan, seen as a tougher negotiator.
""Minister Zhong Shan, like Liu He, is a 19th Party Congress Central Committee member, so his involvement would indicate an elevation of participation on the Chinese side,"" said Parker.
""His appointment could offer another senior voice... on the Chinese side.""
But both sides were busy lowering expectations in the run-up to talks.
Mnuchin told CNBC last week there were still ""a lot of issues"" while Chinese state-run daily The Global Times wrote that it is ""widely believed that trade talks will take a long time"".
There are likely to be ""modest soft-pedalled concessions"", said Stephen Innes, managing partner at Vanguard Markets Singapore, such as new Chinese purchases of US agricultural products or a pause of further tariff increases on Chinese exports to the US.
""Following another month of escalating tensions, agreement on practically anything will be a positive,"" said Innes.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-30-19/news_big_images/502766_27827195.jpg,business,"Days before the Shanghai meeting, Trump threatened to pull recognition of China’s developing nation status at the World Trade Organization -- prompting an irritable reply from Beijing about the ""arrogance and selfishness"" of the US, which state media said was using pressure ahead of the trade talks.",neutral
Oil prices rise ahead of expected U.S. interest rate cut,"
TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil prices extended overnight gains on Tuesday amid widespread expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade this week.
Brent crude LCOc1 rose 30 cents, or 0.5%, to $64.01 a barrel by 0013 GMT, after gaining 0.4% the previous session.
U.S. crude <CLc1 was up 34 cents or 0.6%, at $57.21 a barrel, having risen 1.2% on Monday.
Crude futures are “well bid on the back of rising expectations of a rate cut in the U.S.,” ANZ Research said in a morning note, adding that optimism over Sino-U.S. trade talks and Middle East tensions are also supporting prices.
U.S. central bankers will begin their two-day meeting later in the day and are expected to lower borrowing costs for the first time since the depths of the financial crisis more than a decade ago.
U.S. President Donald Trump said a small rate cut “is not enough.”
Economic growth in the United States slowed less than expected in the second quarter, strengthening the outlook for oil consumption but, elsewhere, disappointing economic data has increased concerns about slower growth.
U.S. and Chinese negotiators meet this week for their first in-person talks since a G20 truce last month, with some optimistic that the discussions will help bridge the gap between the world’s two largest economies.
However, Trump said China might not want to sign a trade deal until after the 2020 U.S. election.
Supply risks are still a concern as tensions remained high around the Strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of the world’s oil passes.
Tensions spiked between Iran and the West after Iranian commandos seized a British-flagged oil tanker in the Gulf this month in apparent retaliation for the capture of an Iranian tanker by British forces near Gibraltar.

Marble products in tribal areas exempted from taxes: Hammad,"
ISLAMABAD (APP) – Minister for Economic Affairs Hammad Azhar on Monday told the National Assembly that the marble products produced and then sold in former federally and provincially administered tribal areas were exempted from taxes.

Australia win toss and bat against England in 1st Ashes Test,"
BIRMINGHAM (AFP) – Australia captain Tim Paine won the toss and decided to bat in the first Ashes Test against England at Edgbaston on Thursday.
Ashes-holders Australia have not won a match of any kind at Edgbaston since 2001, while England have won their past 11 internationals at the Birmingham ground.
Australia are looking for their first Ashes series win in England in 18 years.
""The wicket looks nice and hard and dry,"" said Paine at the toss. ""Hopefully we post a good total and we’ve got (off-spinner) Nathan Lyon up our sleeve at the back end of the game.""
As expected, the visitors included all three players given lengthy bans for their roles in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last year -- David Warner, Cameron Bancroft and former captain Steve Smith.
Openers Bancroft and Warner knew they would be booed on their way to the middle, judging by the hostile reception Warner and top-order batsman Smith received during the recent World Cup in England and Wales.
They did not have to wait even that long to face the boo-boys, with the Australia team as a whole jeered onto the field for a pre-match anthem ceremony -- an unusual occurrence before a Test match in England.
Reserve wicketkeeper Matthew Wade was included as a specialist batsman after making three hundreds for Australia A on their tour of England.
Usman Khawaja was also back in the top order following a hamstring injury that cut short his involvement in the World Cup, which saw Australia defeated by eventual champions England in an Edgbaston semi-final.
Australia also included experienced paceman Peter Siddle, who has been playing English county cricket this season for Essex, in an attack featuring James Pattinson and Pat Cummins.
""He’s a class performer there,"" said wicketkeeper Paine. ""He complements the other two seamers really nicely.""
But there was no place for World Cup spearhead Mitchell Starc.
England captain Joe Root named his side on Wednesday.
James Anderson, England’s all-time leading wicket-taker, returned after missing last week’s win in a one-off Test against Ireland at Lord’s.
But World Cup hero Jofra Archer was left waiting for a Test debut after struggling with a side injury.
Fellow World Cup winners Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler returned after being rested against Ireland.
Root had no qualms about losing the toss, saying: ""I’m not disappointed at all. It’s overcast conditions. It’ll be nice to get off to a good start.
""We’ve go so many great options to go to, especially with the ball. This morning is a great opportunity to exploit that.
""We love playing here, we get fantastic support wherever we go. The atmosphere here in particular is extremely exciting.""
The Edgbaston match is the first of a five-Test series and the first of the ICC’s new World Test Championship, with players’ names and squad numbers displayed on the backs of their shirts for the first time in this format.

The ball factory arming swing king Anderson with his weapon of choice,"
LONDON (Reuters) - It is easy to imagine England’s record-breaking bowler James Anderson walking around Dilip Jajodia’s cricket ball factory in London’s East End wearing the expression of a child in a toy shop.
The sight of a box load of freshly polished cherry-red Dukes balls would surely quicken the pulse of the 37-year-old paceman, who has made the leather spheres his weapon of a choice over a distinguished test career.



Jajodia, managing director of British Cricket Balls Ltd, has been busy overseeing the production and delivery of the 60 Dukes balls that will be used in the five-test Ashes series between England and Australia, starting at Edgbaston on Thursday.
The reason Anderson’s eyes light up when he is thrown a new Dukes is that 368 of his 575 test wickets have come on home soil, where the ball has been the default during his long career.
Chuck him an Australia-manufactured Kookaburra, the brand used outside England and West Indies, and his bowling has been not nearly as effective.
The reason, Jajodia explains, is the pronounced hand-stitched seam that allows the Dukes ball to retain its “rudder” and aerodynamic qualities longer than machine-stitched balls.
Put simply, when delivered correctly, it swings more and for longer.
“A machine-stitched ball has two rows of stitches, with hand stitching there are six rows which hold the ball together and that means it retains its shape even after 60 overs,” he told Reuters as three employees lovingly prepared the next batch.
“The fascination of cricket is that the ball changes its characteristics to suit different style of bowling. The Dukes ball is crafted to deteriorate slowly over 80 overs.





“Whereas the seam on a machine-stitched ball tends to go flat after being whacked around for 60 overs, the seam on our balls remains pronounced even when it’s old.”
Jajodia bought the 259-year-old business in 1987 when the entire production process was carried out in Kent, to the south of the British capital.
PERFECT SPHERE
Since the mid-1990s, however, the raw material, premium-grade cow hide, has been sourced in Britain, cut into strips, then sent to the sub-continent to be stitched over the inner ball of rubber and cork by skilled craftsmen.
Four strips make up one ball with the highest-quality leather coming from close to the spine of the hide.
“Mix leather from the back with the stomach in one ball and it all goes pear-shaped,” Jajodia said.
Once stitched, the balls are shipped back to his Walthamstow premises for finishing.
That involves embossing the distinctive coat of arms, checking the size (maximum 9 inches) and weight (156-163g), then milling — a process where the ball is inserted into a vice-like round mould and gently squeezed to create a perfect sphere.
After that a wax is carefully melted into the leather before a final layer of polish is applied.
“The wax is heated when players rub the ball on their trousers and comes to the surface to renew the shine and help it swing,” Jajodi says.
Added to his global customers next year will be Australia’s Sheffield Shield state championship — a move that in the long term is sure to reduce the fear Australian batsmen sometimes experience when facing the unfamiliar Dukes.
Jajodia, though, dismisses any suggestion he was asked to produce a ball with an even more pronounced seam for the Ashes series.
“Actually, for the English county season the ECB asked us to slightly flatten the seam to give the batsmen more of a chance,” he said.
“But with the Ashes looming the powers that be said can we go back to the 2018 specification, the one the produced one of the best series ever against India.
“The modern game has become batter-friendly and I see the Dukes as evening it up a bit. But people think anyone can make a Dukes ball move in the air. It’s still an incredible skill.
“I watched the test at Lord’s last week (when England were bowled out for 85 and Ireland for 38) and it was amazing to watch. There was not much movement, but just enough.”
Anderson did not play in that match but he will be back at Edgbaston, Dukes ball in hand.

Clinical Sri Lanka whitewash 'negative' Bangladesh,"
COLOMBO (AFP) - Sri Lanka put on a clinical performance with bat and ball to record a 122-run win in the third and final one-day international and complete a clean sweep over Bangladesh in Colombo on Wednesday.
Former captain Angelo Mathews led Sri Lanka with 87 off 90 balls, guiding the side to 294-8 before Dasun Shanaka backed his 30 off 14 with three wickets for 27 runs to complete the rout.
Somuya Sarkar hit the only half-century for Bangladesh, 69 off 86 balls, but it gave Sri Lanka no trouble as the visitors were bowled out for 172.
Kasun Rajitha (2-17) and Lahiru Kumara (2-26) complemented Shanaka with the ball to complete the victory in 36 overs.
Leg-spinner Akila Dananjaya deceived Soumya with his flight to bowl the left-hander in the 32nd over for his only wicket, rendering the rest of the game a mere formality.
Tail-ender Taijul Islam s unbeaten 39 off 28 balls only managed to entertain a sparse crowd at the R. Premadasa Stadium and delay the result.
""I worked hard after getting dropped from the side. I was confident with my batting which helped me perform well. We re all relieved as a team because we performed together,"" Shanaka said after the match.
The home side won the first two matches respectively by 91 runs and seven wickets.
""There are a lot of negatives, starting from myself to the team. We have to hold it tight and come back strong,"" said Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal, who scored 21 runs in the three matches.
Mathews and Kusal Mendis, who made 54 off 58 balls, set the platform for Sri Lanka s big innings after skipper Dimuth Karunaratne won the toss and elected to bat first.
Mathews and Mendis put on 101 for the fourth wicket.
Bangladesh got an early breakthrough when Shafiul Islam removed Avishka Fernando for six but Karunaratne (46) and Kusal Perera (42) steadied the innings with an 83-run stand.
Left-arm spinner Taijul Islam removed Karunaratne to break the partnership and Rubel Hossain got rid of Perera in the next over to bring Bangladesh back into the contest.
But Mathews and Mendis snatched the momentum back thanks to some sloppy fielding by Bangladeshi players.
Mushfiqur Rahim dropped Mathews on 32 off Shafiul before Sabbir Rahman gave the former Sri Lankan captain another life on 63 off Mehidy Hasan s bowling.
Mathews, who hit eight fours and a six, was finally dismissed by Soumya Sarkar in the last over but not before Bangladesh reviewed a caught behind appeal initially dismissed by on-field umpire.
Soumya finished with 3-56 while medium pace Shafiul also claimed 3-68.
The island nation s cricket board has dedicated the match to pace bowler Nuwan Kulasekara who announced his retirement last week.
Tamim-led Bangladesh wore black armbands to pay respect to their first national captain, Shamim Kabir, who died on Monday.

England captain Root glad to have Stokes as his Ashes deputy,"
BIRMINGHAM (AFP) - England captain Joe Root is looking forward to having ""natural leader"" Ben Stokes back alongside him as his Test deputy during the Ashes.
The pair have been friends since their days playing youth cricket, with Root lobbying for Stokes s return to a position the all-rounder held until he was involved in a street brawl in Bristol in 2017.
Stokes missed five months of international cricket, including England s 4-0 Ashes series loss in Australia under Root, before being cleared of affray in a court case in August 2018.
But the 28-year-old was one of the stars of England s triumphant World Cup campaign earlier this season and Root, also involved in that success, is eager to have Stokes back as his Test vice-captain after Jos Buttler took over the role.
""I have asked for a long time (to have Stokes back as vice-captain) but he was made available at the end of the World Cup,"" Root said during his pre-match press conference at Edgbaston on Wednesday, on the eve of the series opener.
""It is fantastic to have Ben back, not just playing and playing back somewhere near his best -- it has been coming a long time.
""The way he stepped up in big moments in that World Cup was just him down to a tee. It is what he does -- he responds well to responsibility and to the big moments.
""He offers with all three departments -- he bowls, bats and he is one of the best fielders and he drags people with him as a natural leader on the field and in the dressing room.""
Root praised Buttler but said Buttler was aware Stokes would be brought back as vice-captain when there was an opportunity to do so.
England s World Cup win under the leadership of one-day specialist Eoin Morgan achieved a long-held goal but Root rejected suggestions that meant the pressure to regain the Ashes had eased as a result.
""I think if you speak to anyone who has captained England and is on the verge of an Ashes series, to say it doesn t mean as much as any other event, I don t think any of them would agree,"" he said.
""It s huge. It s a great opportunity. Cricket in this country is probably at an all-time high, it s got interest it probably hasn t had for a long time and we ve got an opportunity as a team to make this summer a very memorable one.""
Root is going back up to number three in the batting order and Joe Denly dropping down to four as England look to shore up their struggling line-up.
""I think it s important to spread the experience out and it gives me an opportunity to lead from the front as well,"" said Root, England s best batsman.
""I also feel I m in a place where I ve got my head around the captaincy and my batting and I m able to separate the two.""
World Cup-winner Jofra Archer will have to wait for his Test debut after the fast bowler was left out of England s team announced on Wednesday following his struggles with a side injury.
""Jofra is obviously coming back from a very serious injury,"" said Root. ""We looked at conditions, what we thought was best... and it also allows him time to get absolutely ready and fit.""

Australia captain Paine feels no pressure for his place as Ashes loom,"
BIRMINGHAM (AFP) - Australia captain Tim Paine says he has no fears about losing his place as he prepares to lead his team in the first Ashes Test against England on Thursday.
The wicketkeeper found himself unexpectedly thrust into a leadership position in the fall-out from last year s ball-tampering scandal in South Africa.
Then-captain Steve Smith and David Warner, his deputy, were stripped of their positions by Cricket Australia after the incident and both were banned from international cricket for 12 months.
Australia s squad for the Ashes includes another wicketkeeper in Matthew Wade, who has already played 22 Tests.
Wade has been in fine form with the bat during the recent Australia A tour of England, scoring three hundreds.
By contrast, Paine has managed just one first-class century in his entire career.
Asked during a pre-match press conference at Edgbaston on Wednesday if he felt under pressure to justify his place, Paine replied: ""No, I do not at all. I m 34 years old, I don t really care about my place in the side any more. I m here to do a job.
""I ve been put in this team to captain and wicket-keep to the best of my ability and I ve said before, at 34 years of age, if you are looking further ahead than the next Test match you are kidding yourself.
""I m not going to waste time looking over my shoulder. I m enjoying the job that I m doing.""
With Cameron Bancroft, the man who applied sandpaper to the ball during that fateful Test in Cape Town, also set to be included in Australia s team for the Ashes opener alongside Smith and Warner, there will be a renewed focus on the tourists  on-field conduct.
But the side, under the leadership of Australia one-day captain Aaron Finch, conducted themselves in exemplary fashion during the recent World Cup in England and Wales.
Paine said they were taking their cue from Winston Churchill although there is doubt over whether Britain s prime minister during World War II ever said the words ascribed to him by the Australians.
""We are going to play competitive Test match cricket like every other nation does,"" he said.
""Our guys understand what s expected of them and we are role models,"" added Paine, with Australia looking to win their first Ashes series in England since 2001.
""There s been a quote going around our changing rooms this week from Winston Churchill and that is  behaviour doesn t lie .
""We can talk all we like about how we are going to play and ultimately you guys will see how we play and judge for yourselves,"" added Paine, who said the tourists had been made aware of the quote by assistant coach Brad Haddin, the former Australia wicketkeeper who was renowned for  sledging  or verbally abusing opponents during his playing days.
Meanwhile Paine was glad of the strength in depth of an Australia fast-bowling unit where Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, James Pattinson, Josh Hazlewood and Peter Siddle are all vying for a place in the side.
""We are in a really good situation at the moment where we have a number of quality fast bowlers in particular,"" Paine said.
""We are lucky that we feel we have a lot of bases covered,"" added the skipper who said Australia would name their team at the toss, unlike England, who confirmed their side on Wednesday.
""It s up to us to come up with the best combinations to take 20 wickets.
""Our quicks that have been here before, have learnt lessons from being here before. It s important that we learn from them and put what we ve learnt into practice in this series.""

Australia eager to end Edgbaston hoodoo,"
BIRMINGHAM (AFP) - Australia head into the first Test at Edgbaston determined to complete ""unfinished business"" as they look to end their long record without a win at England s  fortress .
You have to go back to the 2001 Ashes for the last time Australia enjoyed a a victory of any kind at the Birmingham ground.
That winless streak across all formats at Warwickshire s headquarters was extended to 15 matches when they lost to England in a World Cup semi-final earlier this month.
By contrast, England have won their last 11 internationals at the ground.
With England looking to regain the Ashes, and Australia not having won them on English soil in 19 years, Edgbaston appears to be the perfect venue for the series opener from the home side s perspective.
But Australia s Matthew Wade said the tourists would love nothing more than to make a little bit of history of their own at the venue.
""I feel like Edgbaston is unfinished business for a lot of us,"" said Wade, who is hoping to make his first Test appearance in almost two years.
""A lot of us haven t got good memories here, so we have to create some now. They ve got a great record here but what s happened before doesn t really matter.
""I think this is the start of another chapter and we re excited to get out there. Edgbaston is a hectic crowd, all the crowds are over here, but as long as we re enjoying each other s company out there then the other noise doesn t really bother us.""
Wade made his name as a wicketkeeper but with the gloves now taken by Australia captain Tim Paine, a fellow Tasmanian, the 31-year-old is looking to relaunch his Test career as a specialist batsman.
""I basically started a whole different career playing solely as a batter,"" said Wade, a veteran of 22 Tests.
""Being here is a reward for a lot of hard work over a two-year period. I ve really enjoyed not keeping...there s not that sickening feeling every time you walk out to keep in a session.
""I find it a lot easier to streamline my training. When you re keeping in Test cricket you have to put a boatload of work into it.
""Over in England it s as important as scoring runs.""

"Nash, who was hit by Sobers for six sixes in an over, dies at 74","
LONDON (AFP) - Malcolm Nash, the Glamorgan bowler who entered cricket folklore when Garfield Sobers struck him for six sixes in an over, has died at the age of 74.
Nash s name was forever linked with that of Sobers after the West Indies star went on the attack during a County Championship match between Glamorgan and Nottinghamshire at Swansea in 1968.
It was the first time any batsman had hit six sixes in an over in first-class cricket.
The first five balls were dispatched cleanly by the West Indian and the sixth was carried over the ropes by a fielder.
Sobers had been frustrated by his team s slow progress as Nottinghamshire were approaching a declaration and Nash was experimenting with slow bowling.
Nash, a left-armer, took 993 first-class wickets in a 17-year career between 1966 and 1983, while also scoring 7,129 runs and holding 148 catches.
""Malcolm was a true Glamorgan legend whose exploits have gone down in club folklore,"" chief executive Hugh Morris told the club s website.
""His name is connected with that of Garry Sobers... but he was a fantastic cricketer who was an integral part of the club s history and the side that lifted the County Championship in 1969.""
Nash died in hospital in London after being taken ill at a function at Lord s Cricket Ground on Tuesday.

"Australia's Khawaja, Pattinson confirmed for Ashes opener","
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia coach Justin Langer has confirmed James Pattinson and Usman Khawaja are certain starters for the opening Ashes test in Birmingham.
Khawaja passed a fitness test on Monday after recovering from a hamstring injury and Langer confirmed the left-hander will bat at number three, while fast bowler Pattinson is set to feature in his first test match since Feb. 2016.
“Usman Khawaja will definitely be in,” Langer told reporters. “He’s fit, ready to go, he’s playing well.
“He’s a seasoned pro for us, he averages 40-odd in Test cricket, his hammy (hamstring) is good, he’s running well, he’s passed all the fitness tests so he’s ready to go. He’ll bat number three.”
On Pattinson’s return to the lineup, Langer added: (He’s) just a very, very good bowler. I’m sure (captain Tim Paine) will work out ways of using him.”
Selectors face several crunch decisions ahead of the first test at Edgbaston starting Thursday, with Langer consigning Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and Peter Siddle to a three-way duel for the third specialist fast bowling spot.
“Like in all these selections, there’s literally a case for 17 blokes to play,” Langer said.
“There’s probably three to be fair, Starcy, Peter Siddle and Josh Hazlewood, for one spot.
“We won’t rotate them per se, but we’ll just pick the best three, probably not four, but three for every game. It won’t be different opposition, certainly different conditions.”
While Steve Smith and David Warner both featured and looked the part at the recent World Cup, Cameron Bancroft - the third player banned after the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last year - is still working his way back into the team.
Bancroft earned his Ashes call-up with an unbeaten knock of 93 in the intra-squad match last week and is now vying with Marcus Harris to open the batting alongside Warner.
“It would be a great story if (Bancroft) comes back into the team. His development after what happened in Cape Town has been extraordinary,” Langer said of the 26-year-old he previously coached for Western Australia.
“We know what the reception is going to be. There’s nothing we can do about it. We don’t know (how he will cope) but we’ll find out.

England captain Root returns to No. 3 spot for Ashes opener,"
BIRMINGHAM (AFP) - Joe Denly confirmed on Tuesday that he would drop to number four in the batting order for England s opening Ashes Test against Australia, with captain Joe Root replacing him at number three.
Root has previously made clear he prefers batting at four but the Yorkshireman is understood to have approached England coach Trevor Bayliss after last week s Test win over Ireland about returning to his old position when the Ashes opener starts at Edgbaston on Thursday.
Although England beat Ireland by skittling out the visitors for 38 in their second innings at Lord s, they only managed 85 all out themselves in their first innings.
Bayliss has long wanted Root, England s best batsman, to bat at number three following a succession of top-order collapses that have seen the skipper walking out to bat at four when two cheap wickets have fallen.
Root averages 48 at number four in the order but a shade over 40 when batting at number three.
But with England openers Jason Roy and Rory Burns having played just eight Tests between them, the logic in having 81-Test veteran Root bat at number three is clear.
Denly, speaking at Edgbaston on Tuesday, said: ""Joe Root will bat at three and I ll be batting at four.
""He rang me the other day and told me he wanted to bat three and for me to go in at four. I think Rooty just wanted to get involved in the game, get up there and get out in the middle.""
""I m very excited. I wasn t too fussed where I d be batting, it s just great to be in the eleven. I ve batted at four before for Kent and throughout my career, so it really wasn t a big issue,"" he added. ""I m just happy to be playing.""
Denly may be 33 but the Kent batsman has played just three Tests and this will be his first Ashes series.
He had a brief stint as a limited-overs international a decade ago but it seemed Test cricket had passed him by.
However, a return to form and the arrival of his former Kent teammate Ed Smith as national selector saw him given a Test debut against the West Indies in Antigua earlier this year.
""Everyone from a young age dreams of playing in an Ashes series and to finally get that chance, being quite an old campaigner, I m certainly excited and up for the challenge,"" said Denly.
""There s no doubt that the Australian bowling line-up is one of the best in the world. They have all bases covered really and, as a top-order batter, that is where you want to be, testing yourself against the best.""
Denly just missed out on a place in England s triumphant World Cup squad, being replaced by Hampshire spinner Liam Dawson, who did not play a game.
""I think it was the right decision,"" he said. ""I thought it might happen and it was a great opportunity for me to go back and play some red-ball cricket with Kent and get some good form going into this series.""

Langer predicts hostile Ashes reception for Bancroft from England fans,"
BIRMINGHAM (AFP) - Australia coach Justin Langer says an Ashes return for Cameron Bancroft would be ""a great story"" but knows he will face a hostile reception from England fans after his ball-tampering ban.
Bancroft, 26, is set to open the batting in Thursday s first Test at Edgbaston, with Australia s top order also likely to feature David Warner and Steve Smith.
If that is the case, it would mean all three players who were banned for their roles in the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last year would be in Australia s XI.
Smith and Warner have already experienced plenty of boos from English crowds during the recent World Cup.
Bancroft, not selected for the one-day tournament, will almost certainly experience more of the same given he was the one who actually applied sandpaper to the ball during a Test away to South Africa in a blatant flouting of cricket s rulebook.
""It would be a great story if he comes back into the team,"" Langer said at Edgbaston on Tuesday.
""His development after what happened in Cape Town has been extraordinary.""
Langer, a former Australia opener, said: ""We know what the reception is going to be. There s nothing we can do about it. We don t know (how he will cope) actually, but we ll find out.
""He s a good kid and as tough as anyone you could meet. To endure the scrutiny of the past 14 months, especially the first part of it, I think he s had a pretty good dress rehearsal.""
Langer confirmed batsman Usman Khawaja, who missed Australia s World Cup semi-final defeat by England at Edgbaston with a hamstring injury, had been passed fit and would play in the opening match of the five-Test series.
""He s a seasoned pro for us, he averages 40-odd in Test cricket, his hammy is good, he s running well, he s passed all the fitness tests, so he s ready to go,"" Langer said.
Fast bowler James Pattinson is also set to feature in what would be his first Test since February 2016, lining up alongside Pat Cummins and one of Mitchell Starc, Peter Siddle or Josh Hazlewood in Australia s pace attack.
""There s probably three to be fair -- Starcy, Peter Siddle and Josh Hazlewood -- for one spot,"" added Langer.

Sri Lanka coach given deadline to quit: minister,"
COLOMBO (AFP) - Sri Lanka was considering applications from three ""top international cricket coaches"" to replace incumbent Chandika Hathurusingha, who has until mid-August to step down, the country s sports minister said Tuesday.
Harin Fernando said Hathurusingha would be given until the start of Sri Lanka s home Test series against New Zealand, which begins on August 14, to quit and make way for a new coach.
""Before the New Zealand Test series we will have a new coach,"" Fernando told reporters in Colombo.
""If Hathurusingha does not leave, we may have to consider legal action or offer him a different job at the board.""
Following Sri Lanka s disappointing World Cup, where they finished in sixth-place, Hathurusingha and his assistants were expected to be shown the door.
Fernando said there were three top international coaches willing to replace Hathurusingha, a former Sri Lankan Test player.
Earlier Tuesday Fernando said Hathurusingha s remuneration -- $40,000 a month -- was too high, adding: ""If we are winning only 35 percent of the games, no need to pay such high fees to coaches.""
Fernando said the international candidates were asking for lower salaries of between $17,500 to $25,000 a month, but did not name them.
""For the price we are paying now, we can get two foreign coaches,"" he said.
""We must renegotiate the high fees we are paying at the moment. If they don t agree, they can go.""
Meanwhile Hathurusingha has insisted he would stay to see out his contract.
""I have another 16 months,"" he told reporters earlier this month after returning to Colombo from the World Cup in England. ""I hope to remain until my contract runs out.""
Hathurusingha also acknowledged that team management had to ""accept responsibility for what happened"".
Sri Lanka cricket was in crisis when Hathurusingha was appointed in December 2017, after a successful three-year spell in charge of Bangladesh.
They had just been hammered in Tests by India at home and away, and played poorly in one-day internationals. Under Hathurusingha, Sri Lanka notched up Test wins against England and Australia.
The first Test against New Zealand will be played in Galle starting August 14, and the second will begin on August 22 at Colombo s P. Sara stadium.
Three T20s will be played on August 31, September 2 and September 6.

the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) ruled that the 19-year-old ""inadvertently ingested a prohibited substance, which can commonly be found in cough syrups"".
The suspension was backdated to mid-March, meaning Shaw will be eligible for selection after November 15.
The BCCI added in its statement that Shaw’s urine sample collected on February 22 in Indore was ""found to contain terbutaline"".
""Terbutaline, a specified substance, is prohibited both in and out of competition in the WADA Prohibited List of Substances,"" it added.
The governing body added that it was satisfied Shaw had taken the substance to treat a respiratory infection and not as a performance-enhancing drug.
Shaw said in a statement on Twitter that ""the news has really shaken me"".
""I accept my fate with all sincerity,"" he said, adding that the suspension was a reminder of the risk for professional athletes of taking medicine for illnesses.
""Cricket is my life and there is no bigger pride for me than playing for India and Mumbai and I will come out of this faster and stronger,"" he said.

Back injury rules out Naseem Shah from PSL,"
LAHORE (APP) - Promising pace bowler Naseem Shah was thinking of ways of celebrating wickets in the HBL Pakistan Super League 2019, but a back injury, sustained while bowling in an U19 camp at the National Cricket Academy in Lahore, ruled him out of the prestigious league.
A CT scan revealed that the 16-year-old had a fracture, only a mention of which is enough to set alarm bells ringing for any fast-bowler. But, a chat with Sarfaraz Ahmed — the captain of Quetta Gladiators, a franchise for which Naseem had to turn out — did wonders for his morale, necessary to overcome the rigours of a rehab.

Miley Cyrus latest star to abandon Woodstock 50,"
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Miley Cyrus was reported on Tuesday to have pulled out of the troubled Woodstock 50 festival, joining a string of other big names who say they will no longer take part in the official event meant to mark the anniversary of the landmark 1969 music festival.

Cyrus, one of America’s biggest pop stars, was one of the headliners for the event planned for Aug. 16-18, which has been mired in financial and permit problems.

Variety and Rolling Stone cited sources close to the situation as saying Cyrus would no longer take part. Representatives of the “Wrecking Ball” singer did not return requests for comment.

Rapper Jay-Z withdrew last week, along with former Creedence Clearwater Revival frontman John Fogerty as Woodstock 50 organizers sought a third venue, this time at a small amphitheater in Columbia, Maryland. 

In the past few days Dead & Company, Carlos Santana, and rock bands the Lumineers and the Raconteurs have also pulled out, their representatives told Rolling Stone magazine.

Tickets have yet to go on sale for the festival, which, according to media reports, may now be a free, one-day event with an attendance scaled down from more than 100,000 to around 30,000.

Woodstock 50, with an 80-act lineup, was first planned for the Watkins Glen motor racing venue in upstate New York, but the site pulled out in June. Organizers then attempted in vain to seek permits in Vernon, New York.

The proposed new venue is the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Maryland.

The nonprofit Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, the current owner of the field where the 1969 Woodstock festival took place, has also scaled back plans for a three-day anniversary event. It said in February it will instead host separate concerts by Ringo Starr, Santana and the Doobie Brothers.

Salman Khan gifts diamond ring to lulia Vantur on her birthday: reports,"
Mumbai (Online): If the industry buzz is to be believed, Salman Khan gifted rumoured girlfriend Iulia Vantur a diamond ring on her birthday last week. 

The superstar is known to splurge on his near and dear ones, so it is not exactly a surprise. But what has set tongues wagging is that it is a diamond ring and not just any bauble. Is there more to it or should we not read too much into it? Time will tell.

Meanwhile, sharing the excitement with the fans, Iulia Vantur also shared a few snaps and videos and wrote: ""Thank u for making my day & my life more beautiful. I’m grateful for your love, friendship and care. Thank u for all your beautiful messages. I’m sending to each one of u a lot of love and gratitude. It s all about love #iuliavantur #birthday #friends #love [sic]""

On the professional front, Iulia Vantur’s Bollywood debut vehicle Radha Kyun Gori Main Kyun Kala had hit a roadblock after producer Prernaa Arora was arrested by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) in December, for allegedly cheating Vashu Bhagnani of Rs 32 crore. Now, the movie is back on track.

Talking about Salman Khan’s work commitments, he is currently shooting for Dabangg 3, and the actor will soon start for the second instalment of Kick. Sajid Nadiadwala is working round the clock to get an interesting script ready for the film to go on floors in 2020. Once the script is locked, the crew will hunt for locations.

As of now, Salman Khan is reprising his role of Devil, and other star casts are yet to be signed.

Meanwhile, in Dabangg 3, the makers have decided upon having a sizzling dance number in the instalment. However, there’s a twist this time. The dance song will not have a female but male actor, and he is none other than Salman Khan himself. He will be seen dancing on the song Munna Badnaam Hua. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-30-19/news_big_images/502777_84672917.jpg,entertainment,"Meanwhile, sharing the excitement with the fans, Iulia Vantur also shared a few snaps and videos and wrote: ""Thank u for making my day & my life more beautiful.",neutral
Mega-hit 'Old Town Road' breaks US singles chart record,"
NEW YORK (AFP) - Overnight sensation Lil Nas X continued his wild ride of pop music domination Monday, taking the reins of the record for longest stretch atop the US singles chart at 17 weeks with his infectious country-trap smash ""Old Town Road.""
The viral mega-hit that mashes banjo twangs with thumping bass from the unknown artist-turned-industry maverick topped the Billboard record of 16 weeks on the industry s most closely watched singles chart.
That was set by 1995 s ""One Sweet Day"" by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men and matched by the 2017 Latin juggernaut ""Despacito"" by Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber.
""YEEE TF HAWWW,"" Lil Nas X tweeted after the news broke.
After first grabbing attention on the video-sharing app TikTok, Lil Nas X, 20, soared into the public consciousness when his genre-bending hit booted Ariana Grande from the Billboard chart s overall spot in April, also fending off advances from pop royalty including Bieber and Taylor Swift.
Since then, the meme king has shrewdly goosed his numbers by releasing remix after remix of the snappy track, most notably with country star Billy Rae Cyrus, which is the one listed on the Billboard chart.
As long as remixes are in line with the original sound of a song, the streams, downloads and sales are included in one composite number.
Just last week, Lil Nas X released yet another new version featuring a member of BTS, the wildly popular South Korean group -- a remix that appeared to ensure the artist would maintain his rule.
In its unprecedented 17th week on the Billboard Hot 100, ""Road"" notched 72.5 million US streams and 46,000 downloads sold. Its numbers again bested breakout pop star Billie Eilish, whose song ""bad guy"" has held the number two spot for seven total weeks.
Controversy famously stoked the artist s rise to fame after Billboard removed the fusion novelty song from the country charts but left it on the rap list, triggering accusations that the Atlanta musician s work was pigeonholed purely because he is black.
He never returned to the country chart -- despite the collaboration with Cyrus -- but his unstoppable hit has stayed atop the Hot R&B/Hip Hop and Hot Rap songs chart for 17 weeks.
In a lengthy tweeted note filled with emojis, the artist born Montero Lamar Hill said that just last year he was struggling and living on his sister s couch: ""I jokingly/seriously saw myself as a loner cowboy need to run away from it all.""
His breakout song ""needed to be funny, it need to be catchy, it needed to be hip hop, it needed to be country & it needed to be short,"" he continued.
""This song has changed my life and the way i see the world around me in less than a year,"" he said. ""It s just the beginning!""
Since the release of ""Road,"" Lil Nas X has also dropped an EP entitled ""7,"" which includes the aforementioned megahit s original and Billy Rae Cyrus remix along with a song featuring rap star Cardi B.
Asked earlier whether she was worried about the prospect of losing her record to the novice artist, diva Carey deadpanned: ""Darling, no.""
On Twitter, he had invited the pop icon to record a remix of the song with him, which she responded to by posting a picture of herself in a cowboy hat with the caption ""One Sweet Town Road!""
Lil Nas X had told TMZ he might send Carey roses upon breaking her record, ""since I love her.""

It was just not the look but the action sequences were also to be performed by him, for which he had to get fit.

On the first day of training he could’nt even do push-ups nor did his kicks got higher than an inch or two. But he was motivated and inspired by the likes of Mohammad Ali. He trained for 4-5 hours a day and by the end of the training was ready to perform all the fight sequences.

Bulgarian singer hits high with record-breaking vocals,"
STAROSEL (AFP) - Smilyana Zaharieva knew she had a gift when she saw her audience tremble or cry during her performances.
Now an official Guinness world record confirms that the Bulgarian singer has one of the most powerful voices on the planet, which can stay pitch perfect despite being as loud as a rock concert.
Zaharieva says she burst into tears when she received the official Guinness world record certificate last month, confirming she had achieved the loudest mezzo-soprano vocal note.
""When I saw the monitor reading 113.8 decibels, it surprised me,"" the 48-year-old told AFP of her record-setting attempt last September.

Tough requirements 


Irish teacher Annalisa Flanagan holds the world’s loudest shouting record with 121 decibels (dB), but there was no previous singing record.
The lively Bulgarian from the southern city of Plovdiv faced a series of tough requirements.
Zaharieva had to sing in a quiet studio and go over 110 dB, the average human discomfort threshold, with the sound meter placed 2.5 metres (8.2 feet) away from her while also holding the note for a minimum of five seconds.
According to popular noise level charts Zaharieva’s achievement of 113.8 dB roughly amounts to the same loudness you would hear at a rock concert, a symphony orchestra or an emergency vehicle siren.
""The Bulgarian folklore voice is characterised by its power,"" says Dora Hristova, the longtime choir master of the world-famous The Mystery Of The Bulgarian Voices.
""Folk singers are born with this physiology, with this natural voice.""

‘Exceptional register ‘ 


As a child, Zaharieva studied folk singing in the National School of Folklore Art in the Rhodope mountains in southern Bulgaria before pursuing a degree from the Plovdiv Conservatory of Music.
For several years she was part of another women’s choir, The Great Voices of Bulgaria, touring the world.
""When I sang people would tremble or cry,"" she said.
But in 1996 she put an end to her career.
""One day when I returned home, my little daughter didn’t recognise me. That broke my heart,"" she said.
Opening a tour agency with her husband, she only sang for her family and close friends. ""But I felt a void. My voice pushed to resurface,"" she recalls.
In 2015, she set herself the challenge of singing with 101 traditional Rhodope bagpipes, the ""kaba gaida"" -- and her voice held its own.
Svetla Stanilova, head of the Plovdiv Conservatory of Music, recognised Zaharieva’s ""amazing vocal abilities"" and ""exceptional register"".
""The loudness of the voice is an individual quality but it is not the most important one... beauty depends on the voice’s timbre,"" explains Stanilova, one of several experts present at the Guinness World Records attempt.
""From all the 26 classes that I’ve taught, I haven’t heard another folklore voice with a similar range.""
Sofia opera director Plamen Kartaloff was more Skeptical on the record: ""What a funny idea to measure one’s voice!"" he said, adding several opera singers known for their voices -- perhaps more powerful than Zaharieva’s -- never had theirs measured.

Keen on yoga and interested in Eastern meditation techniques, Zaharieva wants to explore the curative effects of sound and is seeking to collaborate with other artists. She has already asked American pop-star Madonna.
""This voice that has been given to me, I want to use it to help people and find a message to convey,"" said the mother-of-two and recent grandmother of twins.
Zaharieva uses the crystal lyre instrument, known for its soothing, relaxing and meditative effects, and a chain of large bells -- ""chanove"" -- from the Rhodope mountains in sessions she both participates in and organises.

"'Lion King' fends off Tarantino, maintains box office rule","
LOS ANGELES (AFP) - Disney s ""The Lion King"" held on to its reign in North American theaters,  taking in $75.5 million over the three-day weekend, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations said on Sunday.
The healthy haul for the Disney production brought its total to $350.8 million and put it on top of the box office for the second week in a row, capping a streak of successes for the studio after its ""Avengers: Endgame"" was last week named the highest-grossing movie of all time and now has global box office earnings of $2.7924 billion.
Directed by Jon Favreau, ""The Lion King"" is a remake of the 1994 animated film, employing hyper-realistic computer-generated images with a voice cast including Donald Glover as Simba and Beyonce as Nala, together with Seth Rogen, Chiwetel Ejiofor and James Earl Jones.
Despite rave reviews, director Quentin Tarantino s ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood,"" came in a distant second place with $40.4 million.
The ninth of the 10 movies Tarantino has said he will make before retiring, ""Once Upon a Time"" is set in Tinseltown in 1969 and features an ensemble cast typical of the director s work, with Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Dakota Fanning and Al Pacino among the stars.
""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" came in third in its fourth week with $12.2 million. Continuing where ""Avengers: Endgame"" left off, the production by Sony and Disney s Marvel Studios is the latest installment in the blockbuster franchise, with Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man leading a cast that includes Samuel L. Jackson, Zendaya and Jake Gyllenhaal.
""Toy Story 4,"" came in fourth, taking in $9.9 million in its sixth week in cinemas, which have brought it more than $395.6 million in total.
The latest installment in the family-friendly Disney/Pixar animation franchise that began in 1995, the movie features the voices of Tom Hanks (Woody) and Tim Allen (Buzz Lightyear).
The fifth spot went to Paramount s ""Crawl,"" with $4 million in its third week. Barry Pepper and Kaya Scodelario play a father and daughter battling hungry gators after a hurricane hits their Florida town.

World's largest concert piano strikes chord in Latvia,"
VENTSPILS (AFP) - Soaring to new musical heights, a German-born innovator has crafted what is believed to be the world’s largest grand piano.
It is without question one of a kind: attached high on the wall of a concert hall in Latvia, the steel-framed vertical grand piano hangs as if in mid-air some three storeys above the audience.
To play it, pianists must climb a steep flight of steel stairs to a balcony.
Although the Guinness Book of World Records has not yet measured the new instrument, it was made by David Klavins whose Model 370 piano unveiled in 1987 is currently regarded as being among the world’s largest.
Klavins’ standard new model, the 470i Vertical Concert Grand piano, has strings that are 4.7 metres long.
The custom-built 470i piano installed at a new concert hall in the Baltic seaside port and resort town of Ventspils is even larger; its imposing navy blue-painted steel frame is six metres high.
With some strings measuring almost five metres, the instrument emits bold, sonorous music.
""The most suitable music for this instrument would be all the very expressive works, for example Rachmaninoff, Scriabin but also Beethoven’s sonatas would sound totally different on this instrument,"" Klavins told AFP.
The innovator, who has Latvian roots, has worked on pianos nearly all his life, driven by a desire to push the boundaries of the instrument first created by Italian Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700.

High school dropout 


""Since I was 16 years old and dropped out of school to become a piano restoration apprentice, I have been trying to explore new designs and principles, which deviate from the 140-year-old construction of the traditional grand piano,"" Klavins, now 65, told AFP while sitting at the 450i.
He crafted his first vertical piano in 1985. Now at his workshop, the Klavins Piano Manufaktura based in the town of Vac just north of the Hungarian capital Budapest, he dreams up his signature vertical designs.
It is not just his new instrument’s mammoth size that makes it stand out; having no wooden casing means that audiences seated in the concert hall can see its long, steely strings.
Laying them bare in this way lets music lovers ""hear every sound nuance unmuted,"" Klavins said.
Opening this Friday in Ventspils, the Latvija venue where the piano is installed, boasts two concert halls with a combined seating capacity of 1,000. It is also home to a music academy for emerging young talent.
""Traditional pianos are meant to be transported in and out of the concert venues, but my vertical design has to be mounted on the building’s structure,"" Klavins said.

Size matters 


""The size of the piano and length of strings do not set records for a record’s sake: the idea is to create the best imaginable sound for all the performers and listeners who come to this particular hall,"" he added.
On display to the public for the first time on Friday, the instrument has already created a buzz among piano enthusiasts.
""Composers and performers from all around are interested in playing the new Klavins piano, which will open new avenues of artistic expression for them,"" said Miks Magone, the creative head of the new concert venue.
Pianist Lubomyr Melnyk from Canada, known for a technique using an extremely rapid succession of notes, will be among the first to play the 450i next week, Magone said.
One of six German pianists will also use it in a performance of ""Six Pianos"" by Steve Reich, he added.
Ventspils Mayor Aivars Lembergs has his fingers crossed that the record-breaking piano will help the industrial port city of 40,000 rebrand itself into a family-friendly tourist destination.
""We’re hoping to attract foreign music lovers as well,"" he said. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-28-19/news_big_images/502448_97929471.jpg,entertainment,"On display to the public for the first time on Friday, the instrument has already created a buzz among piano enthusiasts.",neutral
"Russi Taylor, voice of Minnie Mouse, dies at 75","
LOS ANGELES (AFP) - Russi Taylor, Disney s official voice of Minnie Mouse for more than three decades, has died, the entertainment giant announced Saturday. She was 75.
Taylor, who was prone to giggles just like the character she voiced, captured the heart and sound of Mickey Mouse s counterpart on TV, in cartoons and film, and at theme parks.
""Minnie Mouse lost her voice with the passing of Russi Taylor,"" Bob Iger, chairman and chief executive of The Walt Disney Company, said in a statement.
""For more than 30 years, Minnie and Russi worked together to entertain millions around the world -- a partnership that made Minnie a global icon and Russi a Disney Legend beloved by fans everywhere.
""We take comfort in the knowledge that her work will continue to entertain and inspire for generations to come,"" Iger said.
Taylor died in Glendale, California on Friday, Disney said. The company did not give the cause of death.
Taylor had been Disney s pick from a group of 200 candidates at a 1986 audition.
The Massachusetts native said she actually met Walt Disney as a girl, on a visit to Disneyland.
""At one point during our chat, he asked me what I wanted to do when I grow up, and I said,  I want to work for you!  So he said,  Okay!  -- and now I do!"" she was quoted as saying in a profile released by Disney.
Life imitated art when Russi met her real-life Mickey in the 1980s: it was Wayne Allwine, who had voiced Mickey Mouse since 1977.
""Wayne was coming out of a session as Mickey for  Totally Minnie.  We met in the hallway. We just blended really well,"" Taylor told the LA Times in 2014.
They wed in 1991 but generally ""kept it quiet. We didn t want it to be about Mickey and Minnie being married. It was about Wayne and Russi being married. We had the best time. We laughed a lot. We were always singing. We always had music in the house.""
The duo stayed as close as their animated counterparts until Wayne s 2009 death.
""I really want whoever comes after us to be aware of the history and the tradition, and to love the characters as much as we do,"" she  said of herself and Allwine.
""I never wanted to be famous,"" she said. ""The characters I do are famous, and that s fine for me.""
In addition to Minnie Mouse and other Disney characters, Taylor was also the voice of Strawberry Shortcake and Pebbles Flintstone. She worked in television for decades, including on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and ""The Simpsons.""

South Korean chip giants face 'strangling' from Japanese export curbs,"
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean chipmakers are hitting a dead end in their quest to find alternatives for key Japanese materials that have been slapped with export restrictions, raising the prospect of major disruption to their operations in the coming months.
Japan is now requiring special approval for sales of three high-tech materials, including two that are critical for chipmaking, to South Korea amid a deepening diplomatic dispute over compensation for forced labor during World War II.
South Korea-bound exports of the materials, including hydrogen fluoride gas and chemicals known as photoresists, now require government approval. No approvals have been granted since the dispute broke in early July, South Korean industry sources said.
“Japan is slowly strangling our neck”, one senior official at a major South Korean major chipmaker told Reuters, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
South Korean chipmakers have been plotting workarounds, such as seeking supplies directly from factories in China or Taiwan owned by their Japanese suppliers, but government officials this week warned them not to go that route.
At a closed-door meeting on Monday, South Korea’s chip industry group handed out government guidelines to its members, including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix.
The guidance seen by Reuters cautioned that Japanese firms can rightly refuse to ship the materials from third countries, and that any efforts to bypass restrictions could subject both chipmakers and suppliers to broader international trade sanctions.
“Simply put, don’t sweat over importing Japanese materials,” said one official at the Korea Strategic Trade Institute who is not authorized to speak to media.

LIMITED ALTERNATIVES

Efforts to find alternatives to the Japanese suppliers have also struggled to make headway.
Although there have been offers from Russian and Chinese suppliers, chipmakers say that for most purposes they need Japan’s high-purity hydrogen fluoride because it helps them get high “yield” rates, which is critical to making chips profitably.
Yield is especially important in manufacturing memory chips, used in everything from smartphones to vehicles and where Samsung and SK Hynix control more than half of the global market.
“Even if we want to use products from other countries to replace Japanese, it will take months to prove them as suitable for our current manufacturing systems and performance,” a second official at a South Korean major chipmaker said, who also requested anonymity.
Major South Korean chipmakers are now testing some non-Japanese materials, South Korean deputy trade minister Kim Yong-rae told foreign media on Wednesday.
Samsung said Japanese curbs on the export of chip-making materials were blurring its business outlook as it reported a halving in quarterly profit on Wednesday.
“Even though the recent measures by the Japanese government do not ban export of materials, we are facing difficulties due to the burden of this new export approval process and uncertainties this process will bring, so the visibility is low,” Robert Yi, Samsung’s head of investor relations, said on an earnings call.
The company was reviewing various measures to minimize impact, he said, without providing further details.
The curbs on photoresists only apply to those used in producing chips based on an advanced technique known as extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography.
But that could hobble Samsung’s efforts to use the technology to catch up with rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd in the booming business of building advanced chips for other companies.
“If Japan’s exports controls continue further, Samsung will inevitably face long-term consequences operating its EUV machines and a hard time meeting their production agenda,” said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities.
South Korean chipmakers and their local suppliers are bracing for further moves by Tokyo to drop South Korea as a preferred trading partner, which would mean tighter regulations for a broader range of chip products bound for South Korea.
South Korea’s top imports from Japan by value last year were semiconductor components and equipment ranging from silicon wafers to chip etching machines, according to data provided by Korea International Trade Association.
In 2018, South Korea bought a total $11 billion worth of semiconductor parts and equipment from Japan, accounting for nearly 20% of Japanese imports, the data shows.
The South Korean government has launched a campaign to nurture local suppliers to counter Japan’s restrictions, but analysts and officials at suppliers say the goals are unrealistic.
“On top of local suppliers’ efforts, current nationwide efforts to localize high-tech materials will continue, but we cannot replace all materials by ourselves,” said an executive at a South Korean supplier for Samsung and SK Hynix.
“It will take a long time to get there and we need to cooperate with Japan.”

Scientists find 'super-earth' that may be habitable ,"
(Web Desk ) – Just 31 light-years away, one of the closest worlds ever detected could harbour liquid water on its surface.
NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS – a super-powerful orbiting telescope that scouts the sky for alien worlds – spotted a new planet circling a nearby star in the Hydra constellation. When astronomers checked the star for confirmation, they discovered two more worlds orbiting it.
One of those planets, called GJ 357 d, could support liquid water if it turns out to have a thick atmosphere and be made of rock.
It’s among the 45 closest exoplanets confirmed to date, out of a total 4,025 planets tallied so far outside our solar system.
This planet system is the third-closest identified using the ""transit"" method, in which telescopes watch for tiny dips in a star’s brightness that could be caused by a planet passing in front of it. The Kepler telescope pioneered the technique, though it’s been refined by TESS.

The promising planet is in its star’s ""habitable zone"", the range of distances in which a rocky world could have the right surface temperature for liquid water to exist.
""GJ 357 d is located within the outer edge of its star’s habitable zone, where it receives about the same amount of stellar energy from its star as Mars does from the Sun,"" Diana Kossakowski, a member of the team that discovered the planet, said in a press release.
""If the planet has a dense atmosphere, which will take future studies to determine, it could trap enough heat to warm the planet and allow liquid water on its surface,"" Kossakowski said.
If the planet turns out to have no atmosphere, however, its surface would be about -64 degrees Fahrenheit (-53 degrees Celsius), well below water’s freezing point.
GJ 357 d’s mass is at least 6.1 times Earth’s, and the planet orbits its tiny star every 55.7 days. Scientists can’t say much about else about it without further study though.

TESS is only halfway done

TESS, NASA’s most powerful planet-hunting telescope ever, watches thousands of stars for transits.
The telescope observes one section of the sky for 27 days at a time, before moving on to a new patch. It divides each half of the sky (the northern half and the southern half) into 13 patches, as shown in the NASA graphic below. The spacecraft completed the southern half of its journey this month and turned to the northern sky.
When the mission ends around this time next year, TESS will have observed over 85 percent of the sky.
So far, the telescope has found over 850 potential new planets. The next step is for ground-based telescopes to examine the stars that these planets might be orbiting and detect whether the planets indeed exert a gravitational pull.
That process is what enabled researchers to find GJ 357 d. As they were working to confirm the planet that TESS spotted, they noticed gravitational pulls from two others. (TESS didn’t spot those two worlds because their orbits don’t pass between their star and the telescope.)

So far, only 24 of the exoplanets that TESS has spotted have been confirmed. Earlier this week, astronomers confirmed three nearby planets the telescope detected, including a ""super-Earth,"" though none is thought to have liquid water.
Scientists expect the telescope to identify thousands of exoplanet candidates before the mission ends. Some of those could be habitable, including GJ 357 d.
""The team is currently focused on finding the best candidates to confirm by ground-based follow-up,"" Natalia Guerrero, who manages the MIT team that identifies exoplanet candidates, said in a NASA press release last week.
""But there are many more potential exoplanet candidates in the data yet to be analysed, so we’re really just seeing the tip of the iceberg here.""

Facebook removes profile frame targeting Pakistan's Ahmadi community,"
ISLAMABAD (AFP) - Facebook said Wednesday it has removed a profile frame targeting Pakistan‘s Ahmadi community as the media giant continues to grapple with the proliferation of hate speech on the social network.
Profile frames are filters Facebook users can add to their pictures that often promote a cause, celebrate a holiday, or commemorate an event or tragedy.
The frame withdrawn by Facebook called for the death of the Ahmadis in Urdu and was widely shared in Pakistan.
""We have removed the Profile Frames in question for violating our rules, and have ensured that they are unavailable for future use,"" a Facebook spokesperson told AFP via email.
""We do not tolerate any content -- including anything shared within Profile Frames -- that incites violence, and we remove this content whenever we become aware of it.""
The frame was extensively used by Facebook users after US President Donald Trump met with several leading members of persecuted religious groups in the White House earlier this month, including a representative from Pakistan‘s Ahmadi community.
Facebook disabled 2.19 billion accounts in the first quarter of this year, nearly double the number of accounts nixed in the prior three-month period.
The social network took down four million posts considered hate speech in the first quarter of this year and continues to invest in technology to better detect such material in various languages and regions.
However Facebook has been battered by criticism that it was more focused on growth than protecting users or thwarting deception, bullying, and harassment. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-31-19/news_big_images/503061_60014517.jpg,Technology,The social network took down four million posts considered hate speech in the first quarter of this year and continues to invest in technology to better detect such material in various languages and regions.,neutral
Impaired patient plays video game using brain signals,"
ZURICH (Reuters) - Scientists in Switzerland have developed a system which allows people with severely-impaired motor functions, such as quadriplegia, to use video games using only the power of their brain.
Samuel Kunz, who was paralysed after an accident, uses the brain-computer interface to control an avatar through a race course in a specially-designed computer game called ‘Brain Driver’. The ultimate aim of the research is to develop technology to control devices such as wheelchairs for those with a limited ability to move.
Kunz, who is taking part in the trial, is able to ‘pilot’ the digital race-car using only his brain signals transmitted to a computer via electrodes placed on his head.

""These electrodes are connected to an amplifier and then to the computer and to our algorithms in the end. The algorithms are then calculating the brain signal and sending commands to the game that our pilot can actually control,"" Dr. Rea Lehner, a neuroscientist at ETH Zurich explained.
Lehner added Kunz is training his mind by imagining certain actions which are then translated into signals to control the race car. Thinking about moving his left hand makes the car turn left, thinking about moving his right hand turns the car right, and moving both together makes the car go straight. A fourth command - fully relaxing and clearing his mind - slows the car down.
Kunz said it has taken a lot of practise to train his mind to control the game; which will be made even more difficult in a stadium full of people. He will be among those taking part in a special championship next year called Cybathlon in which people with physical disabilities compete against each other using state-of-the-art technology.
""I have to be very concentrated. The connection between my fingers and my brain is not there anymore. I still try to move my fingers just in my head and so that needs a lot of concentration to do it exactly the same way every time,"" Kunz told Reuters during a training session in Zurich.
In the Cybathlon ‘Brain Driver’ event, four participants will compete in a race and will be able to see the position of their avatar and the competing avatars. The first participant to cross the finish line wins the race, with a time limit of four minutes. The inaugural Cybathlon was held in Zurich in 2016, with the next event scheduled for 2020.
ETH Zurich’s professor for neural control of movement, Nicole Wenderoth, explained that their biggest challenge is decoding the complex brain signals using non-invasive sensors.

Apple's quarterly profit falls as iPhone sales sputter,"
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple’s iPhone sales are still sputtering while the company tries to offset the decline by milking more money from digital services such as music.
The latest evidence of the iPhone’s waning popularity had been expected. Even so, the confirmation in Tuesday’s fiscal third-quarter earnings report underscored the challenges facing a company that has been riding the smartphone revolution for the past decade.
The iPhone’s downturn is the main reason Apple’s profit for the April-June period fell 13% to $10 billion.
The good news is Apple has several ways it can still make money from the 900 million iPhones in use today. Besides selling new models to current iPhone owners after the current devices eventually wear out, Apple has positioned itself to make billions of dollars more from music, video and gaming subscriptions, maintenance plans and commissions from apps selling their own wares on iPhones.
The bad news is that Apple has still been relying on the iPhone for more than half its revenue so this year, and the company hasn’t proven it can be as adept peddling digital services as it has been making sleek devices. For instance, Apple’s 4-year old music streaming service still lags Spotify. Apple is preparing to launch a video streaming service more than a decade after Netflix pioneered the concept.
And a recently opened U.S. Justice Department investigation is expected to look into whether Apple unfairly favors its own services and gouges others through its app store, raising the specter of changes that could further depress its revenue.
“Apple has become a victim of its own success and there also appears to be a lack of urgency,” Chatham Road Partners analyst Colin Gillis said. “Apple is still the iPhone company and it may always end up being the iPhone company.”
The lingering doubts hanging over Apple are one reason why Apple’s stock price remains well below its peak of $233.47 reached last October, even as the rest of the market has soared to record highs. The company’s shares gained 4% to $217.55 in extended trading after the release of its numbers for the April-June period.
The rally may have stemmed from another encouraging sign that emerged in the quarterly report. Apple’s total sales in China decreased by 4% in the quarter compared with a year ago, after plunging 25% during the first half of the company’s fiscal year. That dramatic improvement eased fears that the Trump administration’s trade war in China might trigger a consumer boycott of Apple’s products in the country in retaliation.
“We couldn’t be happier with the progress,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a Tuesday conference call. He credited both Apple’s own price cuts and economic stimulus programs rolled out by China’s government to counteract the effects of U.S. tariffs.
Worldwide revenue from iPhones during the quarter totaled $26 billion, a 12% decrease from the same time last year. It marks the third straight quarter of eroding iPhone sales, something that has only happened once before.
Apple is forecasting its total revenue for the July-September period will fall from last year, a sign that it is bracing for yet another drop in iPhone sales. That’s particularly striking because Apple typically gets a big boost from the release of new iPhone models in late September. But the mid-range projection of $62.5 billion of revenue for the period was better than the $60.9 billion anticipated by analysts, providing another sign of hope for investors betting on Apple’s resilience.
Even with the iPhone in decline, Apple remains a financial powerhouse. Total revenue grew 1% from last year to $53.9 billion.
The services division remains the biggest area of growth, with revenue surging 13% from last year to $11.5 billion in the past quarter. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-31-19/news_big_images/503035_29142713.jpg,Technology,"“Apple is still the iPhone company and it may always end up being the iPhone company.”

Chinese solar-powered unmanned aircraft makes maiden flight,"
BEIJING (Dunya News) – After two years of research and development, the Chinese solar-powered unmanned aircraft ""MOZI 2"" with independent intellectual property rights, successfully made its maiden flight at Moganshan airport in Deqing, east China’s Zhejiang Province on July 27, according to its producer OXAI Aircraft Co., Ltd. on Tuesday.
According to the Shanghai-based company, the aircraft, designed with a wingspan of 15 meters and solely powered by solar cells, can fly at a maximum altitude of 8,000 meters. It can cruise at a low speed for up to 12 hours during the night after charging in the sunlight for eight hours.

Tesla advances towards storing renewable energy,"
(Web Desk) – Tesla on Monday announced its largest battery product. Called Megapack, it’s designed to simplify the installation process for large energy-storage projects.
Each Megapack can store up to 3 megawatt hours of energy and convert up to 1.5 megawatts of energy from a direct current (DC) to an alternating current (AC) so homes can use it.
Tesla had previously used its industrial-size Powerpack batteries for large-scale projects, but says the Megapack has 60 percent more energy density.
A system of Megapacks is more cost-effective and can be installed faster than a fossil-fuel power plant, Tesla says, and the Megapacks can store energy generated by wind turbines or solar panels.
The electric-car and energy company will use Megapacks in a California installation operated by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and designed for use when demand for energy from local grids is greater than their supply.
""Battery storage is transforming the global electric grid and is an increasingly important element of the world’s transition to sustainable energy,"" Tesla said in a blog post on its website.
In 2017, Tesla used Powerpacks to install in Australia what it says is the world’s largest lithium-ion battery to support local energy grids. The project reduced costs by almost US$40 million during its first year, Tesla says.
Storage has come to account for an increasingly large percentage of Tesla’s energy business, which also includes solar panels. While solar installations have declined in recent years, installed storage-capacity has increased.

Mosquitoes carrying deadly brain virus found in Florida,"
(Web Desk) – Orange County, Florida, just released a public advisory warning that the Department of Health had found signs of the rare brain-infecting virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) in the area.
EEEV is a particularly rare infection - it tends to spread in remote, swampy areas far from human civilization. But when the disease does strike, it can be grave: Gizmodo reports that a bite from an infected mosquito can cause severe, fatal brain swelling in a matter of days.
Health Department officials found EEEV in a flock of sentinel chickens, which local governments use to monitor and track infectious diseases, according to the warning, which included a list of steps people can take to prevent mosquito populations from growing.
If the sentinel chickens are getting bit, that means human infections could follow close behind, according to Gizmodo.
Unfortunately, mosquito-borne illness will likely spread farther into human-populated areas as our planet continues to heat up through climate change.
While EEEV is rare and human infections that lead to dangerous symptoms are even rarer, scientists have yet to figure out a vaccine or treatment for the disease, posing a problem for our warmer future.

"Planetary Society expected to announce something ""major"" about solar sailing","
(Web Desk) – The Planetary Society has been busy recently. On June 25, its LightSail 2 launched into orbit; just last week on July 24, the craft opened its sails successfully, a key stage of its mission to demonstrate solar sailing in practice.
And now, the nonprofit foundation has released a statement, revealing that today (July 31), there is going to be a major announcement about LightSail 2; sounds like it could be something really exciting.
The small LightSail 2 spacecraft is a crowd-funded endeavour, built to demonstrate controlled solar sailing - a promising method of propulsion that doesn’t require fuel.
Instead, the craft hosts a large sail made out of a reflective material for photons emitted by the Sun to ‘bounce’ off of.

Although photons - light particles - don’t have mass, they do have momentum, and the hypothetical principles behind solar sails state that in the vacuum of space, even this small momentum can push the spacecraft forward.
So far, so good: LightSail 2 is currently drifting 720 km (420 miles) above Earth’s surface, and over the next month the craft is expected to adjust its elliptical orbit by using the solar sail.
This is already exciting, but tomorrow at 5 pm UTC we can expect to hear a potentially major announcement from Bill Nye, the CEO of The Planetary Society, as well as three other scientists working for the foundation.
So far, it’s anybody’s guess what that announcement might bring; we’ve already received some stunning pictures of the solar sail deploying, so it won’t be that.

Facebook fact-checker says company must share more data to fight misinformation,"
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - One of Facebook’s third-party fact-checking partners on Tuesday said the company needed to share more data with fact-checkers to better curb misinformation.
UK-based charity Full Fact, which joined the programme in January, issued a report urging Facebook to provide more data on how flagged content is shared over time, to see how quickly false information is spreading and assess how fact-checks are containing the spread.
The charity, which said it had earned $171,800 from fact-checking Facebook content between January and June, also raised concerns about the effectiveness of Facebook’s machine-learning approaches for identifying potentially false content.
Facebook launched the programme in December 2016 and now has 54 fact-checking partners working in 42 languages.
Under the system, fact-checking partners rate content with labels and Facebook then downgrades the distribution of certain items. Facebook also adds fact-checkers’ articles to a story’s “Related Articles” and notifies users if they try to share or have previously shared a false story.
Julia Bain of Facebook’s integrity partnerships team said the social media network was evolving its rating scale to account for different types of misinformation and working on improving the impact of fact-checks by identifying similar or identical content.
“We are encouraged that many of the recommendations in the report are being actively pursued by our teams,” Bain said in a statement to Reuters.
Although Full Fact said it still thought the programme was worthwhile, it echoed statements from other partners that Facebook was not sharing enough data that they could use to evaluate their fact-checks.
Eugene Kiely, director of FactCheck.org, recently told Reuters that he “couldn’t make heads or tails” of a report the organisation received last December.
“We haven’t really received anything from Facebook that would provide evidence one way or the other to the effectiveness,” he added.
A Facebook spokeswoman told Reuters that fact-checking partners receive quarterly reports.
Full Fact also called for the programme to be expanded to Instagram, so that fact-checkers could directly check content on the platform. In May, the company started using image-detection to find content debunked on Facebook and removing it from Instagram’s Explore tab and hashtag search results.

"Huawei outsells smartphone rivals in China, tightens market grip amid US spat","
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China’s Huawei Technologies cemented its dominance of the domestic smartphone market in the second quarter, with shipments and market share rising, as Chinese customers backed the embattled firm amid its trade fight with the United States.
Huawei, which was put on a trade blacklist by the United States since mid-May and was virtually barred from doing business there even earlier, shipped 37.3 million smartphones in China in the three months ended June, up 31% year-on-year, according to market research firm Canalys.
Its market share rose more than 10 percentage points to 38% in the quarter, even as all other top vendors lost ground in the world’s biggest smartphone market, the Canalys data showed.
Huawei was added by Washington to a so-called Entity List in May. The blacklisting has threatened to cut its access to essential U.S. components and software such as the Google Android apps.
The addition to the list “caused uncertainty overseas” but the firm has been shifting its focus towards its home market, where it invested in an aggressive offline expansion to lure consumers with a patriotic sales pitch, said Canalys analyst Mo Jia.
Calls to support Huawei have consistently surfaced on Chinese social media on comment threads trailing news on the company.
Kitty Fok, who tracks China’s smartphone sector at research firm IDC, said that consumers responded to the spat over Huawei with pro-China sentiment, which helped boost the brand’s already-strong appeal in the country.
“The product itself is already well-recognised, and the trade war helped people feel like they need to support Huawei. The only worry was that they might not get the component supply, but in the end, they did,” said Fok.
Huawei’s second-quarter smartphone shipments surged even as overall Chinese smartphone shipments shrank. Smartphone shipments in China declined by 6% in the quarter to 97.6 million units, the 9th consecutive quarterly fall, according to Canalys.
Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi Corp and Apple Inc, the top four vendors behind Huawei, saw declines in shipments and market share in the quarter, Canalys said.
The second-quarter China shipments represented 64% of Huawei’s total smartphone shipments in the quarter, it said.
“Clearly the international market is a risky one now, whereas in China, where the Android ecosystem is most mature, in terms of sales channels and software income, Huawei has clear advantage in price negotiation,” said Canalys analyst Jia. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-30-19/news_big_images/502862_80016861.jpg,Technology,"

EU court rules sites must warn about Facebook 'like' button,"
LUXEMBOURG (AFP) - Europe’s top court ruled Monday that online retailers must warn web users that they send personal data to Facebook through the ""like"" button.
According to the European Court of Justice ruling, a site that embeds the Facebook ""like"" icon and link on its pages also sends user data to the US web giant.
""It seems that that transmission occurs without that visitor being aware of it and regardless of whether or not he or she is a member of the social network Facebook or has clicked on the ‘Like’ button,"" it said.
Under EU data protection law, therefore, a European retailer and the US platform are jointly responsible for gathering the data and sending it to Facebook’s Irish subsidiary.
Users should therefore be warned and asked to consent to their data being gathered, although the retailer is not responsible for what Facebook does with it later.
""As a result of this case, companies that embed this ‘like’ button on their website cannot hide behind Facebook any longer,"" said Monique Goyens, of the European Consumer Organisation.
""The decision therefore underlines the right for internet users to always get information on what data are collected and how they are used by websites,"" she said.
The case was brought by a German consumer protection agency against online clothes site Fashion ID, which embeds a Facebook button to encourage shoppers to publicise its wares.
Bitkom, a German trade federation for online businesses criticised the ruling, saying it would heap costly bureaucracy on firms without enhancing consumer protection.
""With its decision, the ECJ places enormous responsibility on thousands of website operators -- from small travel blogs to online megastores and the portals of large publishers,"" Bitkom CEA Bernard Rohleder said.

Google builds gesture controls into new Pixel phone,"
SAN FRANCISCO (AFP) - Google on Monday revealed that it is building gesture controls and face recognition into a next-generation Pixel smartphone as it looks to fuel early enthusiasm for its upcoming flagship handset.
The Pixel 4 is expected to make its debut in October, along with a new iPhone as competitors strive to win or keep fans in the competitive, cooling smartphone market.
The two new Pixel features teased by Google were billed as representing a ""next step"" in the internet giant’s vision for a future in which computing power is available anywhere when people want without having to think about it.
Alphabet-owned Google said the key technology would center around its motion-sensing radar called ""Soli.""
""Pixel 4 will be the first device with Soli, powering our new motion sense features to allow you to skip songs, snooze alarms, and silence phone calls, just by waving your hand,"" Pixel product manager Brandon Barbello said in an online post.
""These capabilities are just the start, and just as Pixels get better over time, motion sense will evolve as well.""
Google’s advanced technology and projects team has worked on Soli, a motion-sending radar, for the past five years, according to Barbello.
Along with recognizing hand gestures, Soli will cue facial recognition sensors when a Pixel 4 is picked up to allow devices to automatically unlock for their owners.
""Face unlock uses facial recognition technology that is processed on your device, so that image data never leaves your phone,"" Barbello said.
""The images used for face unlock are never saved or shared with other Google services.""
Soli sensor data is also kept on smartphones and not shared with other Google services, according to Barbello.
Google, Apple and other smartphone rivals typically launch new premium models ahead of the year-end holiday shopping season. A Samsung event in early August is expected to reveal its new Note handset.

Riskiest time for surgery patients is not in the operating room,"
(Reuters Health) - The deadliest time for many surgery patients isn’t when they’re on the operating table, it’s while they’re recovering in the hospital and after they go home, a new study suggests.
For the study, researchers examined outcomes for more than 40,000 patients 45 and older who underwent non-cardiac surgery at 28 hospitals in 14 countries. Researchers monitored patients for complications and deaths within 30 days of surgery.
Overall, five people, or less than 1% of patients, died in the operating table, and another 500 patients, or 70%, died in the hospital. Another 210 deaths, or 29%, didn’t happen until after patients were sent home.
Nearly half of all the deaths were associated with three complications: major bleeding, heart damage, and bloodstream infections.
“Many families anxiously wait to hear from the surgeon whether their loved one survived the operation, but our research demonstrates that very few of the deaths occur in the operating room,” said Dr. P.J. Devereaux, senior author of the study and director of the Division of Perioperative Care at McMaster University in Canada.
“Our research now demonstrates that there is a need to focus on postoperative care and transitional care into the home setting to improve outcomes,” Devereaux said by email.
Worldwide, 100 million patients age 45 and older undergo inpatient surgery unrelated to cardiac issues every year, researchers note in CMAJ.
A wide range of technological and medical advances have made surgery safer and less invasive in recent years, the study team notes. But at the same time, patients also are coming to the hospital sicker and being sent home with complex care needs that once would have meant a lengthy hospital stay.
In the study, roughly half of the patients had high blood pressure, one in five had diabetes, and 13% had coronary artery disease.
More than one-third of them came in only for low-risk procedures that were not emergencies. Many of the rest had major general, orthopedic, urological, gynecological, vascular or neurological operations.
Patients who experienced major bleeding after surgery were more than twice as likely to die within 30 days as people who didn’t have this complication.
And patients who developed heart injuries even though they didn’t have heart surgery were also more than twice as likely to die.
Patients who got sepsis, a serious bloodstream infection, were more than five times more likely to die within 30 days than people who didn’t get these infections.
The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to identify which if any complications actually caused any deaths.
Inflammation may be a common denominator in the complications that were most responsible for deaths, said Barnaby Charles Reeves of the University of Bristol in the U.K., author of an editorial accompanying the study.
“Surgery causes a body-wide inflammatory reaction,” Reeves said by email. “This can lead to single or multi-organ failure (kidney, heart, lungs, sepsis etc.) which leads to death.”
Patients may also not recognize that something is wrong when they’re coming off anesthesia or taking narcotic painkillers after surgery, Devereaux said.
“This makes patients after surgery vulnerable to delays in recognizing complications and hence delays in treatment,” Devereaux said.
Surgery also activates patients’ inflammatory, stress, and coagulation systems. The activation of these systems can also predispose patients to major complications. Patients should advocate and support research into enhanced monitoring techniques after surgery, which can help sort out identifying ways to lower the risk of death after surgery.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-30-19/news_big_images/502760_13914664.jpg,Technology,And patients who developed heart injuries even though they didn’t have heart surgery were also more than twice as likely to die.,neutral

Companies using Facebook 'Like' button liable for data: EU court,"
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Companies that embed Facebook’s “Like” button on their websites allowing users’ personal data to be transferred to the U.S. social network can be held liable for collecting the data, Europe’s top court said on Monday.
Website plugins are a common feature of online retail as companies seek to promote their products on popular social networks, but critics fear the data transfer may breach privacy laws.
The ruling from the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) came after a German consumer body sued German online fashion retailer Fashion ID for breaching personal data protection rules via its use of the button on its site.
A German court subsequently sought guidance. ECJ judges said websites and Facebook share joint responsibility.
Under EU data privacy rules, a data controller determines why personal data must be collected and processed, as well as how, while a data processor only processes personal data on behalf of the controller and is usually a third-party company.
“The operator of a website that features a Facebook ‘Like’ button can be a controller jointly with Facebook in respect of the collection and transmission to Facebook of the personal data of visitors to its website,” the judges said.
The German retailer benefited from a commercial advantage as the ‘Like’ button made its products more visible on Facebook, the court said, though it noted the company is not liable for how Facebook subsequently processes the data.
Facebook said the ruling sheds clarity on the issue.
“We are carefully reviewing the court’s decision and will work closely with our partners to ensure they can continue to benefit from our social plugins and other business tools in full compliance with the law,” Jack Gilbert, Facebook’s associate general counsel, said in a statement.
The ruling is in line with strict data privacy laws adopted by the 28-country bloc last year, said Nils Rauer, a partner at law firm Pinsent Masons.
“The court was right in assessing whether Fashion ID had an interest in collaborating with Facebook by way of embedding the ‘Like’ Button,” Rauer said, adding plugins will continue to be popular notwithstanding the judgment.
“Personally, I do not think that companies will turn away from embedding ‘Like’ buttons due to the judgment. Presumably, they will pay more attention to the embedding process, by way of obtaining dedicated data privacy advice,” Rauer said. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-29-19/news_big_images/502655_56644122.jpg,Technology,"
