The veteran politician, the oldest head of state after Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II, came to power in 2014, three years after the Arab Spring uprising toppled longtime despot Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and sparked revolts in several Arab nations.
He had been hospitalised with a severe illness in late June and was returned to intensive care on Thursday. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-25-19/news_big_images/502038_92028919.jpg,world,"

Bombardment kills 20 civilians in northwest Syria: monitor,"
BEIRUT (AFP) - Bombardment by the Syrian regime and its Russian ally killed 20 civilians including five children Wednesday in the latest violence to hit northwest Syria.
The Syrian regime and Russia have stepped up their deadly raids on the Idlib region since late April, despite an international deal intended to prevent a full-scale offensive on the area of some three million people.
Almost 730 civilians have been killed there in air strikes and ground-to-ground fire by the Damascus government and its allies in the same period.
The bombardment has also hit two dozen hospitals in the opposition area, which is made up of most of Idlib province as well as slivers of adjacent governorates.
On Wednesday, Russian air strikes killed 10 people from the same family, including three children, on a farm near the town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib province, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
Ten others lost their lives in regime air strikes and artillery fire in other parts of the jihadist-run bastion, the Britain-based monitoring group said.
Among these, regime war planes killed five civilians including two children in the town of Ariha in Idlib province, it said.
A rescue worker in the town lifted the limp body of a toddler out of the rubble and rushed the child to an ambulance, according to footage shared by his White Helmets organisation.
His team members hurriedly worked through the debris and twisted sheets of corrugated iron, finding a young man on his back covered in grey dust -- but still alive.
Also on Wednesday, opposition rocket fire killed two children in the northern regime-held city of Aleppo, state news agency SANA said.
According to the Observatory, rebel and jihadist fire from the Idlib region on adjacent government-held territory has killed 70 civilians since late April.
On Monday, air strikes killed at least 50 civilians in various parts of the bastion.
The Observatory said the majority were killed in Russian air raids on a busy market, but Moscow has denied any involvement.
The monitor, which relies on sources inside Syria, says it determines who carries out air strikes according to flight patterns, as well as aircraft and ammunition involved.
Mark Cutts, UN deputy regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis, this week described a worsening ""nightmare"" unfolding in Idlib.
He said Monday s aerial onslaught was ""one of the deadliest attacks on civilian areas that we have seen since the upsurge in fighting"".
The Idlib region has since January been administered by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham -- a group led by Syria s former Al-Qaeda affiliate -- but other jihadists and rebels are also present in the area bordering Turkey.
A September accord struck between Moscow and Ankara was supposed to set up a buffer zone around the region, but it was never fully implemented after jihadists refused to withdraw from that planned security cordon.
The recent violence has forced more than 330,000 people from their homes, the United Nations says, many seeking shelter further north in camps or olive groves along the Turkish border.
Syria s war has killed more than 370,000 people and displaced millions since it started in 2011 with a brutal crackdown on anti-government protests.

N. Korea fires two short-range missiles: Seoul,"
SEOUL (AFP) - North Korea fired two short-range missiles into the sea on Thursday, South Korea s Joint Chiefs of Staff said, after warnings from Pyongyang over military exercises between Washington and Seoul next month.
The North has warned the war games could affect the planned resumption of denuclearisation talks between Washington and Pyongyang.
The North fired the two missiles just after dawn, an official at South Korea s Joint Chiefs of Staff said, and they flew a distance of around 430 kilometres (260 miles) before falling into the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan.
""It s not clear whether Kim Jong Un oversaw the launch on site"", he said, referring to the North s leader.
A joint analysis of the weapons was underway with Washington, the official told AFP.
Tokyo said the launches did not reach Japanese waters, with Japan s defence minister calling Pyongyang s move ""extremely regrettable"".
""We have confirmed so far that they did not reach our country s territory or exclusive economic zone,"" Defence Minister Takeshi Iwaya told reporters.
Pyongyang last fired short-range missiles on May 9, which US President Donald Trump called ""very standard stuff"" that, he said, had not affected his relationship with the North s leader Kim Jong Un.
Kim and Trump agreed to a resumption of dialogue at an impromptu June 30 meeting they held in the Demilitarized Zone that divides the two Koreas.
Following that meeting, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said working-level talks would probably start in mid-July.
But last week, North Korea issued a warning over the military drills, which have been held for years and were scaled down to ease tensions with the nuclear-armed state.
The North condemned the exercises as ""blatant pressure"" and a ""violation of the spirit"" of the joint statement Trump and Kim signed at their first summit in Singapore last year.
The North even hinted it could reconsider its moratorium on nuclear testing because of the drills, although the US State Department had remained upbeat over commitments made by Kim and Trump during the DMZ encounter and at a February summit in Vietnam.
""The action should be considered part of Pyongyang s protest against the upcoming US-South Korea military drill next month,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, an analyst at the Sejong Institute.
But other analysts said opposition to the drills was merely a pretext for Pyongyang to pursue its weapons ambitions.
""I think today s launches are part of a larger plan for North Korea s advanced missile programme, rather than its protest against the upcoming military drill,"" said Hong Min, a senior researcher at the South s state-run Korea Institute for National Unification.
""The North has declared in the past it would modernise and improve its defence system.... The launches today are part of that development plan and I think the North had already planned the launches in advance"", he added.
Adam Mount, of the Federation of American Scientists, said the latest launch was a clear indication that ""North Korea s nuclear and missile arsenals are now routinely being improved, displayed, and tested.""
""The current bargain is: don t test nuclear warheads or long range missiles and the United States won t object or seriously try to stop it,"" Mount tweeted.
At their first summit in Singapore in June 2018 Trump and Kim adopted a vaguely worded statement on ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and agreed to ""establish new US-DPRK relations"".
But the failure to reach an agreement over relief from US sanctions, and what the North was willing to give in return, led to the collapse of the leaders  second summit in Hanoi.
Tensions rose in May, during the standstill in negotiations between Trump and Kim, when North Korea fired short-range missiles for the first time since November 2017.
""I don t consider that a breach of trust at all. And, you know, at some point I may. But at this point no,"" Trump said in an interview with Politico at the time.
Asked on Tuesday whether any meetings were scheduled with the North, Trump said: ""No, we just have a very good relationship. And probably they would like to meet and we ll see what happens.""
""There was a little correspondence recently, very positive correspondence with North Korea.""
He said there had been ""no nuclear testing, there s no missile testing, there s no nothing.""

British PM Johnson overhauls cabinet with Brexit hardliners,"
LONDON (AFP) - New Prime Minister Boris Johnson named Brexit hardliners to top posts on Wednesday, replacing most of the cabinet after vowing to get a new divorce deal with the European Union or leave without one by October 31.
The former London mayor has pledged to break the political deadlock that has left Britain in crisis and forced his predecessor Theresa May to delay Brexit twice.
But he faces opposition from within his own Conservative party and across parliament to his threat of a ""no deal"" exit, while EU leaders warn they will not renegotiate the divorce agreement they struck with May.
Within hours of taking office, Johnson signalled his new approach by replacing top ministers.
""We are going to fulfil the repeated promises of parliament to the people and come out of the EU on October 31, no ifs or buts,"" he declared outside Downing Street.
Watched on by his 31-year-old girlfriend Carrie Symonds, the 55-year-old leader said ""the doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters are going to get it wrong again"".
But he added that Britain would ""prepare for the remote possibility that Brussels refuses any further to negotiate and we are forced to come out with no-deal"".
Shortly after, he named Dominic Raab as foreign minister.
Raab has said he would support a suspension of parliament in order to push through a no-deal Brexit if necessary.
Johnson also named Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of an arch-Brexiteer faction of Conservatives, as leader of House of Commons, charged with guiding legislation through the chamber.
Johnson s supporters hail his wit and optimism, and say his unconventional approach can rescue Britain from its current limbo.
But he has only a wafer-thin working majority in parliament, and is a divisive figure among the wider public.
As a figurehead of the 2016 EU referendum, he was criticised for populist rhetoric and exaggerated claims.
Rivals now accuse him of having no real plan for Brexit, and of underestimating the implications of a disorderly divorce.
European Council president Donald Tusk was quick to congratulate Johnson, but added pointedly: ""I look forward to meeting you to discuss -- in detail -- our cooperation.""
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, whose country would be hardest hit by a ""no deal"" Brexit, was more blunt.
""Any suggestion that there can be a whole new deal and negotiated in weeks or months is totally not in the real world,"" he said.
Johnson has more support on the other side of the Atlantic.
US President Donald Trump was one of the first to congratulate Johnson on his victory saying he would be ""great"" and describing him as ""Britain Trump"".
The new Johnson government will be seeking to repair ties with Washington, after a rift caused by the leak of diplomatic cables criticising the White House.
Johnson was on Tuesday chosen to be leader of the governing Conservative party by its members, and was confirmed prime minister in a meeting Wednesday with Queen Elizabeth II.
His ascent is the culmination of a lifelong ambition for the politician who, with his jokes and absurd anecdotes, has enjoyed celebrity status in Britain for decades.
But his election with fewer than 100,000 votes from Conservative party members leaves him vulnerable to charges that he has no mandate to govern.
A YouGov survey Wednesday found his approval rating was just 31 percent among the public, and opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn challenged him to call an election.
Johnson has indicated he does not want a vote before he can deliver Brexit.
His first cabinet appointment was Sajid Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants, who has been moved from the interior ministry to become finance minister.
He replaces Philip Hammond, who quit hours earlier after repeatedly condemning Johnson s ""no deal"" threats and warning of the dire economic consequences if they are enacted.
He is one of several Conservative MPs who say they could bring down the government to stop Britain crashing out of the European Union.
Priti Patel, another fierce Brexiteer who had to resign from government in 2017 after holding unofficial meetings with top Israeli officials during a holiday there, was named as interior minister.
Gavin Williamson, who was sacked from the government earlier this year for allegedly leaking details of a deal involving Chinese company Huawei, becomes education minister.
Johnson also named Michael Gove -- whose betrayal scuppered his chances of taking over the leadership in 2016 -- as a cabinet enforcer, and gave his brother Jo a ministerial role in the departments of business and education.
Johnson had already named as a top adviser Dominic Cummings, a combative character who helped lead the victorious ""Vote Leave"" campaign in 2016.
In a short speech before tendering her resignation to the queen earlier, May wished Johnson ""every good fortune"".
A heckler shouted ""Stop Brexit"" as she stood with her husband Philip by her side, to which she retorted: ""I think not.""
Johnson s appointment was also disrupted by climate protesters, who briefly stopped his convoy heading to Buckingham Palace for his meeting with the queen.

Records tumble in Europe as heatwave bites,"
PARIS (AFP) - Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands recorded their highest ever temperatures as a European heatwave soared towards its peak on Wednesday, impacting rail transport and prompting a number of drownings with people taking to the water.
Cyclists in the Tour de France in southern France had to puff their way over the course in well over 30 degrees Celsius while in the Netherlands, farmers have been leaving their cows outside to sleep, rather than bringing them in at night.
Belgium registered an all-time high of 39.9 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) at the Kleine-Brogel military base, beating a record that dated back to June 1947.
In Germany the temperature soared to 40.5C (104.9F) in western Geilenkirchenthe, surpassing the previous record of 40.3 (104.5)
In the Netherlands, 38.8C at Gilze-Rijen, in the south, displaced a record dating back 75 years.
The second heatwave in less than a month has focused new attention on climate change and a host of French cities broke records on Tuesday. Wine capital Bordeaux hit 41.2C (106.16F) while the central city of Vichy climbed to 41.3C (106.3F).
Paris is facing its hottest day on Thursday with the French capital s 70-year-plus record of 40.4C (104.7F) forecast to fall. Cooler weather with rain was expected to provide relief from Friday.
""It s too much for us,"" said Sven Schenk, 29, a logistics worker from Germany who was visiting Paris. ""We re not looking forward to tomorrow! But we haven t changed our plans.""
Britain s Met Office predicted a chance that the UK temperature record of 38.5C (101.3F) which was recorded in Faversham, Kent, in August 2004, will also be exceeded on Thursday at the peak of the heat.
Britain s Network Rail said it was slowing down trains in response to the extreme weather.
French trains were also slowed down and the national rail operator SNCF advised travellers in the worst affected areas to delay journeys planned at the peak of the heatwave Thursday.
Thalys and Eurostar train services between Brussels, Paris and London were disrupted by a failure on an overhead power line, although it was not immediately clear if this was due to the heatwave.
A Eurostar train bound for London tore down part of the cable support just outside Brussels. The 600 passengers were eventually taken back to Brussels, the Belga news agency said.
Across the area affected by the unusually high heat, people tried to cool off in lakes and rivers.
In London, police were searching for three people who went missing in the River Thames while swimming while three people have drowned in Germany since Tuesday.
Dutch media said hundreds of pigs died when a ventilator failed at Middelharnis.
France s weather office said the scorching conditions ""require particular care, notably for vulnerable or exposed people"" with almost the entire country under an orange-level weather alert, the second highest level.
Paris in particular remains haunted by the early summer of 2003 when 15,000 deaths were blamed on the heat and the authorities were bitterly criticised for not mobilising fast enough.
""We need to take care of ourselves but above all others, especially those who are alone, and be able to detect the first symptoms of heatstroke,"" said Prime Minister Edouard Philippe.
Local authorities have placed restrictions on water usage in many areas due to drought-like conditions that have seen ground and river water levels fall dramatically.
This summer s second heatwave has amplified concerns in Europe that human activity is heating the planet at a dangerous rate.
The June 26-28 blast of heat in France was four degrees Celsius (7.2 Fahrenheit) hotter than an equally rare June heatwave would have been in 1900, the World Weather Attribution (WWA) team said this month.
One study by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology said the deadly, weeks-long heatwave across northern Europe in 2018 would have been statistically impossible without climate change.
Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who has highlighted the problem of global warming through school strikes, warned MPs at France s parliament of dire consequences if ""business as usual"" continues until 2030.

Top Khamenei aide says no talks with US under any circumstances,"
GENEVA/DUBAI (Reuters) - The top military adviser to Iran s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that Tehran would not negotiate with the United States under any circumstances, an apparent hardening of its position as the Gulf tanker crisis escalates.
The Swedish operator of a British-flagged oil tanker seized by Iran in the Gulf last week said it had been able to speak to crew members and all 23 of them were safe.
""We had direct contact with the crew on board the vessel last night by telephone and they re all okay and in good health and they re getting good cooperation with the Iranians on board,"" Stena Bulk spokesman Pat Adamson said.
The company said it had no evidence that the ship had been involved in a collision, one of the reasons Iran has cited for sending commandos to capture it last Friday.
The tough remarks by Khamenei s aide, Hossein Dehghan, a senior commander of Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards whose views are seen as reflecting those of Khamenei, appeared to take a firm line in response to Western proposals to beef up security in the Strait of Hormuz in the wake of the seizure of the ship.
Dehghan said Iran would take action if the status of the strait were altered, and that no country would be allowed to ship oil through it unless all countries can.
His remarks were reported by Al Jazeera television which did not supply direct quotes of an interview with him. He singled out the United Arab Emirates for criticism, saying it had become a base for attacks on Iran, and repeated earlier Iranian threats to attack all U.S. targets in the region in the event of war.
 

VOLATILE TIME

Dehghan s remarks appear to shift the Iranian position on talks with the United States. In the past Tehran has said talks are possible although Washington must lift all sanctions first and return to the nuclear deal it abandoned last year.
The Trump administration says the purpose of its sanctions is to force Iran to the negotiating table, and it is open to talks, but Iran must make the first move.
Earlier on Wednesday, Iran s pragmatist president, Hassan Rouhani, who has drawn fire from hardline clerical leaders for reaching the nuclear pact with world powers in 2015, said Iran was ready for ""just negotiations"" but not if they mean surrender.
Britain has called for a European-led naval mission to ensure safe shipping through the world s most important oil artery after Iran seized the Stena Impero last week. The United States is trying to rally support for a global coalition to secure Gulf waters, although allies have been reluctant to join a U.S.-led mission for fear of escalating confrontation.
France, Italy and Denmark gave initial support to the British plan. A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said Berlin was talking to Britain and France about the idea.
The Trump administration abandoned the nuclear deal last year arguing that it was too weak because it did not cover non-nuclear issues such as Iran s missile programme and its regional behaviour. Dehghan repeated Iranian assertions that its missile programme is non-negotiable.

Bombardment kills 18 civilians in northwest Syria,"
(AFP) – Bombardment by the Syrian regime and its Russian ally killed 18 civilians including five children in northwest Syria Wednesday, a monitor said, in the latest violence to hit the jihadist-run bastion.
The Syrian regime and its Russian ally have stepped up their deadly bombardment of Idlib province and adjacent areas in Aleppo and Hama provinces since late April.
Among those killed Wednesday were 10 civilians including three children, all from the same family, hit by Russian air strikes on a farm near the town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib province, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
Eight others including two children lost their lives in regime air strikes and artillery fire in other parts of the bastion of some three million people, the Britain-based monitor said.
The spike in violence since late April has killed around 720 civilians, according to the Observatory, which relies on sources inside Syria for its information.
More than 330,000 people have fled violence in the area over the past three months, the United Nations says.
On Monday, air strikes killed at least 50 civilians in various parts of the bastion.
Mark Cutts, UN deputy regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis, this week described a worsening ""nightmare"" unfolding in Idlib.
He described Monday s aerial onslaught as ""one of the deadliest attacks on civilian areas that we have seen since the upsurge in fighting"".
The Idlib region has since January been administered by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group led by Syria s former Al-Qaeda affiliate.
But other jihadists and rebels are also present in the area.
Syria s war has killed more than 370,000 people and displaced millions since it started in 2011 with a brutal crackdown on anti-government protests.

Boris Johnson becomes British PM with Brexit vow,"
LONDON (AFP) - Boris Johnson took over as Britain’s prime minister Wednesday, promising to pull his country out of the European Union on October 31 by any means necessary.
A day after winning the leadership of his Conservative party, the former London mayor and figurehead of the 2016 Brexit campaign formally replaced Theresa May.
His ascent is the culmination of a lifelong ambition for the blond-haired politician, who delights in playing the clown but now faces an immense challenge ahead. Johnson has promised to deliver Brexit in three months’ time but faces opposition in Brussels and has only a wafer-thin majority in the British parliament.
Beloved by many for his refusal to take life too seriously, he is accused by others of divisive rhetoric, a flexible approach to the truth and incompetence. Before he even took office, several pro-European ministers quit in protest at his threat to leave the EU without a divorce agreement to ease the split.
Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn challenged Johnson to call a snap general election, saying he has no mandate from the public to govern.
Although he won a landslide of Conservative party members, a YouGov survey Wednesday found Johnson’s approval rating was just 31 percent among the public.
Even his appointment was disrupted by climate protesters, who briefly stopped his convoy heading to Buckingham Palace to be nominated by Queen Elizabeth II.
Brexit challenge 
Johnson is expected to swiftly announce his new cabinet, and his first appointment proved predictably contentious.
He named as a top adviser Dominic Cummings, a combative character who helped lead the victorious ""Vote Leave"" campaign during the 2016 EU referendum.
May resigned after failing to get her plan for leaving the EU through parliament, forcing her to twice delay Britain’s departure date.
Johnson has vowed to renegotiate her deal or take Britain out of the bloc at the next deadline, October 31, without any agreement with Brussels.
But the EU refuses to reopen the text, while some of his own MPs have said they might even bring down the government rather than accept a damaging ""no deal"" exit.
May took over three years ago promising to deal with the ""burning injustices"" in society, but leaves behind a divided party, country and Brexit in doubt.
In a short speech in Downing Street, before tendering her resignation to the queen at the palace, she wished Johnson ""every good fortune"".
A heckler shouted ""Stop Brexit"" as she stood with her husband Philip by her side, to which she retorted: ""I think not.""
But she emphasised that Brexit should be done ""in a way that works for the whole United Kingdom"", amid fears a disorderly divorce could cause irreparable damage to ties between England, Northern Ireland and Scotland.
During his victory speech on Tuesday, Johnson urged Britain to ""ping off the guy-ropes of self-doubt and negativity"" and vowed to unite the country.
A source in his campaign team said he would build a diverse cabinet with more women and a record number of ethnic minority politicians.
Sajid Javid, the son of a Pakistani immigrants and currently May’s interior minister, has been widely tipped to take over as finance minister.
‘Britain Trump’ 
Brexit aside, the most immediate problem facing Johnson is a stand-off with Iran after Tehran seized a UK-flagged tanker in the Gulf last week.
The current foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, was Johnson’s rival for the leadership and is not expected to keep his job, although he may stay in cabinet.
May’s government also provoked the ire of US President Donald Trump this month with the leak of diplomatic cables criticising the White House.
Johnson has emphasised the importance of Britain’s relations with the United States.
And Trump was one of the first to congratulate Johnson on his victory saying he would be ""great"" and describing him as ""Britain Trump"".
Trump suggested Johnson would work together well with anti-EU figurehead Nigel Farage, whose Brexit Party has taken a big chunk of eurosceptic votes from the Conservatives.
Johnson has ruled out any electoral pact.

China-Russia joint exercise sends a message to Washington ,"
BEIJING (AFP) - An unprecedented joint China-Russia bomber patrol over disputed territory off the coast of South Korea and Japan was a ""massive development"" in their bid to challenge US influence in the region, analysts said Wednesday.
The joint patrol caused outcry from Washington’s two main allies in the region after both Tokyo and Seoul claimed a Russian plane violated their airspace.
Seoul said a Russian warplane twice entered South Korean airspace near the disputed Dokdo islets -- which Tokyo also claims and calls Takeshima -- and that it fired warning shots in return. Japan also said it scrambled fighter jets in response.
""It’s a big deal because it displays confidence that the air forces of the two nations can coordinate a patrol of this nature in ways that the region will almost certainly find destabilising,"" said Lyle Morris, senior policy analyst at RAND Corporation.
China and Russia have increasingly close ties and have conducted a number of joint military exercises, but this bears extra political significance for taking place over disputed islands which are a source of simmering diplomatic friction between Japan and South Korea.
Ahn Chan-il, a researcher in Seoul, told AFP the violation of the disputed airspace was ""deliberate"".
""China and Russia are seeking to counterbalance Washington when it comes to North Korea’s nuclear issues,"" he told AFP.
""(They) are causing trouble in order to gain dominance in the region by provoking Washington’s two key allies.""
Both Moscow and Beijing have denied the exercise targeted other countries or violated disputed airspace, but the move was a bold one, say analysts, which targeted the region’s two main US allies at the same time.
Adam Ni, China researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney, said it was also significant that the bombers involved -- two Chinese H-6Ks and two Russian Tu95s -- were nuclear-capable, ""so it’s sending an additional message"".
""I think that is a fairly massive development in terms of the regional security landscape,"" he said.

‘Challenge to the US’

Trade between Moscow and Beijing was up 25 percent in 2018 to hit a record $108 billion, and Chinese President Xi Jinping described Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin as his ""best friend"" at a June meeting.
But analysts say the cooperation is moving beyond economic ties towards a wider partnership to upset the status quo.
""It also signals that Russian-PRC jointness has reached sufficient maturity that they can now conduct joint patrols,"" said J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior fellow with the Global Taiwan Institute in Washington.
""This, in my view, constitutes a direct challenge to the US alliance system in the Indo Pacific.""
The joint patrols also came a day before China unveiled its national defence plan, in which it spoke of the need to develop alternative military capabilities beyond sheer manpower.
China has the biggest army in the world and has the second-highest spending after the US, but the plan said warfare was evolving towards ""intelligent"" combat, citing a growing use of artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing and new high-tech military technologies.
Senior Colonel Wu Qian, a Beijing defence ministry spokesman, said the joint exercises would ""push the Sino-Russian military relations in the new era to a new historical height"".
But the partnership between the two is not necessarily easy.
Ni said that while the two powerhouses ""in a way still do not trust each other"", they have a ""have a common perceived security challenge in the United States"".
Analysts expect to see more joint operations in the future.
""This is also a natural offshoot of growing joint military exercises between Russia and the PRC in recent years,"" said Cole.
""It says, ‘if the US, Japan and ROK (South Korea) can do such things, why not us’?""",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-24-19/news_big_images/501852_12862153.jpg,world,"

UN nuclear watchdog to start search for new chief,"
VIENNA (AFP) - The UN’s nuclear watchdog has announced it will meet Thursday to start the hunt for a new director general to replace Yukiya Amano, who died last week.
The post of head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is particularly important as international tensions run high over Iran’s nuclear activities.
Among the names circulating to succeed Amano are Romania’s Cornel Feruta, one of his closest collaborators and currently the agency’s chief coordinator; and Rafael Grossi, Argentina’s ambassador to the IAEA.
The IAEA said Wednesday that the special meeting of the board of governors would also choose an interim chief, given the lengthy process needed to pick a permanent replacement.
Japanese diplomat Amano, who had led the agency since December 2009, died last week at the age of 72. No details were released about the cause of death, but he had been ill for several months.
His third term as IAEA chief had originally been due to expire in November 2021, but he had been set to announce his intention to step down early because for health reasons.
The agency is currently confronted with the unravelling of the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, which began when US President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled out of the agreement in May 2018.
The IAEA is tasked with monitoring Iran’s nuclear activities to ensure they abide by the terms of the deal.

BEIJING (AFP) - China on Wednesday defended a joint air force exercise with Russia that triggered a furious response from regional US allies South Korea and Japan over a perceived airspace violation.
The incident erupted on Tuesday when a Russian A-50 early warning and control plane violated airspace over the Dokdo islands, Seoul said. The islands are also claimed by Tokyo.
South Korea scrambled fighter jets, which fired nearly 400 warning shots at the alleged intruder.
The Chinese and Russian warplanes ""strictly abided by the relevant regulations of international law and did not enter the airspace of other countries"", defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian told a news conference in Beijing.
He did not mention an A-50, the Russian plane Seoul said violated its airspace.
Moscow has also denied any airspace violations by the long-range bombers -- two Russian Tu-95s and two Chinese H-6Ks -- which Beijing said flew over the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan in the first joint patrol by the two nations in the Asia-Pacific region.
The patrol aimed to deepen the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia, enhance joint operation capabilities of their armed forces, and ""jointly safeguard global strategic stability"", Wu said.

China warns of war in case of move toward Taiwan independence,"
BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s defense ministry warned on Wednesday that it was ready for war if there was a move toward Taiwan’s independence, accusing the United States of undermining global stability and denouncing its arms sales to the self-ruled island.

This month, the Pentagon said the U.S. State Department had approved sales of weapons requested by Taiwan, including tanks and Stinger missiles estimated to be worth about $2.2 billion.

China responded by saying it would impose sanctions on U.S. firms involved in such a deal.

China would make its greatest effort for peaceful reunification, defense ministry spokesman Wu Qian said.

“However, we must firmly point out that seeking Taiwan independence is a dead end,” Wu told a news briefing on a national defense white paper, the first in several years to outline the military’s strategic concerns.

“If there are people who dare to try to split Taiwan from the country, China’s military will be ready to go to war to firmly safeguard national sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity,” he said.

The United States is the main arms supplier to Taiwan, which China deems a wayward province. Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.

Washington has no formal ties with democratic Taiwan, but is bound by law to help provide it with the means to defend itself.

The Chinese defense document said the United States had “provoked intensified competition among major countries, significantly increased its defense expenditure ... and undermined global strategic stability.”

China’s defense spending would maintain moderate and steady growth, but it was relatively low, compared to other major countries, it added.

“There is still a wide gap between China’s defense expenditure and the requirements for safeguarding national sovereignty, security, and development interests,” it said.

Reports of a secret pact with Cambodia granting China’s armed forces exclusive access to part of the southeast Asian nation’s Ream Naval Base on the Gulf of Thailand were not in accordance with the facts, Wu added.

“China and Cambodia have in the past carried out positive exchanges and cooperation on military drills, personnel training and logistics,” he said. “This kind of cooperation does not target any third party.” ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-24-19/news_big_images/501825_29082195.jpg,world,"

South Korea asks Japan to cancel plan to remove the country from white list,"
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Wednesday a Japanese plan to remove South Korea from a Japanese list of countries that face minimum trade restrictions would undermine their decades-old economic and security cooperation and threaten free trade.

Japan’s planned revision of a law to take South Korea off its so-called white list comes amid a deepening row over compensation for wartime forced labor, and after Japan tightened curbs this month on exports to South Korea of high-tech materials used for making memory chips and display panels.

South Korea’s industry ministry said in a statement Japan’s removal of South Korea from the white list would be a very grave matter that would undermine the economic and security partnership between the two countries. It asked Japan to scrap its plan.

“It is a very grave matter that shakes the foundation of South Korea-Japan economic partnership and Northeast Asian security cooperation that has been maintained and developed for more than 60 years,” Sung Yoon-mo, the South Korean industry minister, told a briefing.

“Removal of South Korea from the white list of countries is against international norms and we are worried about its serious negative impact on global value chains and free trade,” Sung said.

Japan has threatened to drop South Korea from the white list of countries that face minimum trade restrictions under a trade control law. That would require Japanese exporters to seek a license for items that could be used in some weapons-related applications.

On Japan’s white list are 27 countries, from Germany to South Korea, Britain and the United States.

Japan will decide on the revision after pooling public opinions. The deadline for the hearing of public opinions was July 24.
South Korea’s industry ministry had sent an email including its request to shelve the plan to the Japanese government, a ministry official said.

Iran warns new British PM it will 'protect' Gulf waters,"
TEHRAN (AFP) - Iran warned Britain s next prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday that it will ""protect"" waters of the oil-rich Gulf, amid a standoff between the two countries over the seizure of tankers.
In the face of rising hostilities with the United States, Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on Friday impounded a tanker sailing under the flag of US ally Britain.
The seizure of the Stena Impero has been seen as a tit-for-tat move after British authorities detained an Iranian tanker on July 4 in the Mediterranean on suspicion it was shipping oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions.
""I congratulate my former counterpart, @BorisJohnson on becoming UK PM,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted after Johnson beat his rival, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, in a vote by party members.
""Iran does not seek confrontation. But we have 1500 miles of Persian Gulf coastline. These are our waters & we will protect them.""
Iran has impounded the Stena Impero at its port of Bandar Abbas for allegedly breaking ""international maritime rules"".
In new footage aired by Iranian state television, the crew of 18 Indians, three Russians, a Latvian and a Filipino are seen sitting around a table and seemingly going about their daily routines.
""Throughout history, Iran has been and will be the main guardian of security and free navigation"" in the Gulf, President Hassan Rouhani said late Monday, adding that Tehran was not seeking to stoke tensions.
The head of Iran s navy, Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi, said in an interview published Tuesday that his forces use drones to closely observe ""all enemy ships"" going through the Gulf, ""especially America s"".
Since the US began reimposing sanctions on Iran, tensions have mounted with drones shot down and tankers mysteriously attacked in sensitive Gulf waters.
At the height of the crisis, US President Donald Trump called off air strikes against Iran at the last minute in June after the Islamic republic downed a US drone.
Iran also said Monday it had arrested 17 suspects and sentenced some to death after dismantling a CIA spy network -- claims Trump dismissed as ""totally false"".
Tehran has been at loggerheads with Washington and its allies since May 2018, when Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal.
Iran said it would attend a meeting in Vienna this weekend with countries still party to the troubled accord.
The meeting was requested by the European parties to discuss the ""new situation"", Iran said, referring to its reduced nuclear commitments under the deal in response to the US withdrawal.
The EU confirmed Iran would meet envoys from the remaining parties -- Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia -- on Sunday.
Tehran has already given up on complying with some of the deal s limits on its nuclear programme in retaliation for the US withdrawal and what it sees as the failure of other parties to help it circumvent sanctions.
Iran s deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi travelled to France to deliver a message from Rouhani to his counterpart Emmanuel Macron, his ministry said.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian confirmed he met the envoy who brought a message from Tehran.
""We are now pushing Iran back into the Vienna agreement,"" he said, referring to the nuclear deal.
""I met earlier with President Rouhani s special envoy to tell him that,"" Le Drian added.
The latest efforts come after Macron s top diplomatic adviser Emmanuel Bonne visited Iran and met with senior officials earlier this month to ""piece together a de-escalation"" strategy.
The 2015 deal curbed Iran s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.
But on May 8 -- a year after the US withdrawal -- Iran said it would disregard certain limits on the programme as it was not receiving any benefits.
Iran has threatened further measures if the remaining parties to the deal fail to help it circumvent US sanctions, especially to sell its oil.
It has since exceeded the deal s limits on its enriched uranium and heavy water stockpiles, as well as passing a cap on its uranium enrichment.
The 4.5 percent enrichment level it reached is well below the more than 90 percent required for a nuclear warhead.
Iran has yet to specify what other steps it may take, and has repeatedly emphasised its actions can be reversed ""within hours"" if European partners deliver on commitments.
Meanwhile, China described as ""illegal"" US sanctions imposed on its companies as part of Washington s campaign against Iran.

"Turkey, US open talks on Syria buffer zone","
ISTANBUL (AFP) - Turkey and the US began talks on Tuesday to establish a ""security zone"" in northern Syria aimed at creating a buffer between Kurdish fighters and the Turkish border.
""Military officials from the two countries began, today in Ankara, to work together on a security zone that will be put in place in a coordinated manner in the north of Syria,"" the Turkish ministry of defence said in a statement.
It said further talks were due in the coming days.
The idea was first mooted by US President Donald Trump in January, in a call with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at a moment when Turkey was threatening to launch an offensive against Kurdish forces in Syria.
The US has provided extensive support to the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in Syria, who have shouldered the brunt of fighting against the Islamic State group.
In recent days, Turkey has renewed threats to attack the YPG, which it sees as a terrorist group with direct ties to Kurdish separatists in Turkey.
It has launched two previous offenses into Syria against IS and the YPG, in 2016 and 2018 respectively.

UAE not leaving war-torn Yemen despite drawdown: minister,"
DUBAI (AFP) - The United Arab Emirates has said it is not leaving Yemen despite a redeployment of its forces in the war-torn country, as Huthi rebels said they were ready to stop attacks on Saudi Arabia.
The UAE is a key partner in a Saudi-led military coalition which intervened in Yemen in 2015 to back the internationally recognised government of President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi against Iran-aligned Huthi rebels.
Earlier this month it said it was redeploying and reducing troops across Yemen and moving from a ""military-first"" strategy to a ""peace-first"" plan.
""Just to be clear, the UAE and the rest of the coalition are not leaving Yemen,"" UAE minister of state for foreign affairs Anwar Gargash said in an op-ed published Monday in The Washington Post.
""While we will operate differently, our military presence will remain. In accordance with international law, we will continue to advise and assist local Yemen forces.""
Gargash said Huthis should see the UAE move as a ""confidence-building measure to create new momentum to end the conflict"".
""As the United Arab Emirates draws down and redeploys its forces in Yemen, we do so in the same way we began -- with eyes wide open,"" he said.
""There was no easy victory and there will be no easy peace. But now is the time to double down on the political process.""
The warring sides have fought to a stalemate, and several rounds of UN-sponsored talks, the last held in Sweden in December, have failed to implement any deal to end the war.
Since 2015, tens of thousands of people -- mostly civilians -- have been killed in the conflict described by the United Nations as the world s worst humanitarian crisis.
The conflict has also seen the Huthis launch repeated attacks on Saudi Arabia, including at least 20 missile and drone strikes on the oil-rich kingdom in June alone.
Saudi advanced air defences successfully intercepted most of the strikes but failed to deal with some, including a drone attack on the vital airport of Abha, in the south, that killed one person and injured 21 others.
On Tuesday, the Huthis  top political leader Mahdi al-Mashat said the group was ready to stop attacks on Saudi Arabia and engage in a dialogue with it but on certain conditions.
""(We) are fully prepared to stop missile and air strikes if the enemy takes similar measures and facilitates the flow of basic aid through ports, and then we can begin a political process,"" he said, according to the Huthis  Saba news agency.
He also denied that the Huthis were ""puppets"" of Iran as purported by the United States and its Saudi and Emirati allies.
Mashat made the comments during a visit to Sanaa by Robert Malley, president of the International Crisis Group consultancy and a former adviser to US ex-president Barack Obama.
The visit by an American and think tank head to the rebel-held Yemeni capital is notably rare.
Malley, in a tweet, said he visited Sanaa as part of a trip that has already taken him to Aden, seat of Yemen s internationally recognised government, as ""part of our efforts to speak to all sides and help bring an end to the catastrophic Yemen war"".

Trump envoy says only direct talks can solve Israeli-Palestinian conflict,"
UNITED NATIONS (AFP) - President Donald Trump s Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt told the United Nations Security Council Tuesday that an ""international consensus"" cannot solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, only direct talks between the two.
Greenblatt, who is working with White House advisor Jared Kushner on a controversial peace plan, put the United States at odds with other council members by insisting that UN resolutions and international law were not the answer.
""This conflict will not end on the basis of an  international consensus  about who is right and who is wrong, about who should give up X and who should give up Y,"" he said.
""A comprehensive and lasting peace will not be created by fiat of international law or by these heavily wordsmithed, unclear resolutions,"" Greenblatt added.
Greenblatt and Kushner are due to return to the Middle East later this month as they push their two-fold economic and political plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
The trip will come around a month after Kushner convened an economic workshop in Bahrain that dangled the prospect of $50 billion in investment under a peace deal.
The Palestinian Authority boycotted the ""Peace to Prosperity"" workshop, accusing the unabashedly pro-Israel Trump of using the prospect of cash to try to impose political solutions, and of ignoring the fundamental issue of Israeli occupation.
Greenblatt said at Tuesday s Security Council meeting that Trump hoped to take a decision soon on when to release his administration s plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
""The vision for peace that we plan to present will not be ambiguous, unlike many resolutions that have passed in this chamber,"" he said.
Several council members emphasized the importance of UN resolutions during Tuesday s meeting.
British representative Karen Pierce said all countries ""have a responsibility"" to implement them, while German ambassador Christoph Heusgen reiterated his country s commitment to a negotiated two-state solution based on the internationally agreed parameters ""as the only viable solution"" to the conflict.
Greenblatt said a solution ""cannot be forced on the parties.""
""Let s be honest with ourselves, and the parties, and the region, that the only way ahead is direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians,"" he added.

Missiles 'probably' from Israel fired into south Syria: monitor,"
BEIRUT (AFP) - Missiles believed to have been launched by Israel were fired into south Syria on Wednesday morning, targeting military positions held by the government or its allies, a war monitor said.
""The missiles, probably Israeli"" were fired at the southern region close to the Golan Heights, an area occupied and annexed by Israel, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The missiles targeted Tall al-Hara in Daraa province, south of Damascus, and two areas in the neighbouring province of Quneitrathe, it added.
""The regime s anti-aircraft defence has been activated to counter the attack,"" director of the Observatory Rami Abdel Rahmane said.
The Observatory reported ""loss of life"" without giving further details.
Syrian state television also referred to reports of ""Israeli aggression"" in the region.
Israel has carried out hundreds of air strikes in Syria since the beginning of the conflict in 2011, targeting forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and the regime s allies Iran and Hezbollah.
The Syrian conflict has killed more than 370,000 people and drawn in world powers since it started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.

China says it will 'not tolerate foreign forces' in Hong Kong,"
BEIJING (AFP) - China on Tuesday slammed the US and Britain for interfering in Hong Kong affairs after the two countries voiced concerns about a vicious assault on pro-democracy protesters.
The savage beating of the Hong Kong protesters by a mob of suspected gangsters on Sunday has deepened fears about the use of shadowy hired muscle to defend China s interests.
At least 45 people were hospitalised after Sunday s attack, causing fear and outrage in the Asian financial hub.
The incident has also drawn criticism from both the UK and the US, who have expressed concerns over eroding freedoms in the city.
But Beijing has reacted angrily to other governments and foreign officials expressing solidarity with Hong Kong s pro-democracy movement.
""China will not tolerate any foreign forces intervening in Hong Kong affairs, nor will it allow any foreign forces to disrupt Hong Kong,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular briefing.
""We advise the United States to take back their black hands in Hong Kong as early as possible.""
Hong Kong has been plunged into its worst crisis in recent history by weeks of marches -- which drew millions of demonstrators to the streets -- and sporadic violent confrontations between police and pockets of hardcore protesters.
The demonstrations were triggered by a controversial extradition law but have evolved into a call for wider democratic reforms.
China had promised to respect the territory s freedoms in the semi-autonomous territory after its handover from Britain in 1997.
""Everyone can see very clearly that the current developments are by no means issues linked to freedom of speech and assembly,"" Hua said Tuesday.
""It is a problem of extreme illegal violence. It not only directly impacts the legal foundation of Hong Kong... but also seriously challenges the bottom line of the  One country, Two systems  policy.""
Hong Kong enjoys liberties unseen on the mainland including freedom of speech, unfettered access to the internet and an independent judiciary.
The UK has said it ""will be keeping a close eye"" on Hong Kong s investigations into the bloody assault on protesters.
""During the British colonial period did Hong Kong residents have the freedom to march on the streets?"" asked Hua.
""Since the reunification of Hong Kong with China... Hong Kong residents enjoy unprecedented freedom and rights.""

"Significant withholding tax imposed on motorcycles, rickshaws in Sindh","
KARACHI (Dunya News) – The federal government has decided to impose withholding tax on motorcycles and rickshaws.
According to a letter sent by the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) to the Sindh Excise and Taxation Department on July 22, the authorities have been strictly asked to collect the withholding tax.
According to details, the registration fee of motorcycles and rickshaws will be increased significantly as the withholding tax goes into effect.
The current registration fee of a motorcycle is Rs3,400, but it will be increased to Rs20,900, whereas for rickshaws, the current registration fee of Rs3,100 will be raised to Rs10,750 after the imposition of the tax.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German blue-chip companies BASF, Siemens, Henkel along with a host of others said on Wednesday they had been victims of cyber attacks, confirming a German media report which said the likely culprit was a state-backed Chinese group.
Public broadcaster ARD said the hackers used a type of malware called Winnti, which allows attackers to remotely access a victim’s computer network. ARD said an analysis of the malware code showed which companies were targeted by a group likely working for the Chinese government.
Alongside the German firms named, companies including drug maker Roche, hotels group Marriott, airline Lion Air, conglomerate Sumitomo, and chemicals group Shin-Etsu were also targeted by the hackers, ARD reported.
Industrial conglomerate Siemens, shampoo maker Henkel and Swiss pharma group Roche confirmed that they were affected by “Winnti”, while BASF and Covestro also confirmed that they have been attacked.
All said that no sensitive information was lost, while none of the companies commented on whether the attacks had been launched by Chinese hackers.
Shin-Etsu, Sumitomo, Lion Air, Marriott and Valve declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment.
Earlier this year drugmaker Bayer said it contained a cyber attack it believed was hatched in China, highlighting the risk of data theft and disruption faced by big business.

FBR increases values of immovable properties in 20 cities,"
KARACHI (Dunya News) – The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has revised the values for taxation of immovable properties in 20 cities of Pakistan including the federal and provincial capitals and Gwadar to bring them in line with actual market rates.
The FBR issued a separate notification for each city and maintained that the value of immoveable properties on the basis of different categories has been revised with effect from July 24.
This is for a second time in five months that the tax authorities have revised the valuation rates for residential, commercial, industrial and flats categories.
The major 20 cities include Abbottabad, Bahawalpur, Faisalabad, Gujrat, Hyderabad, Islamabad, Jhang, Jhelum, Karachi, Lahore, Mardan, Multan, Peshawar, Quetta, Rawalpindi, Sahiwal, Sargodha, Gujranwala, Sukkur, and Gwadar.
According to the notification, the rate of properties built less than five years ago has been fixed at Rs1,500 per sq. ft whereas the value of building constructed five years ago has been set at Rs1,000 per sq. ft.
The value of sectors I-9, I-10 of the industrial zone of Islamabad has been increased up to Rs5 million per kanal.
The rate of farm houses in Industrial Triangle Kahuta and Tarlai Islamabad has been set at Rs4 million per kanal.
In the sale and purchase of residential and commercial plots, capital gains tax has been incremented by 40 to 45 percent.
Moreover, five percent tax has been imposed on the profit of Rs5 million while selling properties, 10 percent on the profit of Rs10 million, 15 percent on the profit of Rs15 million and 20 percent on the profit gained on the amount more than Rs15 million.
Importantly, the FBR has removed prohibition on the non-filers from buying property with a value of more than Rs5 million; however, besides paying 1 percent withholding tax, the buyer has to pay 5 percent of the rate of the property as fine. In case, if a property is sold after five years, no tax shall be imposed on it.

Soaring prices in Pakistan,"
KARACHI (AFP) - Nearly one year after the election that brought Imran Khan to power in Pakistan, the cricket-hero-turned-prime-minister faces growing anger as he chases an elusive target: how to right the South Asian nation’s teetering economy.
Pakistan has been staring down the barrel of a balance of payments crisis since before last year’s July 25 vote, and analysts have long warned that the new government must act quickly.
In one of his earliest speeches, Khan -- who led the cricket-mad country to World Cup victory in 1992, and campaigned on vows to build an Islamic welfare state -- tried to reassure voters, telling them repeatedly: ""Do not panic.""
But since then the rupee has lost nearly 30 percent of its value and inflation is running at nearly nine percent, and likely to continue rising.
""The price of tomatoes is touching the skies,"" 30-year-old Shama Parveen, who walked several kilometres through Karachi’s sweltering heat to find cheaper produce, told AFP. ""Life has become hard.""
""I need to earn at least 1,000 rupees ($6.30) daily to meet my expenses,"" said 60-year-old Mohammad Ashraf, who sells henna dye.
""Nowadays I can hardly save 500 or 600 rupees... I sometimes think if I fall ill, how could I afford the medicines and treatment? I would die, I think.""
Analysts warn that with Pakistan’s galloping population increase far outstripping growth -- set to slow to 2.4 percent this year -- the country will find no short-term relief, even after the International Monetary Fund approved its latest $6 billion loan.
Pakistan has a rocky relationship with the IMF, which has bailed it out many times before, and Khan secured billions in loans and investment from ""friendly countries"" including China and Saudi Arabia before going to the Fund.
But it was not enough.
Pakistanis are facing the grimmest part of a seemingly endless economic cycle: austerity imposed on millions of poor people, and futile demands for deep-rooted structural reform.
Traders held a one-day strike earlier this month, and on Friday about 8,000 people marched through the city of Rawalpindi to protest against rising prices.
""This government has completely failed ... they are making the country poorer with each passing day,"" Ayaz Ahmed, a 32-year-old university graduate, told AFP at the protest.
Mass demonstrations organised by opposition parties are planned for Thursday to mark Khan’s one-year anniversary in office.

Worse than nuclear sanctions?

But while discontent is rising on social media, where viral TikTok videos mock Khan’s promises, street protests remain a luxury for many.
""I cannot afford to lose even one day of earnings,"" said Karachi spice vendor Naseem Akhtar.
Asghar Ali, an associate economics professor at the University of Karachi, estimates that up to eight million people could slip beneath the poverty line in the coming days.
He singled out Khan’s anti-corruption drive -- which has seen opposition leaders jailed and businesses ""harassed"" -- as causing ""havoc"".
For Shahid Hasan Siddiqui, chairman of the Research Institute of Islamic Banking, the situation is ""worse than 1998, when the country survived international sanctions after nuclear tests"".
Taxes are the issue, he argued.
Just one percent of Pakistan’s adult population is estimated to pay taxes. Khan’s government is pushing hard to broaden the tax base but it remains to be seen whether the latest schemes rolled out by officials will make a difference.
But a tax amnesty by Khan ""allows the rich to get their black money whitened by paying a mere 1.5 percent tax"", Siddiqui said.
""On the contrary, every poor man who buys essentials pay 17 percent in (sales) tax.""
Rarely do the poor ""get to see the inside of a hospital or the schools built with those taxes"", agreed Pakistani author Mohammed Hanif in a scathing New York Times opinion piece excoriating Khan’s Pakistan recently.
Umer Farooq, an investment analyst at AKD Securities, said the policies are ""largely fair"", however.
""The real challenge for the government is how they will implement them,"" he said.
In the meantime, despair is growing.
Mohammad Imran, a 35-year-old vegetable seller in Karachi, said he can no longer pay his debts.
""What should I do? I would commit suicide someday.""

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 were up 22 cents, or 0.4%, a barrel, having risen about 1% in the previous session.
U.S. crude stocks fell more than expected in the week to July 19, declining by 11 million barrels to 449 million, the trade group American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday.
That compared with analysts’ expectations of a decrease of 4 million barrels.
Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub fell by 448,000 barrels, although gasoline stocks rose by 4.4 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 730,000-barrel decline.
The U.S. government’s official figures are due Wednesday morning.
Signs of rising tensions in the Middle East offset a weaker global growth outlook from the International Monetary Fund, which had kept prices largely flat for much of Tuesday’s session.
Iran’s capture of a British oil tanker last week sparked worries about supply disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of the world’s oil flows.
The United States had said a Navy ship “destroyed” a drone there after it threatened the vessel, but Iran said it had no information about losing a drone.
“We are confident we brought down one drone, we may have brought down a second,” General Kenneth McKenzie told CBS News in an interview.
The U.S. warship Boxer may have brought down a second drone last week, a U.S. official told Reuters on the condition of anonymity, although it was still to be confirmed.
The tensions come as the United States aims to cut off Iran’s oil exports and against the backdrop of supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries since the start of the year to prop up prices.

Impact of Axle Load limitation on Pakistan's economy,"
KARACHI (Dunya News) - The government has recently announced to reduce truck load by 50% without realizing the devastating impact it will have on more than 45 local industries. 
Let’s start with the transport industry. Currently, Pakistan has approximately 330,000 Trucks on the road (310,000 trucks and 20,000 oil tankers). And after this axle limitation, Pakistan would need at least 200,000 additional trucks to cater to the transportation of heavyweight products.
Since Pakistan’s domestic trucks production is approximately 9000 to 10,000 units per annum, it will take at least 20 to 25 years to meet Pakistan’s trucks demand domestically.
Or we would need around $12.5 billion to import the required unit of trucks and it will take at least 2 to 3 years, which means a huge slowdown of economic cycle affecting every economic and social sector.
Besides, Pakistan imports approximately 90% of truck tyres with an average cost of $220/tyre so there would be a need of an additional $1 billion per annum to import tyres for two lac trucks.
Similarly, an additional $4 to 5 billion would be required to import oil for additional 200,000 trucks excluding spare-parts’ import bill.
The oil industry will also get affected by this limitation. Approximately 20,000 oil tankers are used to transport oil within the country out of which 10,000 oil tankers are axle load compliant.
After the implementation of this axle load limit, Pakistan would need another 5000 oil tankers to meet the fuel requirement.
This would create the shortage of fuel of around 20 to 25 percent in the country, leading to oil price hike, black marketing, and high industrial and commuting cost.
Moreover, higher freight will result in higher prices of commodities to badly impact the common man’s life. The government will also face a shortfall of 25 percent tax revenue from oil marketing companies.
The said limitation will reduce cement supplies as well. The cement industry’s average annual domestic sales are 42 million tons with an approximate revenue contribution of Rs 158 billion (sales tax and FED revenue).
After this limitation regime, the cement industry will face sales drop from 42 million tons to 20 million tons and that would result in a revenue shortfall of approximately Rs 71 billion per annum in the head of Sales Tax and FED.
The prices of cement will also witness increase as high freight of raw material will result in high input cost for the industry. This situation will slow down the entire construction industry including infrastructure projects like dams, roads, and bridges.
Our policy makers are unaware of the fact that reduction in cement supplies will negatively impact the sales (and revenue to the government) of many industries including steel, tiles, bricks & blocks, electric cables and wires, wood and furniture, lighting and bulb, electrical and consumer electronics, kitchenware and sanitary fitting industries etc.
This regulation would also affect steel industry. The steel industry through its total consumption of 3 to 3.5 million tons per annum generates tax revenue of Rs 32 billion for the government. And after the axle load regulation, the revenue shortfall will be of Rs 12 to 15 billion per annum. So one can imagine how big the loss will be.
The steel industry imports almost 100% of raw material, therefore, the axle load regime will increase the transportation cost by 100% (from port to factories across the country) for the industry. And this will have a minimum of 20% increase in the input cost of the steel industry, which will further hike prices.
The agriculture sector is likely to be the most affected sector of this axle load regime due to 40 to 50 percent reduction in DAP and fertilizer supplies. The agriculture produce will be reduced by 30 to 40 percent which will lead to food shortages and high prices in the country and consequently a civil unrest. This will also create shortage of wheat and sugar as their supplies will be affected due to shortage of trucks, leading to a complete disaster.
The shortage of trucks will give a huge rise to unemployment as millions of skilled and unskilled jobs will be lost in the 45 plus industries. Hence, a huge cut in consumer spending will directly affect the collection of indirect taxes on all the consumer s products. In short, one axle load can lead Pakistan into a complete chaos and civil unrest and more than a trillion rupees revenue shortfall for the government.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-23-19/news_big_images/501753_78710972.jpg,business,"This would create the shortage of fuel of around 20 to 25 percent in the country, leading to oil price hike, black marketing, and high industrial and commuting cost.",neutral

China says needs 'arduous efforts' to meet 2019 industrial output goal,"
BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s industry ministry said on Tuesday that “arduous efforts” will be needed to achieve this year’s industrial output growth target, as trade protectionism weighs on exports and clouds the outlook for the world’s second-largest economy.
Ongoing reforms and restructuring of the country’s industrial sectors pose additional challenges, vice industry and information technology minister Xin Guobin told reporters at a news conference in Beijing.
China’s economic growth slowed to 6.2% in the second quarter, its weakest pace in at least 27 years, as demand at home and abroad faltered in the face of mounting U.S. trade pressure.
Beijing has said it can still meet its 2019 growth target of between 6% and 6.5% and continues to roll out stimulus measures to prop up activity.
China set a 2019 industrial output growth target of 5.5%-6.0%.
Output growth fell to a 17-year low of 5.0% in May from a year earlier, but rebounded to 6.3% in June. Still, analysts are unsure if the gains are sustainable, with the Sino-U.S. trade war still raging and factory surveys showing new orders are continuing to shrink.
Output grew 6% in the first half of the year, Xin said, adding that the country still faces significant challenges in stabilising production given a big drop in growth of industrial product exports.
Trade pressures have intensified since Washington sharply raised tariffs on Chinese goods in May. While the two sides have since agreed to resume trade talks and hold off on further punitive action, they remain at odds over significant issues needed for an agreement.
The prolonged trade war is pushing some Chinese and foreign manufacturers to move capacity to neighbouring countries and rebuild supply chains outside of China.
Companies relocating production is normal and in line with market rules, Xin said, adding that the impact of such moves on China’s economic growth, its labour market and industrial upgrading is controllable overall.
In southern Guangdong, 588 foreign manufacturers adjusted their capacity and moved to Vietnam, Thailand or Malaysia last year, but they only accounted for 1.44% of all foreign manufacturers in the province, Xin added.
China will help ease pressure on firms forced to relocate production, push forward breakthroughs in key technologies and strengthen Chinese firms’ ability to resist shocks, another industry ministry official said at the briefing.

"Oil prices ease as traders weigh Middle East tensions, demand","
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices inched lower on Tuesday as the International Energy Agency (IEA) said it would act quickly if needed to keep the market supplied amid tensions in the Middle East and traders eyed a weaker demand outlook.
Brent crude LCOc1 futures slipped 2 cents to $63.24 a barrel by 0121 GMT. The international benchmark rose more than 1% in the previous session, following Iran’s seizure of a British tanker last week that stoked fears of supply disruptions from the energy-rich Gulf.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures were down 6 cents, or 0.11% at $56.16 per barrel.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) said it was closely monitoring developments in the Strait of Hormuz.
“The IEA is ready to act quickly and decisively in the event of a disruption to ensure that global markets remain adequately supplied,” it said, adding that executive director Fatih Birol has been in talks with IEA members, associate governments and other nations.
“Consumers can be reassured that the oil market is currently well supplied, with oil production exceeding demand in the first half of 2019, pushing up global stocks by 900,000 barrels per day,” the IEA said in a statement.
The potential for disruption in the Middle East has come amid a more fundamental souring of market sentiment in recent days, with hedge funds, producers and traders all taking a more bearish tack in response to what they see as weakness in worldwide demand.
“Lower global demand estimates from OPEC, IEA and EIA have hit crude prices in the last couple of weeks,” said Alfonso Esparza, senior market analyst at OANDA.
“Weather and geopolitical disruptions have been temporary and only the OPEC+ deal has given traders clarity with the group’s commitment to reducing the oil glut at their expense.”
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-affiliated producers including Russia, known collectively as OPEC+, have withheld supplies since the start of the year to prop up prices.
Adding to pressure on prices, Libya’s National Oil Corp lifted a force majeure on loadings at the country’s largest Sharara oilfield, which had been closed since Friday.

Makda appreciates exemption of withholding tax to yarn traders ,"
KARACHI (Dunya News) – Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industry (KCCI) President Junaid Esmail Makda on Monday appreciated the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) for holding numerous meeting with KCCI and taking into consideration KCCI’s suggestion pertaining to exemption of withholding tax to yarn traders into consideration as they were overburdened with additional taxes. 
In a statement issued on Monday, Junaid Makda pointed out that under Section 45A of Part IV of the Income Tax Ordinance about Exemption from Specific Provisions, the sales, supplies and services made by traders of yarn to taxpayers from textile & articles, carpets, leather & Articles including artificial leather footwear, surgical goods and sportswear sector will not be subjected to deduction of withholding tax.
He said that such traders of yarn shall pay 0.1 percent minimum tax on their annual turnover on monthly basis on the 30th day of each month and monthly withholding tax statement shall be e-filed under the provision of section 165 of the Income Tax Ordinance, which was widely being demanded by relevant stakeholders.
He hoped that misinterpretation and incorrect application of Section 113 of Income Tax Ordinance which was against the spirit of SRO.333 (I) 2011 will not be repeated again and FBR would continue to take more such steps which were badly needed as the loyal taxpayers from different sectors of the economy were facing immense hardships and were finding it hard to continue their businesses because of exorbitantly high cost of doing business which must be brought down to provide a level playing field and make Pakistani goods competitive.

KARACHI (Dunya News) – Association of Builders and Developers of Pakistan (ABAD) Chairman Muhammad Hassan Bakshi on Monday urged the government to take stern action against cartelization of cement and steel manufacturers, who are denting the economy of Pakistan by destroying construction industry, which is providing jobs to more than 2.5 million skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workforce of the country. 
The Chairman, in a statement, said that steel bars were being sold at the rate of Rs95,000 per ton and cement was being sold at the rate of Rs550 per 50 kilograms bag just two months ago but now steel and cement are being sold at the rates of Rs120000 per ton and Rs700 per 50 kilograms per bag respectively. In this situation, the dream of Prime Minister Imran Khan for building 5 million affordable houses will never come true as the cost of construction has reached to all time high in Pakistan.
He said that ABAD has, time and again, requested government to take stern action against cement and steel cartels as they are inflicting huge losses to the national economy by destroying construction sector.

"ICT joins hand with PFVA to uplift horticulture, livestock sectors","
ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – All Pakistan Fruit & Vegetable Exporters, Importers & Merchants Association (PFVA) would assist the ICT (International Trade center), a joint technical assistance agency of the World Trade Organization (WTO) for supporting small and medium size enterprises in development of the Horticulture and livestock sectors in Sindh and Balochistan provinces. 
The International Trade Centre (ICT), a subsidy of the WB in collaboration with the PFVA would make the recently launched project “Growth for Rural Advancement & Sustainable Progress (GRASP) a real success. 
A delegation of the ICT led by Robert Skidmore, Chief of Section & Enterprise Competitive Section was extended warm welcome by the Patron-in-Chief Waheed Ahmed & former Chairman Aslam Pakhali of the PFVA during its recent visit to the Association. 
The delegation of ICT apprised Waheed Ahmed and senior members of the Association about a six year “GRASP” Project under financial assistance would be extended to small farmers of Agribusiness & livestock sector in Sindh and Balochistan for promotion of their small scale businesses. The project is funded by the delegation of the European Union to Pakistan with a budget of Euro 48,000,000. This Project would ensure provision of congenial business environment to small farmers besides providing grants and technical assistance for improving value chain, yield, quality, access to market Information and improvement in standards. 
Waheed Ahmed said that the growers of Sindh and Balochistan are getting badly affected due to Global Warming, scarcity of water and issues of supply chain due to which the rate of poverty is relatively higher in these provinces. The “GRASP” project of the ICT is a need of hour to improve businesses of the small farmers and it is a true replica of the “Pakistan Horticulture Vision-2030” – Waheed added. 
According to the vision 2030, if food security is not improved in Pakistan, National security would be in jeopardy, however if the policies are formulated and implemented in accordance with the vision-2030, the agriculture production would be substantially enhanced leading to increase in GDP volume, multiplication in export and poverty alleviation. 
Waheed disclosed that the vision -2030 which spells out issues of sector and it’s solution on short , medium & long term basis , is a realistic policy framework for the Horticulture which was developed through extensive consultations process with small growers, all stakeholders in supply chain, Research & development -based institutions and Govt. officials of all the provinces . The current deplorable state of supply chain needs a definite improvement to uplift the local market – Waheed emphasized. 
For getting amazing results from the “GRASP” project to be launched by the ICT in Sindh & Balochistan, it was imperative to start pilot project at the district level product-wise so that after analyzing outcome of the pilot project on experimental basis, it can be further be extended – Waheed suggested. For success of the project it’s imperative that the International experts being part of this project must keep in view ground realities, culture, local customs & traditions of Sindh and Balochistan provinces. The farmers may have their limited vision and views about a particular issue and the PFVA having its root in all the provinces of the country is not only well versed with problems of the small farmers but also has through knowledge and adequate experience about supply chain, local & International markets and hence PFVA would extend assistance, support and cooptation to the ICT in this context. Waheed apprised the delegation of the ICT about achievements of the Association in Research & Development, Improvement in yield, reduction in cost of production, steps taken to enhance shelf life and use of modern technology to use water effectively.
The ICT delegation deeply acknowledged vital role of the PFVA for development of the Horticulture sector in Pakistan and expressed it’s sincere desire to work in close collaboration with the Association and said that the delegation was deeply impressed by the Patron-in-Chief due to his vision, familiarity with issues of the farmers, awareness with problems of the Horticulture sector and his deep understanding with demand of local & International market which would be of  great assistance to the ICT to achieve it’s desired goals in Pakistan. The delegation assured, it would continue having meetings with the PFVA in future for success of it’s project in Pakistan.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-22-19/news_big_images/501596_31371752.jpg,business,"The farmers may have their limited vision and views about a particular issue and the PFVA having its root in all the provinces of the country is not only well versed with problems of the small farmers but also has through knowledge and adequate experience about supply chain, local & International markets and hence PFVA would extend assistance, support and cooptation to the ICT in this context.",neutral

Ireland, playing their first Test against England, established a strong position when veteran seamer Tim Murtagh took a stunning five wickets for 13 as the hosts were bowled out before lunch.
The Irish batted for more than four-and-a-half hours, with England bowled out in just over two after home captain Joe Root won the toss.
There was time for just one more over in the day s play when Ireland were dismissed and England sent out nightwatchman Jack Leach, who managed to play out a maiden from Murtagh as Root s men reached stumps on 0-0 in their second innings.

Shoaib Akhtar wants Sarfaraz to be removed ,"
ISLAMABAD (Web Desk) – Former speedster Shoaib Akhtar believes Sarfaraz Ahmed should be kept in the team for his wicket-keeping and batting skills and not as a captain in any of the three formats after Pakistan s dismal performance in the 2019 World Cup.
In a video posted on his YouTube channel, he said that Sarfaraz should be used for his wicket-keeping and batting skills. ""No way should he continue as captain of the team. He should not be the captain in any format.""
Pakistan were knocked out in the group stage of the 2019 World Cup. Sarfaraz Ahmed s men finished fifth in the points table -- at equal points (11) with New Zealand after the round-robin stage. However, the Black Caps qualified as the fourth team for the semi-finals owing to better net run-rate.
According to Akhtar, Haris Sohail should lead Pakistan in ODIs and T20Is whereas Babar Azam should be handed over the captaincy in Test cricket. ""Haris Sohail should be made the captain. He should captain the side in ODIs and T20Is. They should test him (Babar Azam) in Test cricket. I wish him the best. He has scored a lot of runs,"" he said.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-24-19/news_big_images/501886_45472802.jpg,Cricket,"

England collapse to 85 all out in Ireland Test,"
LONDON (AFP) - Tim Murtagh took five wickets as England suffered a dramatic collapse to 85 all out on the first morning of their one-off Test against Ireland at Lord s on Wednesday.
Murtagh, who plays county cricket at the ground for Middlesex, took five wickets for 13 runs in nine overs as Ireland made a sensational start to their first Test match at the  home of cricket .
In the process, the 37-year-old veteran became the first Ireland bowler to take five wickets in a Test innings in what is just his side s third match at this level.
England, on a ground, where they won the 50-over World Cup just over a week ago, were bowled out in a mere 23.4 overs -- and that after captain Joe Root won the toss.
It was the latest worrying batting collapse suffered by England ahead of the Ashes that start next week -- the third time in three years they had lost all 10 wickets in a session in the past three years, having not done so previously since 1938.
It was also their lowest score in a home Test innings since they were dismissed for 77 by Australia at Lord s in 1997 and came hot on the heels of their 77 all out away to the West Indies in Barbados in January.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-24-19/news_big_images/501880_47466596.jpg,Cricket,"In the process, the 37-year-old veteran became the first Ireland bowler to take five wickets in a Test innings in what is just his side s third match at this level.",neutral

Pattinson dares to dream of Ashes return,"
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The six years since James Pattinson last bowled against England have been a soul-crushing treadmill of injuries, rehab and dashed expectations but the patched-up paceman is again daring to dream on the verge of the Ashes.
In a career of cross-roads, the 29-year-old feared he had reached a dead end some 20 months ago, when he suffered a fourth back stress fracture that ruled him out of the 2017/18 series on home soil.
As Steve Smith’s Australia celebrated a 4-0 demolition of Joe Root’s England, 17-test Pattinson was laid up after a surgical procedure that helped extend the career of New Zealand’s injury-prone Shane Bond.
Pattinson knows well not to take anything for granted but after three productive months with English county side Nottinghamshire, the Melbourne man may be on the verge of a remarkable comeback that many would have hoped for but few would have believed.
“I knew that if I was up and running, string a few (games) on the pitch, that I would have every chance of getting picked in an Ashes team,” he told reporters at Australia’s base in Southampton.
“Going back to a year-and-a-half ago when I was contemplating whether to get back surgery and whether it was going to work, there was a month there where there was a bit of unknown and conjecture around whether I would get back to playing cricket.
“Sitting here now after going through all that is quite pleasing that I am here and bowling and putting myself in position to get picked in an Ashes series.”
The world has changed since Pattinson’s last test against England in 2013, when he was forced out midway through the second match of the Ashes at Lord’s.
Australian cricket has been through a volatile period, scaling glorious heights and plumbing unimaginable depths since Michael Clarke’s side were thrashed 3-0 in that series.
Pattinson has mostly been a reluctant witness through it all, adding only five tests to his record, the last against New Zealand in 2016.
His six-wicket haul against Brendon McCullum’s side in Christchurch helped Australia claim a seven-wicket victory and revived memories of his explosive entry into tests when he claimed 14 wickets in his first two matches against New Zealand in 2011.
Then, the 21-year-old firebrand whose brother Darren played a solitary test for England in 2008, appeared set to bowl 100 for Australia.
Eight injury-blighted years on, Pattinson has a few lines creasing his brow and a reserved manner in public but no less determination to realise the promise of an unfulfilled career.
With fellow seamers Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood among the first picked in the test side in recent years, Pattinson may yet be denied the romance of an Ashes comeback.
Just making the squad to be named on Friday would be a small triumph, however.
“You go through your career, you try different things, you get setbacks, you go through strategies and theories and you work out what’s best for you,” he said.
“If my body holds up I think I can challenge them over here.”  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/July/07-24-19/news_big_images/501810_43576977.jpg,Cricket,"“Sitting here now after going through all that is quite pleasing that I am here and bowling and putting myself in position to get picked in an Ashes series.”

Porterfield says Lord's Test a 'pinnacle' for Ireland,"
LONDON (AFP) - Ireland captain William Porterfield will be back on familiar territory when his side s long march to the ""pinnacle"" of cricket ends with a Test at Lord s against England on Wednesday.
The match underlines that Ireland, who have played two Tests, at home to Pakistan in 2018 and against fellow newcomers Afghanistan in India earlier this year, are now among cricket s elite.
Ireland have defeated Pakistan, England and the West Indies at World Cups but a Test at Lord s is something else, according to the opening batsman.
""We have got quite a few World Cups under our belt, little things like that. They have been pretty big occasions, but getting to Test cricket and then having the opportunity to play here at  the home of cricket  is a pretty special thing,"" Porterfield said at Lord s on Tuesday.
""We had a taste of it a couple of years ago with the one-dayer here.... It s going to be a pretty special moment.""
Porterfield once worked at Lord s when he was a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club s Young Cricketers scheme.
""We used to have to dish out the programmes in the boxes and stuff every morning, so little bits and pieces that you have to do,"" said the 34-year-old.
""It s going to be slightly different being on this side of the fence.""
Ireland have lost both their Tests but with England missing injured spearhead James Anderson and resting Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler ahead of the Ashes, Porterfield said an upset win for his side was possible.
""It s 11 guys against 11 guys, it s bat against ball.  You take names, reputation, everything out of it,"" he said.
Ireland, who qualified for the 2007, 2011 and 2015 World Cups, did not make it to this year s tournament, won by hosts England just over a week ago under the captaincy of Dublin-born former Ireland batsman Eoin Morgan.
""It was disappointing that we didn t make the cut,"" said Porterfield
""From a personal point of view, I was delighted for Moggie and everything that he s achieved with England. That s fantastic for him and they deserve all the plaudits that they get.
""But it (the Test) provides an opportunity for us now to get out and show what we can do.""
In batsman Paul Stirling and paceman Tim Murtagh, Ireland have two players who know the conditions well as a result of playing for Lord s-based Middlesex.
Porterfield said he did not feel offended by England s decision to rest players or the fact the match is a four-day Test -- the first played in England since 1947 -- rather than the standard five.
""They (England) have just come off seven or eight weeks of tough World Cup cricket. I don t think they re in any way taking anything lightly.""
As for the match being a maximum of four days, Porterfield added: ""It s a good initiative. You are still making up time with 98 overs (per day).
""I think that the pace at which some Test matches are played at these days anyway, it might be a good thing for the game as well.""
