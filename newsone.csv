Simon Taufel points out grave error in giving extra run to England against NZ in WC final,"Five-time ICC umpire of the year award-winning Australian umpire Simon Taufel has pointed out a grave error for awarding six runs to England instead of five in the final of World Cup 2019. Taufel, who is currently a part of the MCC’s laws sub-committee that makes the rules governing cricket, told an Australian based news channel that England should have been awarded five runs, not six. It’s a clear mistake.. it’s an error of judgment, Taufel said. They (England) should have been awarded five runs, not six. Taufel was considered among the best umpires of his time, he also said that tail-ender Adil Rashid should have been on strike for the penultimate delivery of the innings instead of Stokes. It all happened on the fourth delivery of the over when England needed 9 runs to win. Guptill’s threw from the deep hit straight on the willow of Ben Stokes, which went for a boundary. As per law 19.8, pertaining to Overthrow or wilful act of fielder, If the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be any runs for penalties awarded to either side, and the allowance for the boundary, and the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the throw or act.

Luck smiles on England as Eoin Morgan lifts World Cup trophy for first time,"LONDON: England made history on Sunday by winning the World Cup 2019 after a thrilling super over at the home of cricket, Lord’s. The underdog New Zealand equalized the total (15 runs) but the Eoin Morgan’s team had its name on the trophy due to scoring more boundaries in their batting innings. Needing to surpass New Zealand´s 241-8 to win the World Cup for the first time, England ended on 241 all out after Mark Wood was run out off the final ball. England was looking to Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler (59) to take them home after New Zealand sparked a top-order collapse but after a 110 runs crucial partnership Butler’s wicket gave a much-needed breakthrough to Willamson. Fergusson and Neesham took three wickets each, while Henry, and Grandhomme picked one wicket each. Three-times losing finalists England were in trouble at 86-4, chasing a target of 242, when Stokes and Buttler joined forces. But with 10 overs left, the host nation had recovered to 170-4, needing a further 72 runs for victory against 2015 runners-up New Zealand, also looking for a maiden World Cup win. Left-handed batsman Stokes, born in Christchurch, New Zealand, but brought up in England, was 43 not out and Buttler 42 not out. Earlier, fast bowler, Liam Plunkett dismissed New Zealand captain and star batsman Kane Williamson for just 30 before removing established opener Henry Nicholls for an innings-best 55 in a return of 3-42 from his 10 overs. Chris Woakes followed up with 3-37 as New Zealand finished on 241-8. New Zealand successfully defended a total of 239 in their shock semi-final win over India, when they reduced one of the world´s strongest batting line-up to 24-4. And Trent Boult almost struck with the first ball of England´s chase when he appealed for lbw against Jason Roy but South African umpire Marais Erasmus´s original not out the decision was upheld. Roy, who made a blistering 85 in a comfortable semi-final win over reigning champions Australia, got England going with a straight-driven four off Matt Henry. Roy and Jonny Bairstow, by average the best opening pair in one-day international history, had posted four consecutive century stands coming into the final. Early breakthrough
But New Zealand got the breakthrough they needed when Henry induced Roy, on 17, to edge a full-length delivery that just carried to wicketkeeper Tom Latham. That left England , who thrashed New Zealand by 119 runs in a group match, 28-1 in the sixth over. New batsman Joe Root never looked comfortable while making seven off 30 balls and was caught behind to leave England 59-2. Bairstow had enjoyed a huge reprieve on 18 when Colin de Grandhomme dropped a routine caught-and-bowled chance but fast bowler Lockie Ferguson got him to play on for 36. Jimmy Neesham took a wicket with his first ball, with England captain Eoin Morgan falling for just nine when an uppercut was brilliantly caught low down by Ferguson running in from deep point. But Stokes and Buttler revived England with some well-struck boundaries. Williamson chose to bat after winning the toss in overcast conditions and on a green pitch but opener Martin Guptill, the leading run-scorer at the 2015 World Cup, was lbw to Woakes for 19. That left number three Williamson, who started the match with 548 runs in the tournament at an average of 91.33, having to mount yet another rescue mission. But after putting on 74 for the second wicket with Nicholls, he fell when he edged a rising cross-seamer from Plunkett to wicketkeeper Buttler. New Zealand found themselves 118-3 when Plunkett struck for the second time in 14 balls. Nicholls, who had completed a 71-ball fifty, was out for 55 when he played on after being cramped for room by a Plunkett delivery that curved back into him and veteran Ross Taylor could only manage 15 before falling lbw to Mark Wood. Latham defiantly hit Wood for six but his valuable 47 off 56 balls ended when he chipped a low Woakes full toss to mid-off.

World Cup Final: New Zealand sets a mild target of 242 runs for England,"LONDON: New Zealand, in World Cup 2019 finale on Sunday, set a mild target of 242 runs for host England here at Lord’s, London. Henry Nicholls, with 55 runs, and Tom Latham with 47 runs remained the only Kiwi top scorers of the day. Followed by skipper Kane Williamson with 30 runs. Chris Woakes and Liam Plunkett dismissed three Englishmen each while Jofra Archer and Mark Wood both took one wicket each. When England exited the 2015 edition with an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh, few were tipping them as potential champions in four years’ time. As England captain Eoin Morgan put it, If you had offered us the position to play in a final the day after we were knocked out of the 2015 World Cup, I would have laughed at you. One person not laughing was Andrew Strauss, the former England director of cricket. Drafted into the newly created role, Strauss set about an overhaul that saw the former England captain appoint Australia’s Trevor Bayliss as coach, and place greater emphasis on white-ball cricket. The worth of all that work showed when Morgan’s men, now top of the one-day international rankings, thrashed reigning champions Australia by eight wickets in the semi-final at Edgbaston on Thursday. Many of the elements that made England the pre-tournament favourites were on show in Birmingham. Pacemen Jofra Archer and Chris Woakes reduced Australia to 14-3, leg-spinner Adil Rashid took wickets in the middle and the dynamic duo of Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow — statistically the most successful opening pair in ODI history — launched the run chase with a blistering century partnership. ‘Fearless’ cricket  The challenge for England is to embrace the hype surrounding Sunday’s fixture without letting it inhibit them from playing their brand of fearless cricket. By reaching the final, England have guaranteed an international match will be shown live on free-to-air television in Britain for the first time since the iconic 2005 Ashes series — a chance to inspire a new generation. I think Sunday’s not a day to shy away from, it’s a day to look forward to, said Morgan, an outrider in English cricket in becoming an ODI specialist when the steely Dubliner realised his Test career had stalled. It is perhaps appropriate that England are facing New Zealand in a final between two sides who have yet to win the World Cup. For it was the Black Caps who showed England how to play the modern one-day game at the 2015 edition in Wellington four years ago. They shot out England for just 123 and then overhauled that total in a mere 12.2 overs. It was as close to rock-bottom as I’ve been, said Morgan. Certainly as a captain and as a player, being beaten off the park like that was humiliating. England gained a measure of revenge with a 119-run thrashing of New Zealand in a group-stage match earlier in this World Cup. But that is unlikely to count for much on Sunday. All tournament long, the same comment has been made about New Zealand — they boast a well-balanced attack led by left-arm quick Trent Boult but are over-reliant on captain Kane Williamson and fellow senior batsman Ross Taylor for their runs. The polite Kiwis have responded by continuing to scrap, in the phrase of fast bowler Lockie Ferguson, their way to wins as demonstrated by their dramatic 18-run semi-final victory over India. Boult and Matt Henry reduced one of the world’s most powerful top orders to 5-3, before left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner, aided by superb fielding, backed them up after Williamson and Taylor had made battling fifties on a tricky pitch. While many members of the home side were not even born when England made the last of three losing appearances in a World Cup final in 1992, the Black Caps have the experience of their heavy defeat by co-hosts Australia in the climax of the 2015 edition in Melbourne to call on. I’d be lying if I said we weren’t a bit overawed by the change of scenery, said Taylor as he looked back to New Zealand’s first and only match on Australian soil in that tournament. I think we know what to expect, the pressures that come with it, we’ve been there before. You just have to enjoy it, it’s the ‘Home of Cricket’, I can’t think of a better place to play a final.

"World Cup Final: England, New Zealand clash to claim golden trophy today","LONDON: England face New Zealand in the World Cup final today knowing years of planning come down to a single day at Lord’s.

Jason Roy cleared to play World Cup final despite umpire outburst,"BIRMINGHAM: England star Jason Roy has been cleared to play in Sunday’s World Cup final against New Zealand despite showing dissent at an umpire’s decision while helping the hosts book their place in the showpiece match. The Surrey opener had made 85 to set England well on their way to an eventual eight-wicket against Australia in Thursday’s semi-final at Edgbaston when he was given out caught behind down the legside off fast bowler Pat Cummins by Sri Lankan umpire Kumar Dharmasena. Roy requested a review but England had already squandered their lone review of the innings with an unsuccessful attempt to overturn fellow opener Jonny Bairstow´s lbw dismissal for 34. Nevertheless, Dharmasena confusingly and incorrectly signalled for a review, with Australia pointing out the official’s mistake. Roy, his arms spread wide, clearly believed Dharmasena should have signalled a wide delivery instead and the furious batsman had to be ushered away from the crease by square leg umpire Marais Erasmus. Eventually, a clearly unhappy Roy, whose tirade prompted television broadcasters to apologise for his foul language, made his way back to the pavilion, with England 147 for two in the 20th over. Roy, who admitted the offence, was fined 30 per cent of his match fee for breaching that section of the International Cricket Council’s code of conduct that prohibits showing dissent at an umpire’s decision. The 28-year-old also received two demerit points from match referee Ranjan Madugalle, taking his tally for the tournament to three following a one-point penalty he received for an audible obscenity after dropping a catch in a group-stage match against Pakistan. But match bans only kick in when a player collects four demerit points in total leaving Roy, a key figure in Eoin Morgan’s side, available to feature as England bid to win the World Cup for the first time.

England makes into final of World Cup after 27 years by thrashing Aussies,"BIRMINGHAM: England beat Australia in second Semi- final to make their place into World Cup final after the wait of 27 years. Last time they made into finals playing against Imran Khan led Pakistan team in 1992 where they suffered defeat. Eoin Morgan´s side ended Australia´s bid to retain the World Cup in ruthless fashion at Edgbaston, dismissing their old rivals for 223 and then powering to victory in 32.1 overs thanks to Jason Roy´s blistering 85. England will head to Lord´s bidding to win the 50-over World Cup for the first time, with 2015 runners-up New Zealand, who they thrashed by 119 runs in the group stage, standing between Morgan´s men and the trophy. England, who were in the semi-finals for the first time since 1992, have lost all three of their World Cup finals. The most recent of those painful defeats came in 1992 when Graham Gooch´s side were beaten by Pakistan, while Australia in 1987 and the West Indies in 1979 have also denied England in the final. Australia´s first-ever World Cup semi-final defeat, after seven previous victories at this stage, shattered the five-time champions´ hopes of reaching the final for the sixth time in the past seven editions. While Australia lick their wounds before facing England in the Ashes next month, the progress of Morgan´s team comes after a four-year overhaul. England´s woeful first-round exit at the 2015 World Cup prompted a root-and-branch reform of their approach to one-day internationals for a side that had long placed Test success above all other considerations. Australian coach Trevor Bayliss was drafted in, sparking an impressive transformation that has seen England climb to number one in the ODI rankings and move to within touching distance of World Cup glory.

Chris Woakes and Adil Rashid both dismissed three Englishmen while Jofra Archer and Mark Wood got two and one wicket respectively. Australia, in the second semi-final clash, opted to bat first against England here at Edgbaston, Birmingham on Thursday. Four years of planning will be put on the line for England when they face holders Australia in a blockbuster World Cup semi-final at Edgbaston today. England’s woeful first-round exit at the 2015 edition prompted a complete rethink of their approach to one-day internationals for a side that had long placed Test success above all other considerations. Australian coach Trevor Bayliss was drafted in with the aim of guiding their bid for a first World Cup title. The transformation has been impressive, with England climbing to number one in the ODI rankings under the astute captaincy of Eoin Morgan. Their rise to the summit has been based on dynamic run-scoring, with in-form openers Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow leading the way. But the stakes for hosts England are higher than simply the winning of a match that would see them into a final against New Zealand at Lord´s on Sunday. Host broadcaster Sky has said it will allow the final to be shown on free-to-air television in Britain — but only if England are involved in the showpiece match. It would be the first time since 2005 that a major England men’s home match had emerged from behind a UK television paywall, with cricket having a chance to reconnect with a ‘lost’ audience in its birthplace. But Morgan urged England to avoid being overawed by the scale of the task confronting them in Birmingham. Sometimes I’m guilty of it, you can lose sight of the position you´re in and the fact you´re living your dream, Morgan said on Wednesday. Australia, however, have never lost any of their seven previous World Cup semi-finals — although they did tie with South Africa at Edgbaston 20 years ago before advancing into the final thanks to their superior net run-rate from the preceding ‘Super Six’ stage. England had won 10 of their last 11 ODIs against Australia prior to the World Cup. But that counted for nothing when Australia landed a psychological blow in the group stage, beating Ashes rivals England by 64 runs at Lord´s last month. Australia left-arm quicks Jason Behrendorff and Mitchell Starc shared nine wickets between them in a match where Australia captain Aaron Finch made 100 after surviving a testing opening from England´s fast bowlers. ‘Different team’ Roy, however, was missing with a torn hamstring and since his return, England have secured crucial wins over India and New Zealand that took them into the semi-finals. We’re probably more confident than we were three games ago, we’re a different team, Morgan said. It feels like we´re back to the team we are. Meanwhile, Australia, who have not won in any format at Edgbaston since the 2001 Ashes Test, suffered a surprise 10-run defeat by South Africa at Old Trafford in their final group game. England, as well as finding a way to cope with Starc, will have to contain the run-scoring threat of a powerful Australian top order. David Warner has scored 638 runs this tournament following the left-handed opener’s return to international cricket after a 12-month ban for his role in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa. But they will be without Usman Khawaja after the batsman suffered a tournament-ending hamstring injury against South Africa, while speculation about Glenn Maxwell’s place intensified when the struggling all-rounder did not attend training on Wednesday. It’s a purely optional training session, you’re reading a bit too much into it, said Finch on Wednesday when asked about Maxwell, who has scored just 155 runs in nine innings. Australia are bidding for a sixth World Cup title, having won four of the last five editions. We’re full of confidence going into this game, but England have been front runners in one-day cricket for the last four years, said opener Finch.

Australian coach Trevor Bayliss was drafted in with the aim of guiding their bid for a first World Cup title. The transformation has been impressive, with England climbing to number one in the ODI rankings under the astute captaincy of Eoin Morgan. Their rise to the summit has been based on dynamic run-scoring, with in-form openers Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow leading the way. But the stakes for hosts England are higher than simply the winning of a match that would see them into a final against New Zealand at Lord´s on Sunday. Host broadcaster Sky has said it will allow the final to be shown on free-to-air television in Britain — but only if England are involved in the showpiece match. It would be the first time since 2005 that a major England men’s home match had emerged from behind a UK television paywall, with cricket having a chance to reconnect with a ‘lost’ audience in its birthplace. But Morgan urged England to avoid being overawed by the scale of the task confronting them in Birmingham. Sometimes I’m guilty of it, you can lose sight of the position you´re in and the fact you´re living your dream, Morgan said on Wednesday. Australia, however, have never lost any of their seven previous World Cup semi-finals — although they did tie with South Africa at Edgbaston 20 years ago before advancing into the final thanks to their superior net run-rate from the preceding ‘Super Six’ stage. England had won 10 of their last 11 ODIs against Australia prior to the World Cup. But that counted for nothing when Australia landed a psychological blow in the group stage, beating Ashes rivals England by 64 runs at Lord´s last month. Australia left-arm quicks Jason Behrendorff and Mitchell Starc shared nine wickets between them in a match where Australia captain Aaron Finch made 100 after surviving a testing opening from England´s fast bowlers. ‘Different team’ Roy, however, was missing with a torn hamstring and since his return, England have secured crucial wins over India and New Zealand that took them into the semi-finals. We’re probably more confident than we were three games ago, we’re a different team, Morgan said. It feels like we´re back to the team we are. Meanwhile, Australia, who have not won in any format at Edgbaston since the 2001 Ashes Test, suffered a surprise 10-run defeat by South Africa at Old Trafford in their final group game. England, as well as finding a way to cope with Starc, will have to contain the run-scoring threat of a powerful Australian top order. David Warner has scored 638 runs this tournament following the left-handed opener’s return to international cricket after a 12-month ban for his role in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa. But they will be without Usman Khawaja after the batsman suffered a tournament-ending hamstring injury against South Africa, while speculation about Glenn Maxwell’s place intensified when the struggling all-rounder did not attend training on Wednesday. It’s a purely optional training session, you’re reading a bit too much into it, said Finch on Wednesday when asked about Maxwell, who has scored just 155 runs in nine innings. Australia are bidding for a sixth World Cup title, having won four of the last five editions. We’re full of confidence going into this game, but England have been front runners in one-day cricket for the last four years, said opener Finch. It will come down to whoever holds their nerve and whoever holds their half-chances. AFP.

"World Cup: Semi-final to resume today between India, New Zealand","MANCHESTER: The semi-final clash between New Zealand and India will resume on Wednesday after rain halted the match on Tuesday with Kiwis scoring 211 with 5 wickets down. Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor scored 67 runs while Indian bowlers all got one wicket each. After weeks of close encounters and edge of the seat thrillers, India will take on New Zealand in the first semi-final of the World Cup at Old Trafford in Manchester on Tuesday. Today’s contest will be a repeat of the semi-finals of the 2008 ICC Under-19 World Cup in which a Virat Kohli-led India defeated a Kane Williamson-captained New Zealand in Kuala Lumpur. India, whose group match against 2015 runners-up New Zealand was washed out, have suffered just one defeat at this World Cup so far, against England, and ended on top of the 10-team group stage, making them strong favourites to beat the Black Caps. The Kiwis who were deemed favourites at the start of the tournament kicked off their World Cup campaign on a high, but suffered defeats and only qualified for the semi-finals in fourth place on the basis of net run-rate. They lost their last three games — against Pakistan, holders Australia and England. For New Zealand, skipper Williamson has been in fine form, making match-winning hundreds against South Africa and the West Indies. But the rest of the top order have had a largely forgettable World Cup, with the Black Caps losing 13 wickets in the powerplay at just 23.38 each — the worst record in the competition. Williamson’s 481 tournament runs represent nearly 29 per cent of New Zealand’s total at this World Cup. On the other hand, India’s success at this World Cup has been built on the heavy scoring of a Rohit Sharma-led batting top order. Sharma became the first batsman to score five centuries in a single World Cup when he made 103 in a seven-wicket win over Sri Lanka at Headingley on Saturday, while fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah has been the spearhead of a well-balanced bowling attack.

1992 vs 2019 World Cup: Memes played crucial part in keeping hopes alive for Pakistani fans,"BY: Maryam Qureshi Rollercoaster ride it has been for Pakistan’s cricket team. ‘Unpredictable’ is the term locals use to define this team and no doubt they are unpredictable, from turning an easy target by taking it to 6 on 6. Exactly when everything was taking a turn so did social media posts, from bashing Sarfaraz Ahmed about his unfit body to scolding Shoaib Malik on eating burgers, now all limelight was being shifted to the similarities between the pattern of 1992’s World Cup and 2019’s. Now that Pakistan is officially disqualified from 2019 World Cup I will shed some light on how meme game took turns. Fans started to take notes of the eerie similarities between 1992 and 2019’s World Cup regarding Pakistan’s pattern of losing and wining. Within a day my Facebook feed was flooding with posts saying ‘Ye World Cup humara’   People linking the similarities in every way they could, however failing to realize cricket game is not merely about repeating past events in favor of a team. If this would have been the case, everyday would be the same as Sun rises and Moon sets in a similar pattern and anyone could have said ‘Oh the Moon also rose in the same manner as yesterday, hence this day will exactly be same like yesterday’s .’ But this is not the case, no one can stay dependent on past events. Pakistan started performing well while beating New Zealand, from 6th ranking Pakistan was now on 4th and how could fans resist from making memes. The ‘men in green’ were proud, all hail to Babar Azam’s outstanding performance. Here is a link to one such meme which made me laugh.  During the very match a comparison was also broadcasted between Pakistan’s pattern of winning and losing in 1992 and 2019, well then the picture got clearer that fans were not only noticing but well known commentators were also well aware of this spooky similarity. This too was turned into a hilarious meme.    Have you ever noticed Pakistan’s cricket fans supporting India? NO. But the entire nation was found hooting for India’s win when Pakistan’s access into Semi-Finals was dependent on their victory. I was shopping with my mother while I overheard a few shopkeepers talking ‘Dua kero India jeet jae achay margin se’ Well, this time I wasn’t shocked as we were depending on India for our ticket to semi final. Right when India’s team was not only being supported by their country but by the neighboring country too, Indian players ‘intentionally lost the match’ as said by many Pakistani cricket fans. Batsmen were seen brisk walking on the pitch while making singles and no doubt their actions were clear. Relying on a rival for a gesture which could get Pakistani team into semis was not a good option. India lost and meme generators were active again (Well.. they are never inactive)   This meme showing M.S Dhoni holding a banner saying ‘Apna game khud jeeto’  It might be funny for some and thought to provoke for many. If Pakistani players performed well in past matches then waiting for India’s win would not have been a matter of concern for Pakistani fans. One must understand, Pakistan getting into Finals should not be reliant on India’s performance or the past performances in 1992. In 1992 Imran Khan was the captain whereas in 2019 Sarfaraz Ahmed is the captain. Khan married thrice doesn’t mean that Ahmed would too similarly pattern of winning or losing could have been noticed till generating memes but not for a country’s winning or losing probability. Game is all about losing and winning, I have said this before and I will say it again ‘Tum jeeto ya haaro suno, humein tumse pyar hai’  Long way to go green shirts, I will support you but I would also like to add the fact that if Pakistan’s run rate was maintained at a better number, we might have been a part of Semis Or Finals as players and not as audience.

Mixed feelings for Mickey Arthur as Pakistan out of World Cup,"Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur admitted his side’s failed World Cup campaign left him with mixed feeling as they crashed out despite beating Bangladesh by 94 runs on Friday. To reach the semi-finals, Pakistan needed to rewrite the record books with the biggest margin of victory in a one-day international. But they came up short as their 315-9 meant Bangladesh had to be bowled out for just eight at Lord’s. That impossible task was quickly put to bed as Bangladesh reached eight runs in the second over, allowing New Zealand to join Australia, India and England into the semi-finals. Pakistan secured 11 points in nine games, as many as New Zealand scored, but were ousted on an inferior net run-rate. Arthur, whose contract with Pakistan ends after the tournament, said it was a disappointing conclusion to a campaign that had plenty of highs and lows. It hasn’t ended as we would have liked to have ended it. It’s been a campaign of ifs and buts, Arthur told reporters. If we have a look through our first five games and we have a look through our last five, it’s a campaign of two halves, which has been disappointing. Pakistan had just one win, against hosts England, from five games with three defeats, including a loss to arch rivals India, and a no-result. Inspirational Sarfaraz –
They staged a comeback by winning the next four games but still failed to qualify. Arthur said the task of achieving a huge win against Bangladesh was targeted at the start but became impossible due to the slowness of the pitch. I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a discussion. We won the toss, which was a good start. Getting 400 is a platform. The message we got from Fakhar (Zaman) when he came back in the change room was it was slow and tough to score, Arthur said. Arthur admitted a seven-wicket defeat against the West Indies in the first game hurt his team badly. If we go back, the West Indies game, the first game of the tournament, when you lose like we lost, it’s almost impossible to get back on net run rate, that was disappointing, said Arthur. Arthur labelled his team’s wins over semi-finalists England and New Zealand as the main highlights. It’s nice to sit here and know we’ve beaten two of those top four teams during our campaign, which shows we are not a mile off in terms of where we are as a cricket team, he said. Arthur praised Pakistan skipper Sarfaraz Ahmed for helping the resurgence after being severely criticised for the India defeat. I must say that I’d just like to credit the captain, Sarfaraz. What he was exposed to after the Indian game was atrocious as a Pakistan cricket captain, as any captain of any cricket team, he said. The way he held his composure, the way he led from the front, the way his work ethic never, ever changed. I think he’s been an inspiration to that dressing room, and I think Sarfaraz deserves a lot of credit for this.

World Cup 2019: Pakistan defeats Bangladesh by 94 runs,"LONDON: Pakistan, in their last World Cup 2019 match on Friday, defeated Bangladesh by 94 runs here at Lord’s, London. Shaheen Shah Afridi took 6 wickets and sabotaged Bengal Tigers batting line up. Shadab Khan took two wickets while Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz took one wicket each. Shakib Al Hassan, with 64 runs, remained the only top scorer of Bangladesh who got restricted to 221. Pakistan team hopes to qualify for Semi-Finals vanishes before the match could come to an end as the green shirts managed to score 315 which means Bangladesh has to be bowled out for seven runs, which is seemingly out of the equation. Captain Sarfaraz Ahmed who said in the press conference, a day earlier that Pakistan was looking to score five hundred against the Bengali tigers but his team played with the intent of scoring runs between 300to 320 from the outset. Imam Ul-Haq scored his first century at the World Cup marking an end to his tournament followed by 96 runs scored by Babar Azam. Captain Sarfaraz Ahmed was retired hurt as he came in between the shot hit by Imad Wasim– the ball hitting his elbow. A win for Pakistan can bring them equal to New Zealand but despite the same points, Pakistan will not qualify for Semi-Finals due to the low run rate.

India has lost control over IoK after revoking special status: AJK premier,"ISLAMABAD: Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Raja Farooq Haider on Monday said that by repealing the special status granted to Indian-occupied Kashmir (IoK), New Delhi has lost its control over the territory in its entirety. Earlier, the India government rushed through a presidential decree to terminate Article 370 of the Constitution which grants special status to Indian occupied Kashmir. An indefinite curfew was imposed in IoK and elected leaders were put under house arrest. By revoking Article 370 of the constitution, people from the rest of India will now have the right to acquire property in IoK and settle there permanently. Kashmiris, as well as critics of India’s Hindu nationalist-led government, see the move as an attempt to weaken the demographics of Muslim-majority Kashmir with Hindu settlers. Addressing a press conference here at the federal capital, the AJK PM said that New Delhi had always maintained that it had provided special status to IoK under Article 370 of India’s constitution. They [India] have lost their own stance through this move, he said, adding that a session of the AJK assembly had been summoned to discuss the situation. He declared, India has formally lost Kashmir today. We were never a part of India but today it has lost Ladakh, Jammu, and the valley as well. Kashmiris in IoK are fighting for their lives, the AJK premier said, adding that he feared India would commit a genocide in the region. He said that the government should not only counter India’s propaganda but also present its own viewpoint before the world, cautioning that the revoking of IoK’s special status will not only affect the held territory but also spill over into Azad Kashmir, and that can create a situation between Pakistan and India. Yesterday, I told the foreign minister — and he agreed with me — that the [United Nations] fact-finding mission should be allowed to visit AJK. They should see that we have nothing to hide. This will put pressure on India because questions will be raised over [New Delhi’s] refusal to provide the mission access to [IoK], he said. Haider urged the government to contact world leaders and forums to intervene and help resolve the Kashmir dispute. Talking about recent hostility by Indian forces across the Line of Control (LoC) and Working Boundary, the AJK premier said, we trust the Pakistan Army and we know that it is capable of defending the LoC and Working Boundary. I assure you if India tries any misadventure, every man, woman and child of AJK will stand with its forces. We have some scores to settle with the [Indian forces] as well. For the past 72 years, they have been committing atrocities against Kashmiris in [IoK] and from across the LoC as well, Haider said. He added that he was thankful to the Pakistani political parties for their support to the Kashmiri cause. Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) President Sardar Masood Khan said late Sunday the frequent aggressions by India at the Line of Control (LoC) were designed to bring Pakistani under pressure. Such moves by India were aimed to deter Pakistan from extending moral and political support to the Kashmiri people, the AJK President said while addressing the students and teachers of Karakoram International University Gilgit-Baltistan a day prior. According to the AJK Presidential secretariat, Khan, however, maintained that Pakistan was a nuclear power and its defence rested in strong hands. With input from APP.

Pakistan condemns Indian decision to terminate special status of IoK,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Monday slammed the Indian rush through a presidential decree to terminate Article 370 of the Constitution which grants special status to Indian occupied Kashmir (IoK), as tensions build up in the disputed valley with unprecedented numbers of Indian troops deployed in the region. Indian Home Minister Amit Shah introduced a resolution to scarp Article 370 in Rajya Sabha earlier today, which would revoke the special status granted to occupied Kashmir and make the state a Union Territory with the legislature. The occupied valley would be divided into two Union territories – Jammu and Kashmir, which will have a legislature, and Ladakh, which will be without a legislature, he said, amid uproar from the opposition in the Upper House. A spate of developments in Indian-occupied Kashmir during the past 10 days have triggered fear and panic among residents and leaders, with New Delhi confirming it had deployed at least 10,000 troops in the region. A further 70,000 have been deployed since, according to AFP. Federal Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, reacting to the news, said India violated the United Nations agreement by scraping Article 370, a move widely condemned by the occupied Kashmir residents, as India cannot change the general opinion of the Kashmiri people. FM Qureshi asserted that India is playing a very dirty game by introducing the presidential decree. He said Pakistan wanted to resolve the IoK dispute through dialogue and the country still stands with the occupied Kashmir. Foreign Office, in an official statement issued on Monday, rejected the Indian presidential decree to scrap Article 370 and said the occupied Kashmir is a disputed region on an international level and the Indian move cannot change its disputed status. Pakistan will continue to politically, diplomatically, and morally support the occupied Kashmir and will use every option against the revoking of the region’s special status, added the statement. Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) president and opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif on Monday condemned India’s decision to revoke Article 370 in the strongest words, declaring it unacceptable and an act of treason against the United Nations. Condemning the move, Shehbaz called on the Pakistani leadership to immediately demand an emergency session of the UN Security Council and to consult with China, Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and other friendly countries over the latest development. The opposition leader in his statement reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering support to the Kashmiri brethren and said the people of Kashmir would not be left alone in this adversity. Shehbaz said the move by the Indian government to abolish the article was also in violation of the Supreme Court’s orders. Condemning the decision, Pakistan Peoples Party Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari lamented that the atrocities by Indian forces in occupied Kashmir were continuing unabated. Atrocities in IOK unabated. Extremist Indian govt’s intentions clear. President must immediately summon Joint session of Parliament in wake of Indian aggression in IOK, he tweeted. Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan said Pakistan will continue extending moral, diplomatic and political support to the Kashmiris until they achieve their right to self-determination under the UN Security Council resolutions. In a series of tweets on Monday, she said India must not forget that the nation struggling for its just cause cannot be defeated by any gun, tyranny or conspiracy. She said the international community would have to prove its respect for democracy by supporting Kashmiris. Awan noted that the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) had testified that the Indian army was using cluster ammunition against innocent citizens along the Line of Control, and urged the UN and the international community to take notice of the blatant atrocities. President Dr Arif Alvi summoned a joint session of the Parliament on Tuesday in wake of Article 370 abolishment to review the tense situation in Indian-occupied Kashmir and along the Line of Control after the Modi government confirmed it had deployed at least 10,000 troops in the disputed region last week. Article 370 of the Indian Constitution is a ‘temporary provision’ which grants special autonomous status to occupied Kashmir. All the provisions of the Constitution which are applicable to other states are not applicable to occupied Kashmir. According to this article, except for defence, foreign affairs, finance and communications, the Indian Parliament needs the state government’s accord for applying all other laws. The residents of occupied Kashmir, therefore, live under a separate set of laws as compared to Indian citizens elsewhere in the country, including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights. As a result, Indian citizens from other states cannot purchase land or property in occupied Kashmir.

Indian Army uses cluster ammunition along LoC deliberately targeting Civilian population.

"Civil, military leadership discuss security post Indian cluster munitions attack on civilians across LoC","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday summoned a meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) in the wake of the Indian army’s use of cluster ammunition to target the civilian population in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) across the Line of Control (LoC) in violation of the Geneva Convention and international law. NSC, during the meeting, vowed to respond to any misadventure or aggression by the Indian forces against Pakistan, a press release by the Prime Minister’s Office said. Defence Minister Pervez Khattak, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, and other top civil and military leaders attended the meeting. The participants condemned Indian army’s destabilising efforts in AJK and occupied Kashmir at a time when Pakistan and the international community were focused on resolving the Afghan conflict. They also noted that aggression by the Indian forces will increase the level of violence and turn [the region] into a flash point and a destabilising factor. The more India is exposed internally and internationally in its machinations, the more there are chances that it may resort to desperate and risky options including false flag operations, the statement read.   In a major intensification in the ceasefire violations, India has begun using cluster munitions on civilian population living close to the LoC. The use of cluster bombs on the Neelum Valley over the past few days has caused multiple fatalities and injuries to several others, including minor children. Over the past few years, besides a rise in terms of intensity of ceasefire breaches, India has also resorted to calibre acceleration and air space violations along LoC. The use of a cluster bomb is, therefore, a step further towards the escalation in the situation along LoC. In a series of tweets on Sunday, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan said that the political leadership of Pakistan needed to come on the same page and expose the state terrorism by India in Indian-occupied Kashmir (IoK) and the situation at the LoC. This was not the time for politics, rather it was the time to stand up for the nation’s welfare and for Kashmiris’ right to self-determination, adding that the country’s leadership should send a message of unity and solidarity, she asserted. مقبوضہ کشمیر میں بھارتی ریاستی دہشت گردی اور لائن آف کنٹرول کی صورتحال پر تمام سیاسی قیادت کو یک زبان ہو کر بھارتی دہشت گردی کو پوری دنیا میں بے نقاب کرنا چاہیے۔ — Firdous Ashiq Awan (@Dr_FirdousPTI) August 4, 2019  Meanwhile, the Kashmir Media Service today reported that Indian army spokesperson Colonel Rajesh Kali, based in Srinagar, claimed that seven more individuals had been killed in IoK’s Kupwara district. According to Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), the number of casualties increased to four on Saturday as another civilian fell victim to the shelling, whereas one of those wounded on Tuesday succumbed to injuries at a hospital. The SDMA has put the number of wounded in shelling incidents at 40. Outraged over the firing of cluster munitions on civilian-populated areas of Azad Kashmir, Pakistan on Saturday called for world attention to the ignorance of the widely accepted international ban on the weapons by India and massive human rights abuses being committed by Indian forces inside occupied Kashmir. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) confirmed that on the night of July 30 and 31, the Indian army targeted the civilian population in the Neelum Valley through artillery using cluster ammunition, which led to the martyrdom of two civilians, including a four-year-old boy, and injuries to 11 others. The ISPR, the media wing of the army, also released pictures of scattered munitions as well as those of the victims. The Pakistan Army media wing said that the use of cluster ammunition is prohibited under the Convention on Cluster Ammunition because of its severe impact on non-combatants, adding, this is [a] violation of Geneva Convention and international humanitarian law. The NSC meeting also comes in wake of Indian accusations of a cross-LoC incursion and resultant casualties. The Indian Army had claimed it had successfully foiled a ‘border action team’ (BAT) operation by the Pakistan Army in the Keran sector of Jammu and Kashmir — a claim rejected by both ISPR and the Foreign Office (FO). ISPR, in a tweet, said, Indian allegations of cross LOC action by Pakistan and possession of bodies are mere propaganda. Such blatant lies / staged dramas are Indian disinformation manoeuvre to divert world attention from increased atrocities by Indian occupation forces inside the occupied Kashmir.

The government has also introduced other security measures — including a call to stock up food and fuel — over terror threat claims. But while the Indian military and the state government have highlighted the security risk, Kashmiri and opposition politicians in New Delhi have raised concerns that the extra troops were being deployed for other reasons. They include fears that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government could carry out a threat to scrap Kashmir’s special status under the Indian constitution. On Saturday, the FO had expressed serious concern over the progressively deteriorating situation in IoK.

BJP murdered democracy: Indian opposition responds to Article 370 scrapping,"Indian President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday signed an order revoking the special status granted to Indian-occupied Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution — a move heatedly opposed by the majority of the opposition.

We will do anything to protect the constitution. But today, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has murdered the constitution. It has murdered democracy, he stated. You have played with the sentiments of people of Kashmir. When additional army personnel were deployed there, I was worried. Kashmir should not become Kosovo, East Timor and South Sudan.

"India terminates special status of occupied Kashmir, places region under lockdown","The Indian government on Monday rushed through a presidential decree to terminate Article 370 of the Constitution which grants special status to Indian occupied Kashmir (IoK), as tensions build up in the disputed valley with unprecedented numbers of Indian troops deployed in the region. Indian Home Minister Amit Shah introduced a resolution to scarp Article 370 in Rajya Sabha earlier today, which would revoke the special status granted to occupied Kashmir and make the state a Union Territory with the legislature. The occupied valley would be divided into two Union territories – Jammu and Kashmir, which will have a legislature, and Ladakh, which will be without a legislature, he said, amid uproar from the opposition in the Upper House.  A spate of developments in Indian-occupied Kashmir during the past 10 days have triggered fear and panic among residents and leaders, with New Delhi confirming it had deployed at least 10,000 troops in the region. A further 70,000 have been deployed since, according to AFP. Article 370 of the Indian Constitution is a ‘temporary provision’ which grants special autonomous status to occupied Kashmir. All the provisions of the Constitution which are applicable to other states are not applicable to occupied Kashmir. According to this article, except for defence, foreign affairs, finance and communications, the Indian Parliament needs the state government’s accord for applying all other laws. The residents of occupied Kashmir, therefore, live under a separate set of laws as compared to Indian citizens elsewhere in the country, including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights. As a result, Indian citizens from other states cannot purchase land or property in occupied Kashmir. Former chief minister of Indian-occupied Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti condemned the proposed revocation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution in a series of tweets. She wrote, people like us who placed faith in Parliament, the temple of democracy have been deceived. Those elements in J&K who rejected the [Indian] constitution & sought resolution under the UN have been vindicated. This will exacerbate the alienation Kashmiris feel. The former minister added, what did J&K get for acceding to India? Another partition along communal lines? Our special status isn’t a gift bestowed upon us. It’s a right guaranteed by the same parliament. A contract entered into by J&K leadership & India. Today the very same contract has been violated. Omar Abdullah, Vice-President of National Conference and former chief minister of Jammu & Kashmir, also issued a statement on the matter. Government of India’s unilateral and shocking decisions today are a total betrayal of the trust that the people of Jammu & Kashmir had reposed in India when the State acceded to it in 1947 — the decisions will have far-reaching and dangerous consequences. The scrapping of Articles 370 and 35A raise fundamental questions on the state’s accession because that was done on the very terms enunciated in these Articles. The decisions are unilateral, illegal and unconstitutional and will be challenged as such by the National Conference . A long and tough battle lies ahead. We are ready for that. Indian authorities have meanwhile placed large parts of the disputed region under lockdown. Communications were cut, with private mobile networks, internet services and telephone landlines suspended. Before the network disruptions, senior former and current Kashmiri political leaders tweeted that they had been put under house arrest. Former chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti were among the leaders placed under house arrest late Sunday night as curfew-like restrictions were imposed in the region.  As per the order, there shall be no movement of public and all educational institutions shall also remain closed, the state government ordered for Srinagar and surrounding areas in a statement obtained by AFP. There will be a complete bar on holding any kind of public meetings or rallies during the period of operation of this order. The United Nations has appealed to India and Pakistan to exercise maximum restraint amid escalating tensions between the two countries along the Line of Control (LoC) in the disputed Kashmir region. The statement added, the United Nations appeals to both sides to exercise maximum restraint to ensure that the situation does not further deteriorate. Pakistan will effectively respond to any type of aggression or provocation from India with its people’s support, Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Sunday after a meeting of the National Security Council. A strategy to effectively respond to provocation by India was devised during the NSC meeting, a notification said, as the security situation of the country was assessed.

"US, Taliban aim for peace in second day of talks","The US and the Taliban will seek to thrash out elements of a deal to bring a close to Afghanistan’s 18-year conflict in the second day of renewed talks in Doha on Sunday. The US, which invaded Afghanistan and toppled the Taliban in 2001, wants to withdraw thousands of troops and turn the page on its longest-ever war. But it would first seek assurances from the insurgents that they would renounce Al-Qaeda and stop other militants like the Islamic State group using the country as a haven. The talks, now in their eighth round, began on Saturday and were due to resume Sunday morning after pausing overnight, US and Taliban sources told AFP. A Taliban source also said efforts were underway to organise a direct meeting between US envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban co-founder Mullah Baradar, who heads the movement’s political wing. A coalition led by Washington ousted the Taliban in late 2001 accusing it of harbouring Al-Qaeda jihadists who claimed the September 11 attacks against the US that killed almost 3,000 people. But despite a rapid conclusion to the conventional phase of the war, the Taliban have proved formidable insurgents, bogging down US troops for years. Washington is hoping to strike a peace deal with the Taliban by September 1 — ahead of Afghan polls due the same month, and US presidential elections due in 2020. US President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday that we’ve made a lot of progress. We’re talking. We are pursuing a peace agreement not a withdrawal agreement, a peace agreement that enables withdrawal, Khalilzad tweeted on Friday as he arrived in Doha after talks with Prime Minister Imran Khan in Islamabad. Our presence in Afghanistan is conditions-based, and any withdrawal will be conditions-based. In another sign of progress, the Afghan government has formed a negotiating team for separate peace talks with the Taliban that diplomats hope could be held as early as later this month. ‘Negotiations will be tough’ The Washington Post reported on Thursday that an initial deal to end the war would see the US force in Afghanistan reduced to as low as 8,000 from the current level of around 14,000. In exchange, the Taliban would abide by a ceasefire, renounce Al-Qaeda, and talk to the Kabul administration. An Afghan official hinted last week that the government of President Ashraf Ghani was preparing for direct talks with the Taliban, the details of which have yet to be announced. We have no preconditions to begin talks, but the peace agreement is not without conditions, Ghani wrote in Pashto on his Facebook page on Friday ahead of the talks. We want a republic government not an emirate, he said, a challenge to the Taliban which has insisted on reverting to the Islamic Emirate name Afghanistan bore under its rule. The negotiations will be tough, and the Taliban should know that no Afghan is inferior in religion or courage to them. The thorny issues of power-sharing with the Taliban, the role of regional powers including Pakistan and India, and the fate of Ghani’s administration also remain unresolved. The latest US-Taliban encounter follows last month’s talks between influential Afghans and the Taliban which agreed a roadmap for peace — but stopped short of calling for a ceasefire. Kabul resident Somaya Mustafa, 20, said her country desperately needed a peace deal, but only one in which the Taliban accept women and their achievements. It is a total mess in our country right now. And if it continues, women will suffer more than anyone else. The United Nations has said that civilian casualty rates across Afghanistan matched record levels last month, following a dip earlier in the year. AP.

Gunman kills 20 at Walmart store in Texas,"EL PASO: A man armed with a rifle opened fire at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, on Saturday, killing 20 people and wounding 26 others as panicked shoppers and employees scurried for cover before the gunman surrendered to police at the scene. Many shoppers in the busy store were buying back-to-school supplies when they found themselves caught up in the latest US mass shooting, which came just six days after a teenage gunman killed three people at a summer food festival in Northern California. Saturday’s suspect was officially identified as a 21-year-old white male from Allen, Texas, a Dallas suburb some 650 miles (1,046 km) east of El Paso, which lies along the Rio Grande, across the US-Mexico border from Ciudad Juarez. Citing law enforcement officials, multiple media reports named the suspect as Patrick Crusius. El Paso police chief Greg Allen said authorities were examining a manifesto from the suspect indicating there is a potential nexus to a hate crime. Officials declined to elaborate and said the investigation was continuing. But a four-page statement posted on 8chan, an online message board often used by extremists, and believed to have been authored by the suspect, called the Walmart attack a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas. It also expressed for support for the gunman who killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. CNN reported that the FBI has opened a domestic terror investigation into the shooting. El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, together with the neighbouring city of Las Cruces, New Mexico, form a metropolitan border area of some 2.5 million residents constituting one of the largest bilingual, bi-national populations in the Western Hemisphere. Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said three Mexican nationals were among the dead, and six others were among the wounded. The carnage ranked as the eighth-deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, after a 1984 shooting in San Ysidro, California, that claimed 21 lives. We are going to aggressively prosecute it both as capital murder but also as a hate crime, which is exactly what it appears to be, Texas Governor Greg Abbott told reporters, adding, I don’t want to get ahead of the evidence. Suspect surrendered  Details of how the shooting unfolded were not immediately clear. But video from the scene broadcast by CNN showed victims lying on the ground inside and outside the store. The suspect surrendered to police as officers closed in on him, and he was taken into custody without incident, according to authorities. Video posted on social media appeared to show him being handcuffed by police and placed in a squad car. El Paso Mayor Dee Margo said police responded to the shooting within six minutes. Citing a law enforcement source, El Paso television station KTSM published on its website what it said were two photos of the suspect taken by security cameras as he entered the Walmart. The images showed a young man wearing eyeglasses, khaki trousers and a dark T-shirt, wielding an assault-style rifle. He appeared to be wearing headphones or ear protection. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the images.  On Twitter, US President Donald Trump branded the shooting an act of cowardice, adding, I know that I stand with everyone in this Country to condemn today’s hateful act. There are no reasons or excuses that will ever justify killing innocent people. The University Medical Center of El Paso received 13 patients from the shooting, including one victim who died, hospital spokesman Ryan Mielke told CNN. Some of the patients were in surgery while others were in stable condition, he added. Two of the patients who arrived at the hospital were children with non-life threatening injuries, he said. Local media said there was such an overwhelming response to an appeal by the police department for blood donations to help the wounded that long lines formed at medical centres, some of which had to tell would-be donors to come back on Sunday. Some people handed out bottled water and slices of pizza to those still waiting in line. ‘People were panicking’ Officers from multiple law enforcement agencies raced to the scene at the Walmart and nearby Cielo Vista Mall, including police, state troopers, Homeland Security agents and border patrol. Shoppers fled for their lives, including Kianna Long who was at the Walmart with her husband when they heard gunfire. People were panicking and running, Long said. They were running close to the floor, people were dropping on the floor. She and her husband sprinted through a stock room at the back of the store before huddling with other customers in a steel container in a shipping area. Tales of heroism also emerged. Walmart said in a statement: We’re in shock over the tragic events … We’re praying for the victims, the community & our associates, as well as the first responders. In the aftermath of the shooting, the Walmart and adjacent businesses, including the mall and a movie theatre, were shut down as law enforcement officers scoured the area in an initial search for additional possible suspects. Authorities later said they believed the gunman had acted alone. Video posted on Twitter showed customers at one department store being evacuated with their hands up. The tragedy in El Paso came just six days after a teenage gunman opened fire with an assault-style rifle on a crowd attending the annual Garlic Festival in Gilroy, California, killing three people and injuring a dozen others before he was shot by police and ultimately took his own life. At a Democratic presidential candidate forum in Las Vegas a clearly emotional Beto O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman who is from El Paso, broke the news to the audience about the deadly mass shooting in his home city. O’Rourke said he had spoken to his wife Amy, who was driving in the city with one of their children. Addressing reporters, he teared up and struggled to deliver a short statement. I am incredibly saddened and it’s very hard to think about this, he said. El Paso is the strongest place in the world. This community is going to come together. I’m going back there right now to be with my family, to be with my home town. REUTERS.

"Hamza bin Laden, son of Al-Qaeda founder, is dead: US official","The United States believes that Hamza bin Laden, a son of slain Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and himself a notable figure in the militant group, is dead, a US official said on Wednesday. The US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, provided no further details, including when Hamza died or where. President Donald Trump earlier on Wednesday declined to comment afterNBC Newsfirst reported the US assessment. Asked if he had intelligence that bin Laden’s son had been killed, Trump told reporters: I don’t want to comment on it. Separately, the White House declined to comment on whether any announcement was imminent. Hamza, believed to be about 30 years old, was at his father’s side in Afghanistan before the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and spent time with him in Pakistan after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan pushed much of Al Qaeda’s senior leadership there, according to the Brookings Institution. Osama bin Laden was killed by US special forces who raided his compound in Pakistan in 2011. Hamza was thought to be under house arrest in Iran at the time, and documents recovered from the compound indicated that aides had been trying to reunite him with his father. The New York Timesreported that the United States had a role in the operation that led to Hamza’s death, which it said took place in the past two years.Reuterscould not immediately verify those details. Still, the US government’s conclusion appears to be a recent one. In February, the State Department said it wasofferinga reward of up to $1 million for information leading to the identification or location in any country of Hamza, calling him a key Al Qaeda leader. Introduced by Al Qaeda’s chief Ayman al-Zawahiri in an audio message in 2015, Hamza provided a younger voice for the group whose ageing leaders have struggled to inspire militants around the world galvanised by Islamic State, according to analysts. Hamza called for acts of terrorism in Western capitals and threatened to take revenge against the United States for his father’s killing, the US State Department said in 2017 when it designated him as a global terrorist. He also threatened to target Americans abroad and urged tribal groups in Saudi Arabia to unite with Yemen’s Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to fight against Saudi Arabia, it said. In March, Saudi Arabiaannouncedit had stripped Hamza bin Laden of his citizenship, saying the decision was made by a royal order in November 2018.

US puts sanctions on Iranian FM Javad Zarif,"The United States has imposed sanctions on Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, the latest move by Washington in its maximum pressure campaign against Tehran.

Zarif brushed off the sanctions on Twitter, saying the US move indicated Washington saw him as a threat. It has no effect on me or my family, as I have no property or interest outside of Iran, he said. Fears of a direct US-Iranian conflict have risen since May with several suspected attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf, Iran’s downing of a US surveillance drone, and a plan for US air raids on Iran last month that Trump called off at the last minute.

Afghanistan highway blast kills at least 34 on bus,"KABUL: An explosion on Wednesday hit a bus traveling on a highway between two key cities in western Afghanistan, killing at least 34 passengers, including children, and injuring 17, officials said. Security has been deteriorating across Afghanistan, with the Taliban and Daesh fighters mounting near-daily attacks on Afghan forces, government employees and civilians. The blast on the highway linking the provincial capitals of Herat and Kandahar took place in the Ab Khorma area of Farah province, said provincial police spokesman Mohibullah Mohib. The bomb was freshly planted by the Taliban insurgents to target Afghan and foreign security forces, he said. Taliban officials were not immediately available to comment on the statement and there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Government and aid officials say the numbers of those being killed and maimed is rising because of explosives newly planted by the Taliban, who now control more territory than at any point since their ouster nearly 18 years ago. The attack came one day after the United Nations said civilians are being killed and wounded at a shocking level in Afghanistan’s war, despite a push to end the nearly 18-year-old conflict. Casualties have dropped 27 per cent in the first half of 2019 compared to the same period last year, which was a record, but nonetheless, 1,366 civilians were killed and another 2,446 injured. The UN branded efforts to reduce the violence insufficient. It also said that US and pro-government forces caused more civilian deaths than the Taliban and other insurgent groups for the second quarter running. Child casualties represented almost one-third of the overall total of civilian casualties. Wednesday’s blast comes ahead of presidential elections next month, when US officials and Taliban representatives are also due to resume talks to agree a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign forces in exchange for security guarantees.

52 killed in Brazil prison riot,"RIO DE JANEIRO: At least 52 inmates were killed in a prison riot in northern Brazil on Monday as rival gang factions fought each other, an official said. Sixteen of the dead were decapitated in the second major eruption of violence to rock the country’s severely overpopulated and deadly prison system in as many months. Fighting broke out in the Altamira Regional Recovery Centre at around 7am, an official from the Para state government’s penitentiary department said. Two guards were taken hostage during the hours-long clashes, which were brought under control at around midday. They were eventually freed. Brazilian TV stations showed footage of thick black smoke rising from the prison compound and people sitting on the roof of a building. Other images showed flames inside a building that almost reached the ceiling and people, apparently prisoners, sitting on the ground outside. It is likely that many detainees died from asphyxiation (from smoke), the government official said, adding the death toll could rise. Around 300 prisoners were being held at the jail, the official said, which reportedly has a capacity for 200. An outbreak of violence in the same prison in September 2018 left at least seven inmates dead, local media reported previously. Guards had apparently foiled an attempted prison escape. In May this year, at least 55 prisoners were killed in several jails in the neighbouring state of Amazonas in violence also blamed on an apparent drug trafficking gang dispute. Most of the victims were killed by asphyxiation, the state government said at the time. The federal government dispatched reinforcements to boost security in the jails. Brazil has the world’s third largest prison population after the United States and China, with 726,712 inmates as of June 2016, according to official statistics. The population is roughly double the capacity of the nation’s jails, which in the same year was estimated to be 368,049 inmates. The federal government had been expected to add another 115,000 inmates by the end of 2018, Human Rights Watch said in a recent report. Around 40 percent of the prison population is made up of pretrial detainees. Along with severe overcrowding and gang violence, riots and breakout attempts in Brazil’s prisons are not uncommon. Experts have described conditions in the country’s jails as inhuman, with most inmates poor, black and with little formal education. AFP.

Smith’s second ton enables Australia dominate England,"BIRMINGHAM: Steve Smith hit his second century of his comeback Test on Sunday as Australia set England a daunting 398 to win the Ashes opener at Edgbaston. Ashes-holders Australia, bidding to win their first Test series away to England in 18 years, made 487-7 declared in their second innings as they capitalised on the absence from the home side´s attack of the injured James Anderson. That left England needing 398 for victory, with the most they have made in the fourth innings to win a Test their 332-7 against Australia at Melbourne back in 1928/29. Australia captain Tim Paine´s declaration late on Sunday´s fourth day left England with an awkward seven overs to bat before stumps. Rory Burns, fresh from his maiden Test century in the first innings, and Surrey teammate Jason Roy saw England to 13-0 at the close. Smith made 142 following his 144 in the first innings of the match — the former Australia captain´s first Test since the end of a 12-month ban for his role in last year´s ball-tampering scandal in South Africa. Meanwhile Matthew Wade marked his first Test for nearly two years with a fine 110. ´Spine tingling´ Smith has now scored 1,116 runs in his past 10 Ashes innings, a figure second only to the 1,236 made over the same span by Don Bradman — widely regarded as Test cricket´s greatest batsman. And he is only the fifth Australian to have scored centuries in both innings of an Ashes Test. I´d never scored hundreds in both innings before at any level so I was keen to do that and it´s great to get us in a good position, an elated Smith told Sky Sports. I was very emotional with the first hundred, I was lost for words and had to take a few deep breaths. The spine was tingling a bit. Smith, 98 not out at lunch, went to three figures in style when he cover-drove fast bowler Stuart Broad for his 10th four in 147 balls faced. Smith celebrates He celebrated by removing his batting helmet and waving his bat joyously towards the Australia changing room. And while there was applause from a packed crowd, there were also renewed chants of Crying on the telly, we saw you crying on the telly in a reference to the emotional press conference Smith gave in Sydney after he was sent home from South Africa. He knows exactly what he´s trying to do, exactly what the opposition are trying to do… he analyses every ball and it´s like a computer, he spits out the answer, former Australia captain Steve Waugh, now a mentor to the current squad, told Channel Nine. England captain Joe Root brought himself on to bowl his part-time off-breaks and deployed Joe Denly´s occasional leg-spin as frontline spinner Moeen Ali struggled to exert any control. Wicketkeeper Wade, playing as a specialist batsman, with Paine behind the stumps, reverse-swept Root to complete a 70-ball fifty. The new ball, however, did eventually give England the wicket they craved. Chris Woakes, who strangely bowled just seven overs on Sunday, got one to deviate in the air with Smith edging an intended drive to wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow. As Smith walked back after a 207-ball innings including 14 fours, the cheers at last drowned out the jeers. Wade, who overturned an lbw decision on 69, reverse-swept Root for the 15th four of his innings to complete a 131-ball hundred. He holed out off Ben Stokes soon afterwards but it scarcely made any difference, with James Pattinson belting 47 not out as England became increasingly ragged in the field. AFP.

Starting today: England seek a ‘double’ as Australia eye Ashes history,"England return to ‘Fortress Edgbaston’ for the first Test against Australia on Thursday looking to round off an already memorable season by completing a World Cup and Ashes double. If the World Cup remains the pinnacle of the 50-over game, for England and Australia there’s nothing quite like a renewal of Test cricket’s oldest rivalry. But now there’s arguably more at stake for both sides than the series result. For England, a home season billed as the most important in a generation started brilliantly with their impressive run to a first men’s World Cup title. International cricket in Britain emerged from behind its satellite television paywall for the first time since the celebrated 2005 Ashes so that millions could watch England’s nerve-shredding Super Over win against New Zealand at Lord’s earlier this month. Building on that groundswell of support is a key part of the England and Wales Cricket Board’s post-tournament strategy. Regaining the Ashes represents an ideal chance to keep those new followers on board, even if none of the five Tests are on free-to-air television. For Australia, an Ashes series win under the dignified leadership of Tim Paine would help draw a line under the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa that led to long bans for former captain Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft. All three batsmen are likely to feature at Edgbaston, with Bancroft set to hear the same booing that greeted Smith and Warner during the World Cup. Australia have not won an Ashes in England for 19 years, with their batsmen struggling against the heavily stitched Dukes ball on pitches that offer seam movement. Yet the first Test will be Australia’s opening first-class match of the tour, although the likes of Bancroft, who has been captaining English county side Durham, have recent experience of local conditions. The way an England side featuring several World Cup stars were dismissed for just 85 by Ireland at Lord’s last week before winning the first Test between the countries tells its own story of ongoing top-order woes. England captain Joe Root plans to move back to number three to help shore up a top order featuring novice Surrey openers Rory Burns and Jason Roy. James Anderson, England’s all-time leading Test wicket-taker, is set to return from a calf injury to lead an attack that could feature World Cup hero Jofra Archer. ‘Keep the energy going’
Australia, meanwhile, are poised to put their faith in a rapid four-man attack featuring James Pattinson and Pat Cummins. Several of England’s World Cup winners appeared jaded against Ireland but Anderson, who no longer plays one-day internationals and so was not involved in that success, hopes he can revive any flagging spirits. David Warner and Cameron Bancroft, who shared a match-clinching stand in the first Ashes test in Brisbane in 2017, can expect boos in Birmingham because of their later bans. Photo: AFP
For some of us this is the start of our international summer and it’s our job to keep the energy going as a team, said Anderson, 37 on Tuesday. With runs expected to be at premium while the bowlers hold sway, England will hope all-rounders such as Ben Stokes, restored to the vice-captaincy, can again make valuable contributions with the bat. Australia have not won at Edgbaston in any format since 2001, a run that includes their recent World Cup semi-final loss to England, when Roy made a sparkling 85. England, by contrast, have won their last 11 internationals at the raucous Birmingham ground. But a congested schedule, the result of officials cramming an Ashes into the same season as a lengthy World Cup, could have a bigger bearing on the series, the first in the ICC’s new World Test Championship. I really believe it’s a big ask for the fast bowlers on both sides to play five Tests in six weeks, said Australia great Steve Waugh, the victorious captain in the 2001 Ashes, who is mentoring the current squad. Depth in the squad will be important but I honestly think if I was a betting man I wouldn’t back either side because I don’t know who’s going to win.

Kohli disproves rumours of rift with Sharma,"MUMBAI: India captain Virat Kohli on Monday quashed reports of a rift with senior batsman Rohit Sharma, calling the rumours ‘baffling’ and ‘ridiculous’ before the team’s departure for a tour of the West Indies. Since India’s exit in the semi-finals of the 50-over World Cup this month, reports of a crack in relations between Kohli and his limited-overs deputy Sharma have dominated local media. Even I have heard a lot of things in the last few days. You obviously get to hear these things from outside, Kohli told reporters at a city hotel. If the team environment was not good, then the way we have been playing in the last two-three years, that would not have been possible. I know how much the dressing room atmosphere, the trust is essential in succeeding in international cricket so if that was not there, then whatever success we have achieved, would not have been possible, we would not have been at the position we are in world cricket. Kohli’s men sit atop the world Test rankings while they are second behind World Champions England in the 50-over format. Sharma scored five centuries in the World Cup in England to top the batting charts with 648 runs and Kohli, who is the top-ranked batsman in both Tests and ODIs, said he only had respect for the 32-year-old. In my opinion it is baffling to be honest. It is absolutely ridiculous to read such stuff that comes out there, he added. We are feeding off lies, we are overlooking facts. We are turning a blind eye to all the good things that have happened and creating fantasies and scenarios in our head and we want to accept that it is the truth. And I have seen this for too long now. Bringing personal lives into the picture, it is disrespectful after a moment. India will play three T20s, three ODIs and two Tests against the West Indies with the series also marking the start of the World Test Championship for both teams. It’s a great thing, we all have been looking forward to it. I feel it will give context to all the cricket we would play. It’s a great thing for Test cricket at the moment, Kohli added. Test cricket really needed a boost… It was important to have an incentive attached to Test cricket in a way which the Test championship presents. I’m glad that people have thought about Test to keep it relevant with the Test championship. I think for the pure joy of playing cricket and executing your skills as a cricketer Test cricket is the most important format. For me nothing comes above Test cricket. REUTERS.

"“It was on the cards”, says coach Arthur on Mohammad Amir’s retirement from Test cricket","Pakistan head coach Mickey Arthur has said he is not surprised by fast bowler Mohammad Amir’s decision to retire from Test cricket as it was on the cards for a long while. It was on the cards for a long while. Amir had been speaking to me about it with me for some time now. His Test career was taking a strain on his body. It’s not about management here. It’s about his desire to play Test cricket and the effects it has on his body, Arthur told ESPNcricinfo. He added, I think Amir’s an unbelievable bowler and reluctantly I accepted his decision because that’s what he wanted to do and that’s what he thought was best for himself. What it does do is give us a white-ball bowler that I think we can get a longer period from. He had five years out of the game, we mustn’t forget that. In those five years, he didn’t do anything. His body was not up to the rigours of day in, day out Test cricket. We pushed him as much as we could during England and South Africa series because he is such a good bowler whom we wanted during those tours. We’ve tried everything we possibly could with Amir, Arthur said.  ‘Amir was retiring two years ago, but coach Arthur changed his mind’ He could have managed those five years better. He’d be the first one to acknowledge that. But I understand where he was in his whole life, so it was a tough period for him. I understand all that. I’ve got a very soft spot for Mohammad Amir. As a person and as a cricketer, I admire him greatly. Yes, I am disappointed he won’t be playing Test cricket for us. But it was made in the best interests of his white-ball cricket in mind, he added. Amir, who is regarded as one of the best left-arm pacers after countryman Wasim Akram, announced his retirement from Test cricket last week but said he would continue to play ODIs and T20s for Pakistan. It has been an honour to represent Pakistan in the pinnacle and traditional format of the game. I, however, have decided to move away from the longer version so I can concentrate on white-ball cricket, Amir said in a statement.

Fans chose 1999 Chennai clash with India as Pakistan’s ‘greatest Test match’,"Fans have voted Pakistan’s 12-run win over India at Chennai in 1999 as the team’s greatest game match to date in the country’s 432-Test history, according to a press release issued by the Pakistan Cricket Board on Monday. The Test was played from January 28 to 31 with Pakistan coming back from behind to win back-to-back games on the Indian soil. From July 26 to 29, PCB ran a poll regarding Pakistan’s greatest Test win on its official Facebook page and Twitter handle in which 15,847 fans cast their votes. An vast 65 per cent of votes went to the 1999 Chennai Test, while the 1987 Bangalore Test, the 1954 Oval Test and the 1994 Karachi Test received 15pc, 11pc and 10pc votes, respectively. The poll received nearly 109,000 impressions on Twitter and reached of 1.02 million users on Facebook, according to the PCB press release. The initiative was launched to celebrate the commencement of the World Test Championship, which will take place in England today. The World Test Championship, which kicks-off with the Ashes series, will put the nine top-ranked sides in the world compete in the tournament, with each side playing six series on a home-and-away basis against jointly selected opponents in the two-year cycle. The top two teams will play the final in June 2021. Pakistan’s run in the long-anticipated championship will start in October when they will host Sri Lanka for a two-match Test series. An independent panel of cricket experts and historians which included Benedict Bermange, Mazher Arshad, Dr Nauman Niaz, Osman Samiuddin and Qamar Ahmed selected the four tests for the poll. Wasim Akram, the skipper of that Pakistan squad, while reminiscing the Chennai Test said: If all those who watched it live can still get goosebumps, just imagine the emotions, reactions and feelings of those who were directly involved in that match. We talk a lot about pressure cricket and a match of fluctuating fortunes, well, if anyone wants to know what pressure is and how to handle and deliver in it, then Chennai Test is the benchmark. I was involved in three of the four Tests that were shortlisted and cannot agree more with the fans’ choice of the 1999 Chennai Test as Pakistan’s greatest Test to date. For me, three things from the Chennai Test will always remain fresh: Shahid Afridi’s sublime 141 in the second innings, Saqlain Mushtaq’s five-for in both the innings and Chennai crowd’s standing ovation. Let’s not forget this was our first Test in India since the 1987 Bangalore Test victory and we had arrived in Chennai unsure of the public response. So, our 12-run victory was also Chennai crowd’s victory and the fans’ decision is a testament to that. Shahid Afridi, who scored a total of 152 runs in the match and took three wickets in the first innings, said: Now, that the fans have voted the 1999 Chennai Test as Pakistan’s greatest Test, it is a perfect icing on the cake. I feel honoured to have been part of that mercurial side that had all the grace, class, talent and above all, ability to win from any stage. I am delighted that the fans got an opportunity to remember and cherish the epic feats of our team. I congratulate the stars of the 1999 team. That the victory is still being celebrated after more than two decades underscores its magnificence and what it means to the fans of Pakistan cricket, said PCB Managing Director Wasim Khan. Pakistan will continue to play its role in the development of the game. I expect a record viewership for the final of the ICC World Test Championship in June 2021 which, hopefully, Pakistan will be a part of, he added.

"‘Be match-winners,’ Lasith Malinga advises next generation","Lasith Malinga, Sri Lanka’s strike bowler for so many years, signed out of one-day international cricket with a reminder of just how good he is, taking 3/38 in his side’s 91-run win against Bangladesh. Malinga finished with 338 wickets in 226 matches – going ahead of Anil Kumble to be ninth on the all-time list – wrapping things up nicely with a wicket off his final ball at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Friday, 26 July. Having proved he still has what it takes, he insisted it was the right time to retire as Sri Lanka begin rebuilding for the next World Cup. His will be big shoes to fill, but the pace bowler, who will turn 36 next month, urged the younger generation to step up. My captains expect me to take wickets, Malinga said at the post-match presentation. I tried my best all through my career. I hope all the young bowlers do this as well. Because just surviving in cricket, I don’t think anyone can go far. You have to be a match-winner. That’s what I’m looking forward to in the future. These young bowlers have to get match-winning performances and people have to say, ‘That’s a match-winning bowler!’ We have a couple of guys, they have the ability, we have to look after them. Malinga, who was the top wicket-taker for Sri Lanka at the recent ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2019 as well, chose to bow out in front of the home crowd, and they turned out in good voice to send him off.

"PCB refuses to comment on Imamul Haq controversy, calling it a personal issue","LAHORE: The Pakistani Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday refused to comment on a scandal surrounding cricketer Imam-ul-Haq calling it a personal issue. Pakistan opener has been accused of manipulating and cheating on multiple women. The issue arose on Wednesday when a twitter user posted several screenshots of alleged Whatsapp and Instagram conversations between Imam and several other girls. The user, who wished to be anonymous, wrote, So apparently Mr. @ImamUlHaq12 was dating 7 to 8 (that we know of) women and kept using them and manipulating them. He kept telling them the whole time how he’s single. She claimed that Imam was dating at least three girls at the same time during Pakistan’s tour of South Africa in January and February this year. None of the 3 girls knew about each other, she added. Several other girls on social media have since followed suit and made similar accusations against the cricketer. One of the girls, F*, tweeted pictures and videos with the star batsman claimed she met Imam multiple times in South Africa. Another Twitter user who claimed to know some of the alleged victims said the cricketers demanded indecent pictures from the girls, ensuring them that he was single and would marry them. F* added in the online statement, being a victim to this myself. I can say, yes it is cheating. But in what way is cheating on someone okay, that too, with multiple partners.

Ireland restricts England to 85 runs in Lord’s test,"LONDON: England crashed back to earth after their World Cup triumph as they were skittled for 85 on a humiliating opening morning of their four-day test against Ireland at Lord’s on Wednesday. Joe Root won the toss and elected to bat under blue skies but the morning belonged to Ireland, and in particular Tim Murtagh who ripped through the England order to claim an astonishing five for 13 in nine overs. It is the first time England have been bowled out before lunch at Lord’s on the opening morning and their lowest test innings at home since 1997 against Australia. Murtagh, who plays his cricket for Middlesex, took lethal advantage of a green-tinged wicket and some bog-standard England batting to give Ireland a dream start to what is only their third test and first at Lord’s. When Stuart Broad walked out with the hosts teetering on 43 for seven England had lost six wickets for seven runs with test debutant Mark Adair also helping himself to two wickets. With the Ashes series starting against Australia next week, England handed a test debut to Jason Roy as they continue to seek the solution to their fragile top order. There was a buzz around the ground for the start even if it was a calmer atmosphere than the frenzied one of 10 days ago when England won an unforgettable World Cup final nail-biter against New Zealand at Lord’s. Astonishing collapse White-ball specialist Roy, sensational throughout the World Cup, looked like a fish out of water against Ireland’s impressive opening bowlers and had already had one let-off when Adair had him plumb lbw off a no-ball. His reprieve was short-lived and in Murtagh’s second over Roy (5) edged to Paul Stirling to take a low catch at slip. Joe Denly looked reasonably assured on his way to 23, but in the 10th over Adair shaped a ball back into his pads to claim his first test wicket. Cue an astonishing collapse. In the next over opener Rory Burns, who had scratched around for six, played loosely at a full off-stump delivery by Murtagh and edged to Gary Wilson. With Root and Jonny Bairstow at the wicket an England fightback was expected, but never materialised. Root (2) played across a straight one from Adair and was struck on both pads and not even a review could spare him. Murtagh then bowled Jonny Bairstow for a duck and two balls later removed Chris Woakes, who also departed without scoring, lbw with a ball that nipped back off the seam. The 38-year-old Murtagh then completed his five-wicket haul as Moeen Ali (0) nicked through to Wilson — putting his name on the Lord’s honours board. A brief flurry by Sam Curran drew ironic cheers from the stunned crowd but the carnage continued as Broad (3) edged Boyd Rankin to the safe hands of Wilson. Curran was snaffled for 18 at short leg to leave England teetering on 67-9 and Ireland wrapped it up just before lunch as Adair dismissed debutant Olly Stone (19). REUTERS.

Cricket World Cup final umpire says he do not regret the decision,"The umpire who awarded England six runs from a freak overthrow in the last over of the World Cup final has admitted he made an error and should have given one run fewer, a report said on Sunday. A throw to the stumps deflected off the bat of a diving Ben Stokes as he tried to complete a second run and raced to the boundary, with Sri Lankan umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarding six. Three balls later the scores at 50 overs were tied as England reached 241 all out replying to New Zealand’s 241-8. It took the nail-biting final to a Super Over which again was tied but England lifted the trophy by virtue of having scored more boundaries Critics, including former leading umpire Simon Taufel, said England should have been awarded five runs, not six, as the batsmen had not crossed for the second run at the moment the ball was thrown. Former Sri Lankan Test player Dharmasena told the Sunday Times he did not have the benefit of television replays which showed the batsmen had not crossed. I agree that there was an error of judgement when I see it on TV replays now, Dharmasena, who was umpiring the final with South Africa’s Marais Erasmus, told the local Sunday Times. But we did not have the luxury of TV replays at the ground and I do not regret the decision I made. Dharmasena said he signalled six after consulting the other match officials. So, I did consult the leg umpire (Erasmus) through the communication system which is heard by all other umpires and the match referee, he told the newspaper. While they cannot check TV replays, they all confirmed that the batsmen have completed the second run. This is when I made my decision. Taufel had told Fox Sports Australia the umpires made a clear mistake as the batsmen had not crossed for their second run. But the Australian also defended the match umpires, who he said had to make a complicated judgement, and said it would be unfair to say the decision altered the outcome of the tournament as it was impossible to now what would have happened in the final balls had five been awarded.

IMF to begin search for new leader as Christine Lagarde resigns as of Sept 12,"WASHINGTON: Christine Lagarde will resign from the International Monetary Fund on September 12 as she awaits final word on her nomination to the presidency of the European Central Bank, she announced Tuesday. Her departure allows the IMF board to begin the search for her replacement. With greater clarity now on the process for my nomination as ECB President and the time it will take, I have made this decision in the best interest of the fund, as it will expedite the selection process for my successor, Lagarde said. EU leaders early this month picked Lagarde to succeed ECB chief Mario Draghi, whose single, eight-year term ends in November. Lagarde stepped away from the IMF leadership post she has held since 2011, sparking a wave of speculation about who would replace her. The IMF board tapped her number two, American David Lipton, to serve as interim managing director, but by tradition a European always leads the fund while an American runs its sister institution, the World Bank. With this decision by Managing Director Lagarde, the IMF Executive Board will initiate promptly the process of selecting the next managing director and will communicate in a timely fashion, the IMF board said in a statement. Early candidates mentioned as possible successors to Lagarde include Mark Carney, a Canadian who also holds British and Irish citizenship.

The move follows the agreement with the International Monetary Fund over a $6 billion loan package that comes with tough conditions aimed at cutting Pakistan’s substantial fiscal and current account deficits and bolstering its shrinking currency reserves.

IMF estimates FBR’s revenue to surge to Rs0.5 TN by 2023-24,"ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected that revenues of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) would increase to Rs 0.5 trillion by the year 2023-24. In it’s recently published staff report on Pakistan, the IMF projected that the FBR is likely to collect around Rs5.5 trillion during the current fiscal year which would increase to Rs7.001 trillion in next year while in 2021-2022 the revenues would reach to Rs8.3 trillion and Rs9.48 billion in the subsequent year. The overall revenues of the country will surge to Rs7.165 trillion in 2019-20 followed by Rs8.9 trillion in 2020-21, Rs10.6 trillion in 2021-22, Rs12.12 trillion in 2022-23, and Rs13.37 billion in 2023-24. The report said that the rapid growth of tax revenues in coming years would be ensured by the policy measures committed by the Pakistan authorities. With less than 1.5 million taxpayers filing tax returns and tax compliance generally very low, tax policy and tax administration measures will centre on broadening the tax base while maintaining a low tax rate, aiming to ensure progress of the tax system, it added. Staff and the authorities concurred that an additional 4-5 percentage points of GDP in additional tax revenues could be achieved by the end of the program, bringing Pakistan tax ratio in line with peer Emerging Markets. In the near term, measures include removing exemptions and preferential treatment to reduce distortions in the tax system and broaden the tax base. These include the removal of GST exemptions and preferential rates, except for basic food and medicines, a measure that will significantly improve revenues, the report added. Greater inter-provincial harmonization and coordination of GST will also simplify filing procedures and increase compliance. Over time, the authorities of Pakistan are committed to taking steps to transform the GST into a broad-based VAT and making the PIT fairer and more progressive by raising the upper-end of the PIT structure and consider eliminating PIT tax credits and deductions for the higher income brackets. In addition, other tax policy measures include: (i) further strengthening taxation on real estate and on agricultural turnover or income by provinces; (ii) ensuring equivalent taxation of all sources of income; and (iii) eliminating distortionary withholding taxes. Implementation of a full, risk-based audit framework will be facilitated by the recent reversal of legal provisions limiting the use of tax audits and will be supported by an increase in legal penalties for noncompliance. Moreover, licenses for the track-and-trace system for excises on cigarettes will be issued by end-September 2019 (structural benchmark), with a system rollout by end-March 2020. The government is also considering options to make Pakistan’s tax administration less fragmented and more business-friendly, including through the creation of a new semi-independent national tax authority to collect the main revenue sources, it added. Meanwhile, the IMF has projected that the pressure of current account deficit will also ease out gradually from its peak US$19.9 billion in 2017-18 to as low as $6.95 billion in current fiscal year while $5.49 billion in 2020-21. The trade deficit would also decline to $24.9 billion in the current fiscal year from $29.46 billion in 2018-19, however, it will further go up to $26.8 billion mainly on the back of growing import needs in coming years.

Service charges removed from pre-paid cellular scratch cards,"Mobile phone service providers have started the implementation of a Supreme Court (SC) order to remove service/maintenance charges on pre-paid cellular scratch cards, Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) spokesperson Khurram Mehran said on Monday. On a scratch card of Rs100, a user will now receive a balance of Rs88.9 instead of Rs76.94. In a earlier hearing this year, the apex court had told mobile phone service providers that they could apply a 12.5 per cent withholding tax, said Mehran. However, the court had told them to abolish the 10 pc administrative/service charges. In April this year, the top court restored deduction of withholding tax and sales tax on pre-paid cellular scratch cards by vacating the earlier suspension order by ex-Chief Justice Saqib Nisar. The SC, however, stated that the telecom companies were forbidden to impose any service/maintenance charge. The order dated 11th June, 2018 did not record reasons nor did it determine that the imposition of the taxes was without jurisdiction. We are also not persuaded to hold that the taxes were imposed without requisite legislation or that the six statutes contravened the Constitution, read the order.

The opposition’s bid to block the finance bill after State Minister for Revenue Hammad Azhar was allowed to put it for voting through a motion was rejected by the house with a 175-146 vote. After rejecting all cut motions of the opposition parties a day earlier, the lower house passed the finance bill today. Opposition recorded strong protest over the budget prior to the voting, with most members of the opposition wearing black armbands. Taking the floor, former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said: We totally reject this budget. The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Ahsan Iqbal, taking the floor, said, If the prime minister of a country is taking it towards bankruptcy then the country doesn’t require an enemy. This is an anti-growth budget that will bring in unemployment, poverty, and backwardness. Iqbal deemed the budget an anti-poor, anti-salaried class budget and that the selected budget should be withdrawn and a new people-friendly budget should be presented. Hammad Azhar responded to the opposition by saying that the opposition was quoting wrong figures and that he was sure that the opposition had not actually read the budget document. Azhar, amid strong chanting by the opposition, went on to say, that For the first time in the country’s history, we have reduced civil expenditures up to five per cent. Azhar tried to quote figures from the budget document in an attempt to prove that Prime Minister House’s expenditures had actually been cut and that no new taxes had been imposed on ghee. Azhar said that the government intends to raise the tax by four percent as it has become imperative to ensure stable national growth. The national economy was intentionally paralyzed by previous governments for their vested interests while the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government has cut down the current account deficit by 30 per cent, said Azhar. He added, there exists a need to increase taxes, in the previous 10 years only 2 percent tax increase was seen. The federal government would be bankrupt if the tax isn’t increased by 4 percent. The previous government imposed Rs5,000 tax on every 0.1 million, we have revised it to put it on Rs 2,500.

‘Game of Thrones’ prequel unaffected by S8 backlash: HBO,"BEVERLY HILLS: The first episode of a possible prequel series to HBO’s global hit Game of Thrones has completed filming in Belfast, a network executive said on Wednesday. HBO executives will review the episode before deciding whether to make a full season but Casey Bloys, president of programming at the network owned by AT&T Inc, appeared upbeat about what he had seen so far. It looks really good. The cast was amazing, Bloys said in response to questions at a Television Critics Association event where networks preview upcoming shows. With Game of Thrones concluding its eight-season run in May, many fans are eager to return to the fictional world of Westeros created by author George R.R. Martin. The series was a cornerstone of HBO’s primetime offerings, but its final season was divisive, with both fans and critics finding specific plot twists, particularly the handling of one primary character, troubling. Nearly 1.7 million people signed an online petition calling for a rewrite of the final season. Despite the uproar, Game of Thrones led this year’s Emmy contenders with 32 nominations. Bloys said the backlash did not change the network’s approach to the prequel, which stars Naomi Watts and is set thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones. The petition showed a lot of enthusiasm and passion for the show, Bloys said, but wasn’t something we seriously considered. There are very, very few downsides to having a hugely popular show, Bloys said. One I can think of is when you try to end it, many people have opinions on how it should end … I think it just comes with the territory. REUTERS.

"Mohsin Abbas granted anticipatory bail, police barred from arresting him","LAHORE: Actor, singer, Mohsin Abbas Haider appeared in a sessions court in Lahore on Wednesday where he was granted anticipatory bail on payment of Rs50,000 bonds. The court has also asked Defence C Police Station to submit a detailed report of the case and set the date of August 5 for the next hearing. Police late Tuesday registered a first information report (FIR) against Haider on behalf of Fatema Sohail, his wife who has accused him of cheating and domestic violence. The charges of threats to kill as well as a breach of trust was included in the FIR, but police at the Defence station excluded Mohsin Abbas Haider’s extra-marital affair with another woman. The petition, filed by Sohail, alleges that Haider had an extra-marital affair with a woman, whom he drunkenly brought home with him and whom he took to his bedroom before locking the door behind him. Karachi’s Defence police station has the proof of the claims, added Sohail. Ignoring the allegations put forward by the petition, the police said all angles would be considered in the investigation. Earlier, the statements of both Haider and Sohail were recorded by Raza Safdar Kazmi, the superintendent of police (SP) for the Cantt area. The former had accused the latter of beating, abusing, and assaulting her, and demanding she give him Rs5 million, which she did by borrowing the amount from her father. Sohail further alleged that although Haider’s behaviour changed for a few days after acquiring the Rs5 million, he went out of control again soon afterward and demanded she gives him another Rs5 million. When she refused to do so, he beat her up and verbally abused her. Sohail also alleged that Haider threatened with a pistol when she told her brother, Muhammad Ali, about the matter. Prior to this, Fatema said she did not feel terrified of Mohsin for the first time today. Fatema Sohail, who, too, has worked in the media, spoke to journalists at her residence after meeting Punjab Women Protection Authority (PWPA) Chairperson Kaneez Fatima Chahdar, who had come to discuss the matter of alleged torture. At the police station, I was not terrified of Mohsin for the first time today, Fatema said, adding, Earlier, I used to be petrified all the time about when the abuse would start.

Fatema Sohail urges abused women to step forward and speak up,"Actor Mohsin Abbas Haider’s wife, Fatema Sohail has responded to what Mohsin had to say during his press conference yesterday, in which he denied the domestic abuse allegations levelled against him. Placing her hand on the Holy Quran, Fatema said, my pictures are real; Mohsin had hit me when I was 3 months pregnant. I had never thought I’d get a police case registered, I waited until the birth of my son. He would not only abuse me physically but also mentally by talking to his girlfriend, by swearing at me. I left to go to my mother’s house to save my life and he’s deeming that as a separation. I got slapped on the third or fourth day of our marriage and Dua Malik is a witness to that. I was enduring it all quietly, I was keeping the people from within the industry who knew like Gohar Rasheed and Hamza Ali Abbasi silent because it was a love marriage, I wanted to save my home. He says I fell down the stairs. Why did I not go to a doctor if I fell down the stairs during pregnancy? I was slapped so hard, I couldn’t even open my mouth to speak, she said. Fatema began her press conference saying that Mohsin, who had mentioned in his presser that he had just come from giving his statement at the police station, did not do so. She said she spoke to the SHO who told her that Mohsin had recorded no statement at the station. He is now twisting his words around, saying I was sitting in the car and my lawyers went inside. When he came to the station today, for the first time in my life, I wasn’t scared of this man. Otherwise, I would be sitting in fear, that he’d start beating me, she added. She then shared her medical report from the November 2018 incident on her Instagram stories:  Now that Mohsin sees he’s got no way out, no evidence, he is trying to patch up with me but that is not going to happen. I can not have my baby around such a dangerous man nor do I want to live with him anymore. I’ve received numerous calls and messages from other women saying they are in my shoes but don’t know how to take a stand against their abusive husbands. Women are forced to leave work so they’re scared because of the financial dependence on men, said Fatema, noting that the case has gotten bigger in its scope than her plight. I sort of went into shock because I [spoke up and] was going to fight for my child’s rights but this is so prevalent … this is something else. I’m now fighting for my women as well. Take a stand, come out, and speak up! God is the one who takes care of us all. These women are often financially weak, they think ‘who will take care of me, who will take care of my children?’, she noted. Fatema Sohail further emphasised that these women are afraid of being utterly financially dependent on their husbands and it’s worrisome. Please come out and speak up. Women have said to me they want to soak up but I’m not sure if they would actually be able to or not. They just have the same fear — being financially weak. She urged women suffering from abuse to step forward. Later, Fatema, outside the police station, said she will be determined to her application and will tell the police whatever they asked her. Although she mentioned, the FIR [first information report] is still not being registered. I don’t know what the reason behind this is or if there is any kind of pressure from somewhere but the FIR was not registered. I have told you over and over again that the pictures I shared on social media were from 2018 and in the four years of my marriage, I was abused often, Fatema said when asked about not having a medical test done to file the FIR on basis of the report. I never had the intention to come out in the public about this. I couldn’t open my mouth because he slapped me so hard, she said. At the meeting, the chairperson of Punjab Women Protection Authority, Fatima Chaddar said that Sohail would get all the legal protection that she needed, adding that her case has reached the chief minister and she would receive justice.

Cast explains what happened next to Game of Thrones characters,"Cast members of Game of Thrones appeared at San Diego Comic-Con on Friday to discuss the HBO fantasy epic’s controversial final season. As well as defending the series conclusion, the actors were asked what they think happened next to their characters. Here is what they told a packed theatre at the pop culture fan convention: Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran Stark) –
I can’t imagine his government is a barrel of laughs. It’s probably quite serious. To all intents and purposes, Westeros is now a surveillance state, with Bran aware of everything everyone is doing. Maisie Williams (Arya Stark)
I’m sure she’s having a wonderful time like Dora the Explorer, minus the bob. But maybe she cut a bob in, you know? West of Westeros might like the bob. I don’t think being with a partner is what would make her feel the most at home or the most fulfilled. They (Arya and Gendry) probably see each other at like a friend’s wedding and are like ‘Oh hey, good to see you — how are you doing?' Liam Cunningham (Ser Davos Seaworth)
I thought it was a nice end to the small council in King’s Landing. I’m generally optimistic. I think the spin-off should be ‘Better Call Davos.’ It’s a thousand dollar idea. John Bradley (Samwell Tarly)
Relationships (in the small council) must have soured by now. There’s some drama involved in a group of people who don’t like each other but they’re forced to exist. It basically turns into ‘The Office’. It’s not going to be an easy life for anybody. Jacob Anderson (Grey Worm)
I think he’s starting a new society like Wakanda. He’s keeping his promise to Missandei. He’s sitting on the beach drinking pina coladas and protecting everyone.

Massachusetts prosecutors drop Kevin Spacey sex assault case,"BOSTON: Massachusetts prosecutors on Wednesday dropped a criminal case accusing former House of Cards star Kevin Spacey of sexually assaulting an 18-year-old man at a Nantucket bar in 2016 after the alleged victim refused to testify. Prosecutors said they made the decision to drop the felony indecent assault and battery charge against the Oscar winner after the alleged victim invoked his right under the US Constitution against giving self-incriminating testimony. Spacey’s lawyers had previously accused the man of deleting text messages that would support his defense. The man invoked his Fifth Amendment rights during a hearing earlier this month concerning the whereabouts of his cell phone, which was missing. A lawyer for Spacey, 59, did not respond to requests for comment. Spacey, who has won two Oscars, including the best actor Academy Award in 2000 for his role in American Beauty, had pleaded not guilty to the charge. His lawyers had called the allegations patently false. Mitchell Garabedian, the accuser’s lawyer, said in a statement that his client had shown an enormous amount of courage under difficult circumstances. The case’s filing last year marked one of the relatively rare criminal prosecutions of the #MeToo era, which has seen mostly women reveal widespread patterns of sexual harassment and abuse in entertainment, business and politics. The allegations emerged after another actor accused Spacey of trying to seduce him three decades ago when he was 14, leading Netflix to drop Spacey from House of Cards, and to his scenes being edited out of the film All the Money in the World. Spacey first became embroiled in controversy in October 2017 when actor Anthony Rapp accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986, when Rapp was 14. Spacey apologized for his inappropriate conduct with Rapp. The Nantucket accuser told police Spacey had bought him several rounds of beer and whiskey at the Club Car Restaurant on the island in July 2016 when he was 18 and, according to charging documents, said at one point, Let’s get drunk. As they stood next to a piano, Spacey groped the man, he told investigators. Spacey’s accuser sued on June 26, but dropped the lawsuit a week later ahead of a July 8 hearing in Nantucket District Court regarding his phone, which his lawyer said he could not find after being ordered to turn it over to Spacey’s attorneys. He then invoked his Fifth Amendment rights after taking questions from an attorney for Spacey about whether text messages were deleted from the phone before it was given to investigators. REUTERS.

"Netflix scrubs out suicide scene from popular youth show, ’13 Reasons Why’","Netflix Inc. is removing a controversial graphic scene depicting a youth suicide from its popular young adult drama 13 Reasons Why, following advice from medical experts, the company said on its Twitter account early on Tuesday. The show, based on a book of the same name, depicts the suicide of the protagonist in the last episode of season 1, with a scene of the youth Hannah slitting her wrists in a bathtub. The company said on Twitter that on the advice of medical experts it had decided with the creator Brian Yorkey and the producers of 13 Reasons Why to edit the scene in which Hannah takes her own life. In an emailed statement early on Tuesday, a Netflix spokesperson said, We’ve heard from many young people that 13 Reasons Why encouraged them to start conversations about difficult issues like depression and suicide. While critically acclaimed, the show has drawn criticism from groups including the Parents Television Council (PTC), which claims the show glorifies teen suicide. The move to edit the scene drew praise from a number of agencies including the PTC, which has also lobbied Netflix to drop the show entirely. Netflix has finally acknowledged the harmful impact that explicit content, such as the graphic suicide scene in 13 Reasons Why, is capable of inflicting on children. The American Association of Suicidology and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention were among others welcoming the move. Suicides by young Americans rose by almost a third in the month following the 2017 streaming debut of the popular Netflix television series, a US study found. The National Institutes of Health-supported (NIH) study found a 28.9 percent increase in suicide rates among U.S. youth ages 10-17 in April 2017. It said there was an additional estimated 195 suicide deaths in that age bracket from April to December 2017, versus expectations based on past data. The researchers said the study had limitations and that they could not make a direct causal link between 13 Reasons Why and the rise in suicide rates, or rule out other factors. The show tells the story of a teen who leaves behind a series of 13 tapes describing why she decided to take her life. REUTERS.

R. Kelly arrested in Chicago on federal sex-crime charges,"Grammy Award-winning singer R. Kelly, who already faces state sexual assault charges, has been arrested in Chicago on federal charges after having been indicted there and in Brooklyn, New York, a law enforcement source said on Friday. The source, who requested anonymity because the indictments were still under seal, declined to characterize the nature of the charges. NBC News, citing unidentified law enforcement officials, said they were for alleged sex crimes. Kelly, 52, an R&B singer, was arrested on Thursday by New York police detectives and investigators with the Department of Homeland Security, and is expected to appear before a judge in Chicago later on Friday, the law enforcement source said. He’s expected to be arraigned today in federal court in Chicago and at later date in Brooklyn, the source said. Kelly faces a 13-count federal indictment in Chicago and five counts in Brooklyn, the source said, adding that both indictments remain under seal. Last month, the singer pleaded not guilty to 11 new felony counts of sexual assault and abuse at a Cook County, Illinois, court hearing, after state prosecutors expanded an indictment against him. The R&B singer has vehemently denied abuse allegations for decades. In 2008, he was tried on child pornography charges and found not guilty. The Chicago Sun-Times said Kelly’s attorney Steve Greenberg, on Thursday confirmed the arrest, but declined to give details. Greenberg was not immediately available for comment to Reuters. The Cook County charges involve alleged abuse of a victim between the ages of 13 and 16. The accusations center on someone identified only as J.P. and the crimes are alleged to have taken place between May 2009 and January 2010. Kelly could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted on those charges. In February, Kelly pleaded not guilty to charges that he sexually assaulted three teenage girls and a fourth woman. The charges were brought after seven women, including his ex-wife, appeared on a Lifetime television documentary and accused him of emotional and sexual abuse. The singer, known for such hits as I Believe I Can Fly and Bump N’ Grind, spent a weekend in jail on the sex charges before being released on $100,000 bail on Feb. 25. REUTERS.

Swift, hot off her 2018 Reputation tour and album, earned an estimated $185 million to take the No. 1 spot. The 29-year-old pop star also topped the list in 2016 after her best-selling 1989 tour and album.

About one million women and 400,000 men are stalked each year in the United States. Facebook faces multiple court cases in the U.S. and the prospect of a $3-5 billion FTC fine for its privacy breaches. The Electronic Frontier Foundation dismissedthe impact of that this week, saying that, punitive fines alone, no matter the size, are unlikely to change the overlapping privacy and competition harms at the center of Facebook’s business model. Whether or not it levies fines, the FTC should use its power to make Facebook better in meaningful ways. Says, Zuckerberg’s co-founder Chris Hughes. We might have been watching the hidden yet true series of horror through these shows that unveil what originally had or have been happening. The privacy breaching blunder did come in front of us as clear as crystal. For instance, whatever we post on social media is posted on the internet forever. Hence, it’s a matter of couple minutes to stalk anyone down, with all their information in hand. I don’t know that we’re really much of a binge-watching show, because it’s a bit like being hit by a car,Charlie Brooker told Collider in 2016.How many times can you get hit by a car in one day? How much of these episodes hold the truth? Because if so, it would be a massive chatter for the coming years. Imagine public being stalked through surveillance cameras and judged on your ‘citizen score’ depending on your behavior in the public eye. Yep! China had this policy. Security cameras had been attached on Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, on May 19, 2017, and other public spaces. https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-china-42248056/in-your-face-china-s-all-seeing-state It paints a pretty dismal portrait of our future, leading many to believe the show is anti-technology. Executive producers Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones have saidthat’s not the case though. Rather,Black Mirroris a satire, ribbing ourtech addictionby showing deeply exaggerated stories of a future that may come to pass if we don’t become critical of our relationship with the devices that run our lives. As much as technology has helped the human kind in moving forward in almost every field, it has got hand full of drawbacks and a darker side, much of which the general public isn’t even aware of. Such issues like that with China’s privacy invading techniques or Facebook’s fall are only a few examples of what humans are capable of. It’s still a far thought of what could be made with such technology more in the future and what it holds to surprise. Safe to say, a lot of people have more knowledge of maintaining their privacy better now, however, such shows like ‘Black Mirror’ are a complete package of thrill and horror of the technological world. If you simply couldn’t get enough visions of a technological dystopia, fear not, because a Black Mirror book series is currently in progress.

Rapper Nicki Minaj backs out of Saudi Arabia concert,"LOS ANGELES: US rapper Nicki Minaj said on Tuesday that she was pulling out of a planned concert in Saudi Arabia next week, citing her support for the rights of women and the LGBTQ community. Minaj, known for her raunchy outfits and provocative stage performances, was due to headline the Jeddah World Fest music festival on July 18, but her plan to appear was criticized last week on social media. While I want nothing more than to bring my show to fans in Saudi Arabia, after better educating myself on the issues, I believe it is important for me to make clear my support for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and freedom of expression, the Starships singer said in a statement. The New York-based Human Rights Foundation (HRF) last week urged Minaj to cancel her performance, saying her appearance would be at odds with the rapper’s participation in festivities in New York marking Gay Pride month in June. Homosexuality is banned in Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, HRF Chief Executive Thor Halvorssen welcomed Minaj’s change of heart, praising her inspiring and thoughtful decision to reject the Saudi regime’s transparent attempt at using her for a public relations stunt. Saudi officials last week said the Jeddah World Fest would be the region’s biggest ever live musical event. Other announced performers include former One Direction British singer Liam Payne and American DJ Steve Aoki. Halvorssen said on Tuesday he hoped Payne would follow Minaj and withdraw. When the concert was announced last week, some Saudis expressed excitement about the latest in a string of performances by Western artists, including Mariah Carey, DJ Tiesto and the Black Eyed Peas. However others were irritated by Minaj’s revealing stage outfits. Saudi women are bound to an extremely conservative dress code. Around a dozen Saudi women activists have been detained for the past year on charges related to human rights work and contacts with foreign journalists and diplomats in a case that has drawn global attention after last year’s murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Some Saudis on Tuesday expressed dismay at Minaj’s withdrawal. You say you’ve educated yourself on the issues but clearly that’s not true.

UAE’s du says US ban on Huawei not an issue for 5G network,"DUBAI: United Arab Emirates telecoms company du has discussed US restrictions on Huawei with the Chinese company and believes they will not hamper its 5G network, its chief executive said on Wednesday. American companies were banned in May from selling most US parts and components to Huawei without special licences, raising concerns about the company’s supply chain. Du uses Huawei equipment in its 5G network, but the UAE company’s chief executive, Osman Sultan, said it had discussed the matter with Huawei and it did not see any issue. We do not have a concern for the network deployment, for the use of Huawei equipment within the network, Sultan told reporters on an earnings conference call. Du, which is also using Nokia’s 5G technology, expects to have close to 800 active 5G mobile infrastructure sites by the end of the year. The UAE is one of several Gulf Arab states, who are close partners of the United States, using Huawei 5G technology. Washington says that the Chinese company’s technology could be exploited by Beijing for spying and has threatened to cut off intelligence-sharing with nations that use Huawei equipment. China and Huawei reject the claims. There are regular tests done, not only by us but as well by the authorities … and we never had any instruction or directive to stop the use of any of the Huawei equipment, Sultan said. The other telecoms company in the UAE, state-controlled Etisalat, is using Huawei and Ericsson 5G technology. It has not commented on the US-Huawei issue. US officials have privately raised their concerns with Emirati counterparts, according to two sources familiar with the matter and a former American official, all of whom declined to be further identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. The UAE, which shares intelligence with the United States and hosts US soldiers, believes it can manage the risk, one of the sources said.

Instagram hides ‘likes’ from more users,"SYDNEY: Instagram started hiding likes on its platform in Australia, Brazil and several other major markets Thursday, saying it wanted to ease pressure on users, following criticism about its impacts on mental health. The Facebook-owned social media giant’s trial changes mean users in the six countries will no longer be able to see the number of likes other people’s posts receive. We want Instagram to be a place where people feel comfortable expressing themselves, Facebook Australia and New Zealand policy director Mia Garlick said in a statement. We hope this test will remove the pressure of how many likes a post will receive, so you can focus on sharing the things you love. Australia, Italy, Ireland, Japan, Brazil and New Zealand are involved in the new trial, which follows an initial test that was launched in Canada in May. Although Instagram described the hiding of the likes for users as a test, no deadline was given for when it would end. Instagram, which has more than one billion users worldwide, is a platform that allows users to post images and videos that others can then like or comment on. But, in the chosen test countries, likes will not be visible on people´s profiles, the main image feed or permalink pages. And while Instagram users will still be able to view the total number of likes on their own posts, they will need to click through to another page in order to do so. Social media scrutiny Social media giants have faced increased scrutiny over the impact their platforms can have on users, and there is some research to suggest Instagram can negatively affect the mental health of young people who use it. A 2017 study by the Royal Society for Public Health ranked Instagram as the worst social media platform for young people’s mental health in the United Kingdom. A 2018 survey of teenagers in the United States by the Pew Research Center found that nearly 40 per cent felt pressure to only share digital content that had garnered a lot of likes or comments. Another statement from Instagram as it announced the trial changes for the likes also emphasised they were in response to concerns about the pressures that users felt. We are testing this because we want your followers to focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get, an Instagram spokesman said. We don’t want Instagram to feel like a competition. The latest measure came just a week after Instagram implemented new features aimed at curbing online bullying using artificial intelligence. In another effort introduced in February to safeguard the mental health of young users, Instagram clamped down on images related to self-harm. Instagram said the measures to conceal likes would not affect measurement tools used by businesses that use the platform to promote their products. AFP.

Senate to grill Facebook over plans for Libra cryptocurrency,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK: US lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are set to grill Facebook Inc on its cryptocurrency plans on Tuesday, as the project continues to draw intense scrutiny from financial regulators and politicians across the globe. Facebook is fighting a rearguard action to get Washington onside after it shocked regulators and lawmakers with an announcement on June 18 that it was hoping to launch a new digital coin called Libra in 2020. Since then it has faced a barrage of criticism from policymakers and financial watchdogs at home and abroad who fear widespread adoption of the digital currency by the social media giant’s 2.38 billion users could upend the financial system. Critics have expressed anger that the company would have got so far in its plans for such a potentially groundbreaking project without extensive input from policymakers, especially when it is already in the spotlight over privacy issues. The Senate Banking Committee will question David Marcus, the company’s top executive overseeing the project, on issues ranging from how Libra could affect global monetary policy to how customer data will be handled. Marcus, who was president of PayPal from 2012 to 2014, will try to assuage concerns by promising that Facebook will not begin offering Libra until regulatory issues are addressed, according to prepared testimony the committee posted on Monday. We know we need to take the time to get this right, Marcus, who is also due to testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, will say. Marcus is likely to get a frosty reception from Democratic lawmakers who already believe the company is too large and careless with consumer data. He is also likely to face skepticism from Republicans after President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also voiced concerns. They’re going to have to convince us of very high standards before they have access to the US financial system, Mnuchin said on Monday. UNDER WRAPS Facebook allocated a small fraction of its vast workforce to work on the project, Kevin Weil, who runs product for the Libra initiative, told Reuters on June 18. One former employee told Reuters the company tried to keep the project under wraps even internally – staff who were not involved knew little about it, not even that it was operating under the name Libra. Rumors had surfaced as early as last year that Facebook was working on a digital currency, but news that the project was in its advanced stages started to emerge only in recent months. In the weeks leading up to the announcement, the company began reaching out formally to key regulators including the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But two people with knowledge of the discussions said the conversations remained vague, with key details of the project discussed only on a theoretical level. Some lawmakers specializing in financial services policy have been frustrated by the lack of clarity from Facebook before and since June 18, three congressional sources said. For example, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee sent Facebook a letter on May 9 seeking information, including how the company would protect consumers’ financial information. But Facebook did not write back until July 8, the committee said. After receiving the response, the lead Democrat on the panel, Senator Sherrod Brown, said in a statement he still needed real answers. One Democratic aide described the company’s contacts with lawmakers as inept and entitled. In its defense, Facebook has said that it announced the project in its early stages to get feedback from stakeholders. REUTERS.

India delays lunar mission due to ‘technical’ embarrassment,"BENGALURU: India’s space agency said it delayed the launch of its second lunar mission, Chandrayaan-2, in the early hours of Monday due to a technical snag which was observed less than an hour before the scheduled liftoff. A technical snag was observed in launch vehicle system at T-56 minute, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), said in a tweet. As a measure of abundant precaution, Chandrayaan2 launch has been called off for today. The mission, which the ISRO chairman said is the most complex mission it has ever undertaken, was scheduled to launch at 09:21 p.m. GMT, or 02:51 a.m. local time on the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) Mark III rocket. ISRO said it will announce the revised launch date later. India successfully carried out its first lunar mission, Chandrayaan-1, nearly 11 years ago. The 10-billion rupee ($146 million) mission, if successful, would boost India’s aspirations to catch up with global space leaders the United States and China and put it in a better position to compete in the commercial space market. Success would make India only the fourth country behind the United States, Russia, and China to perform a soft or controlled, landing on the moon and put a rover on it. This would be the third attempted moon landing this year after China’s successful Chang’e-4 lunar probe and Israeli spacecraft Beresheet, which failed and crashed on to the moon in April. REUTERS.

Trump rips tech firms at ‘free speech’ summit,"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump welcomed prominent conservative social media provocateurs to the White House on Thursday and said that along with himself, they are being treated unfairly by big tech firms, which he says suppress conservative voices. Trump said he has told his administration to look for regulations and legislation that could protect free speech – though he did not provide details on what measures were being discussed – and said he would summon major social firms to the White House for talks in coming weeks. We’re not going to be silenced, Trump said, complaining about fluctuations in the number of his Twitter followers. Big tech must not censor the voices. Freedom of speech is enshrined in the First Amendment of the US Constitution. Trump, who regularly lashes out at the mainstream news media for their work which he brands as fake news, made social media a key part of his 2016 run for office as well as his 2020 reelection campaign. But he and other Republicans have long claimed that online platforms employ tactics to silence their voices, allegations that major social media companies have denied. Dozens of pro-Trump online personalities convened in the stately East Room to discuss what they say is censorship on social media platforms, rubbing elbows with several members of Trump’s cabinet and his White House team, and his son Donald Trump, Jr. Amid the sea of suits, several red Trump campaign hats and rubber bracelets popped out. Singer Joy Villa, who describes herself as a conservative activist, wore a flamboyant stars-and-stripes formal gown. Trump called to the stage Lila Rose, an anti-abortion activist who has been blocked from Pinterest; California lawyer Harmeet Dhillon, who has represented conservatives in free-speech lawsuits; and Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, sisters and video bloggers who are better known as Diamond and Silk. Carpe Donktum, a pro-Trump online persona who was recently suspended by Twitter for eight days over a video depicting Trump as a cowboy attacking CNN journalist Jim Acosta, said the face-to-face event could unite online conservatives. In freewheeling remarks that bounced from one topic to another – not unlike his Twitter feed followed by more than 61 million people – Trump talked about the power of social media, and railed against the traditional media standing at the back of the room. We hardly do press releases anymore, Trump said. If I put it out on social media, it’s like an explosion. IT’S GENIUS – BUT IT’S BAD Trump acknowledged criticism about the online behavior of some conservative users of social media. Some of you guys are out there – but even you should have a voice, Trump said. The crap you think of is unbelievable, he said. I mean it’s genius – but it’s bad. Trump more than once has threatened retaliatory action related to free speech. In March he signed an executive order requiring US colleges and universities to maintain free speech on campus if they want to continue receiving federal research funds, and last September he suggested that the license of television network NBC could be challenged over its news reporting. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat, said that instead of focusing on combating Russian social media misinformation, punishing anti-competitive practices, or protecting Americans’ data and privacy, the president has invited trolls, conspiracy theorists, anti-Semites, and the whole comments section to the White House. Trump said he might invite some of the conservative social media users back to the White House for the meeting with major social media firms. Three tech officials said they had no knowledge of the meeting before Trump announced it. Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google declined to comment on Trump’s announcement that he would bring them to the White House for a meeting. The Internet Association, a trade group representing major tech firms like Facebook, Twitter and Google, said, Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect. Republicans in Congress have held numerous hearings on the issue of alleged conservative bias on social media outlets. Republican Senator Josh Hawley, who is working on proposed legislation on the issue, took the stage briefly on Thursday to air his complaints. They’ve gotten rich off of their special privileges from government. They want to keep those, they shouldn’t discriminate. They shouldn’t censor, Hawley said. A Senate panel chaired by Republican Ted Cruz on Tuesday will hold a hearing titled Google and Censorship through Search Engines featuring Google’s vice president of public policy, Karan Bhatia.

Moonwalkers tell what it’s like on the Moon,"Twelve American men walked on the Moon between 1969 and 1972, with most describing in great detail their experiences on the dusty, low-gravity world lit by the blinding light of the Sun. Here are their impressions, collected from a series of oral history interviews by Nasa during the 1990s and 2000s, unless otherwise stated. Right after landing That’s where you experience the most quiet moment a human being can experience in his lifetime. There’s no vibration. There’s no noise. The ground quit talking. Your partner is mesmerised. He can’t say anything. The dust is gone. It’s a realisation, a reality, all of a sudden you have just landed in another world on another body out there (somewhere in the) universe, and what you are seeing is being seen by human beings, human eyes, for the first time. Gene Cernan, Apollo 17 Totally black sky We had a few moments to look around, to look up in the black sky ─ a totally black sky, even though the Sun is shining on the surface, it’s not reflected; there’s no diffusion, no reflection ─ a totally black sky and seeing another planet: planet Earth […] You think to yourself, just imagine that millions of people are living on that planet and don’t realize how fragile it is. Alan Shepard, Apollo 14 The horizon I was surprised by the apparent closeness of the horizon. I was surprised by the trajectory of dust that you kicked up with your boot, and I was surprised that even though logic would have told me that there shouldn’t be any, there was no dust when you kicked. You never had a cloud of dust there. That’s a product of having an atmosphere, and when you don’t have an atmosphere, you don’t have any clouds of dust. I was absolutely dumbfounded when I shut the rocket engine off and the particles that were going out radially from the bottom of the engine fell all the way out over the horizon, and when I shut the engine off, they just raced out over the horizon and instantaneously disappeared, you know, just like it had been shut off for a week. That was remarkable. Neil Armstrong, Apollo 11 There’s a problem on the Moon. Your ─ with depth perception, because you’re looking at objects you’ve never seen before, so a big object far away looks very similar to a smaller object close in. You don’t have any pole ─ telephone poles or houses or trees or cars to sit and judge scale like we did […] down here on Earth. Charlie Duke, Apollo 16 A lazy lope There seems to be no difficulty in moving around ─ as we suspected. It’s even perhaps easier than the simulations of one-sixth g that we performed in the various simulations on the ground. It’s absolutely no trouble to walk around. Armstrong to Mission Control shortly after descending from Apollo 11’s lunar module.  I started jogging around a bit, and it felt like I was moving in slow motion in a lazy lope, often with both of my feet floating in the air. One of the pure joys of being on the Moon was our somewhat lightfooted mobility. Apollo 11’s Buzz Aldrin in his book Magnificent Desolation: The Long Journey Home from the Moon I would say that balance [while walking] was not difficult; however, I did some fairly high jumps and found that there was a tendency to tip over backwards on a high jump. One time I came close to falling and decided that was enough of that. Armstrong during his 1969 technical debrief The gloves The biggest problem is that the gloves are balloons […] to pick something up, you have to squeeze against that pressure, 3.7 psi […] That squeezing against that pressure causes these forearm muscles to fatigue very rapidly. Just imagine squeezing a tennis ball continuously for eight hours or ten hours, and that’s what you’re talking about. Harrison Schmitt, Apollo 17 Hardened soil Getting the flagpole to stand in the lunar surface was more difficult than we anticipated… For the first time a shot of panic seared through me. Since childhood I had seen pictures of great explorers planting their flags in their new worlds. Would I be the first to plant the flag and have it fall over? Aldrin in Magnificent Desolation Nasty dust I noticed some of the moon dust on the floor [of the lunar module]. It had a gritty charcoal-like texture to it, and a pungent metallic smell, something like gunpowder or the smell in the air after a firecracker has gone off. Neil described it as having a ‘wet ashes’ smell. Aldrin in Magnificent Desolation An epiphany All of a sudden I realised that the molecules of my body and the spacecraft and my companion were prototyped in an ancient generation of stars. And somehow it suddenly became very personal instead of an objective: ‘Oh, yes. Molecules and atoms were made in those stars.’ No. My molecules were made in those stars, and this was a ‘wow!'

Facebook not invited to White House social media summit: company,"WASHINGTON: Facebook Inc said on Monday that it had not been invited to a White House summit on social media being held later this week. The White House has repeatedly declined to say who will attend the July 11 event. White House spokesman Judd Deere said last month the meeting would bring together digital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today’s online environment. He said on Monday that Trump will speak at the event. Several conservatives on social media have said they are attending the summit, including Bill Mitchell, a Trump supporter who hosts an online show. At least two social media users posted photos of an invitation to the summit that said it will take place at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) on Thursday. US politicians, led by Trump, have increasingly used social media to try to woo voters directly. Trump has said on many occasions that he would not have been elected without Twitter and Facebook. But Republican Trump has regularly attacked Facebook and Twitter as being biased in favor of Democrats, without offering evidence. He suggested in a Fox Business Network interview last month that Twitter made it very hard for people to join me at Twitter… and they make it very much harder for me to get out the message. In March, Trump tweeted that Facebook, Google and Twitter, not to mention the Corrupt Media, are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats. But fear not, we will win anyway, just like we did before! All three companies have denied political bias. When asked if it had been invited to Thursday’s meeting, a spokesman for Facebook said in an emailed reply that it had not. Twitter declined to say on Monday if it had been invited to the summit or would take part. Alphabet Inc’s Google unit did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it had been invited. In April, Trump met with Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey and spent a significant time questioning him about why he had lost some Twitter followers, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters. With more than 61 million followers, Trump has one of the most-followed accounts on Twitter. REUTERS.

Australia says Samsung lied about phones being water resistant,"SYDNEY: Australia’s consumer watchdog has sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd’s Australian unit for allegedly misleading consumers by promoting water-resistant Galaxy smartphones as suitable to use in swimming pools and the surf. The world’s largest smartphone maker did not know or sufficiently test the effects of pool or saltwater exposure on its phones when ads showed them fully submerged, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) lawsuit says. The case is the first filed by a major regulator and could result in multi-million dollar fines. It centers on more than 300 advertisements in which Samsung showed its Galaxy phones being used at the bottom of swimming pools and in the ocean. The ACCC alleges Samsung’s advertisements falsely and misleadingly represented Galaxy phones would be suitable for use in, or for exposure to, all types of water … when this was not the case, ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement on Thursday. Samsung said it stood by its advertising, complied with Australian law and would defend the case. The South Korean electronics giant has spent heavily on advertising to rebuild public faith in its premium smartphones following the costly recall of its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 devices in 2016. It is due to announce preliminary quarterly earnings on Friday, when it is widely expected to flag a profit plunge due to falls in chip prices. HOT WATER Samsung’s water resistance claims came under heavy scrutiny as early as 2016 when influential U.S. magazine Consumer Reports said the Galaxy S7 phone – which appears dunked in a fish tank in commercials – had failed an immersion test. The company attributed that to a manufacturing defect, affecting a small number of phones, which it soon fixed. But customers online continued reporting problems, forum comments show. Some consumers damaged their phones when exposing them to water and Samsung had refused to honor warranty claims, the ACCC said in the lawsuit, though Samsung said it complied with all of its warranty obligations under Australian law. The regulator also said Samsung’s advice to some Galaxy model users that the phones were not suitable for beach or pool use suggested the firm considered water could cause damage. Samsung showed the Galaxy phones used in situations they shouldn’t be to attract customers, Sims said. Samsung’s advertisements, we believe, denied consumers an informed choice and gave Samsung an unfair competitive advantage. The ACCC alleges law breaches occurred in more than 300 advertisements. If proven, each breach after 1 Sept. 2018 can attract a fine of up to A$10 million ($7 million), triple the benefit of the conduct or as much as 10% of annual turnover. Breaches prior to 1 Sept. 2018 can attract penalties as high as A$1.1 million. Rival Sony settled a US class action over similar claims for its Xperia smartphone range in 2017, promising refunds where the phones had failed. REUTERS.

Huawei to be treated as blacklisted,"WASHINGTON: A senior US official told the Commerce Department’s enforcement staff this week that China’s Huawei should still be treated as blacklisted, days after US President Donald Trump sowed confusion with a vow to ease a ban on sales to the firm. Trump surprised markets on Saturday by promising Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan that he would allow US companies to sell products to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. In May, the company was added to the so-called Entity List, which bans American firms from selling to it without special permission, as punishment for actions against US national security interests. Trump’s announcement on Saturday – an olive branch to Beijing to revive stalled trade talks – was cheered by US chipmakers eager to maintain sales to Huawei, the world’s largest telecoms equipment maker and a key US customer. But Trump’s comments also spawned confusion among industry players and government officials struggling to understand what Huawei policy he had unveiled. In an email to enforcement staff on Monday that was seen by Reuters, John Sonderman, Deputy Director of the Office of Export Enforcement, in the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), sought to clarify how agents should approach license requests by firms seeking approval to sell to Huawei. All such applications should be considered on merit and flagged with language noting that This party is on the Entity List. Evaluate the associated license review policy under part 744, he wrote, citing regulations that include the Entity List and the presumption of denial licensing policy that is applied to blacklisted companies. He added that any further guidance from BIS should also be taken into account when evaluating Huawei-related license applications. Huawei told Reuters earlier on Wednesday that founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei had said Trump’s statements over the weekend were good for American companies. Huawei is also willing to continue to buy products from American companies. But we don’t see much impact on what we are currently doing. We will still focus on doing our own job right, a Huawei spokesman said in an email. The Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A person familiar with the matter said the letter was the only guidance that enforcement officials had received after Trump’s surprise announcement on Saturday. A presumption of denial implies strict review and most licenses reviewed under it are not approved. It is unclear when the Commerce Department will provide its enforcement staff with additional guidance, based on Trump’s promises, and how that might alter the likelihood of obtaining licenses. The internal memo, not previously reported, came as White House advisers also scrambled to shed light on Trump’s announcement. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro noted on Tuesday that the government would allow lower tech chip sales to the company, which don’t impact national security. The United States has accused Huawei of stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions. It has launched a lobbying effort to convince US allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure, citing concerns the company could spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations. REUTERS.

Scientists conclude cigar-shaped interstellar object not an alien spaceship,"WASHINGTON: After investigating the nature of a mysterious and apparently cigar-shaped object called ‘Oumuamua spotted in 2017 speeding through our solar system, astronomers remain uncertain over how to classify it, but are confident it is not an alien spaceship. Its odd shape and motion had prompted some scientists to wonder whether ‘Oumuamua – the first object from another star system found passing through our solar system – was some sort of alien technology perhaps exploring the cosmos. But after poring over the data, an international team of researchers wrote that we find no compelling evidence to favor an alien explanation. Scientists tracked the reddish-colored ‘Oumuamua from Oct. 14, 2017, until Jan. 2, 2018, after which it became too faint to detect even using the most powerful telescopes. It is estimated to be a half-mile (800 meters) long, tumbling through space. Our key finding is that ‘Oumuamua’s properties are consistent with a natural origin, and an alien explanation is unwarranted, said University of Maryland astronomer Matthew Knight, co-leader of the research published in the Nature Astronomy. Yes, if it made a sudden, unexplainable turn that would certainly have warranted further exploration, Knight added. ‘Oumuamua (pronounced oh-MOO-uh-MOO-uh) was first detected by the University of Hawaii’s Pan-STARRS1 telescope. Its name in the native Hawaiian language means a messenger arriving from a great distance. Knight said it is not easy to fit ‘Oumuamua into familiar classifications such as a comet or asteroid. We have tried to avoid putting it in one of those boxes and prefer to call it more generically an ‘object,’ Knight said. In simple terms, asteroids are rocky and devoid of ices, while comets are a mixture of rock and ice, so-called ‘dirty snowballs,’ Knight added. ‘Oumuamua was somehow ejected from a distant star system, traversing through interstellar space and through our solar system. It deviated slightly from a path that would be explained purely by the Sun’s gravitational pull because of what some researchers said was apparently a very small emission of gas from its surface, indicative of a comet, though any such emission was so slight as to be undetected. It lacked a dust tail or gas jets, characteristic of comets. The researchers wrote that a straightforward explanation for ‘Oumuamua is that it is a planetesimal – a planetary building block – or a fragment of one – formed in faraway star system. Its composition remains a mystery, including whether it is just rock or includes some metal or other ingredients. It is currently located beyond Saturn, dashing out of our solar system. REUTERS.

Facebook’s Libra coin likely to run a regulatory gauntlet,"NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO: Facebook Inc will face unprecedented regulatory scrutiny over a new digital currency that the social media company hopes will become globally recognized legal tender within a year. Since Facebook unveiled its cryptocurrency, called Libra, 10 days ago, Reuters has spoken with more than a dozen people with experience in financial regulation, financial technology, payments or cryptocurrency. Few expected government agencies to proceed lightly. The company’s announcement was met with immediate backlash from US lawmakers and regulators across the globe, who are concerned that Facebook is already too massive and careless with users’ privacy. Randal Quarles, chair of the Financial Stability Board, which coordinates financial rules for G20 countries, warned this week that wider use of crypto-assets for retail payments needs close global scrutiny by regulators. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin remain one of the least-regulated areas of finance. It’s a complete disaster from a regulatory perspective, said Barry Lynn, executive director of antitrust advocacy group the Open Markets Institute. This is a corporation that’s got fires all over the world with regulators. It’s only going to get worse. The plan for Libra involves taking customer deposits, investing them in government bonds, holding traditional currencies in reserves and offering cross-border services and transacting in the new coin will require engagement with central banks, financial regulators and enforcement authorities around the globe. The Facebook subsidiary formed to handle Libra transactions, called Calibra, has applied for money-transfer licenses in the United States and registered with the US Financial Crimes and Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a money services business, a spokesman said. It has also applied for the license required to operate a cryptocurrency business in New York from the state’s Department of Financial Services, a person familiar with the matter said. Representatives of Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority, the Bank of England, and Switzerland’s financial regulator FINMA have also said Facebook has been in touch. The scrutiny that we’ve seen is something that we expected and welcome, a Facebook spokesman said. We announced this early by design in order to have this discourse in the open and gather feedback. Reserves would be subject to monetary policies of countries where funds are located, the spokesman said. Calibra does not plan to apply for local banking licenses, he added. Facebook also formed a Geneva-based association to govern the new coin and hold the reserves, alongside several major partners. They plan to launch the whole system in the first half of 2020, and intend to eventually offer a broad suite of financial services, including loans. They will not get a free pass anywhere, said Sean Park, Founder and Chief Investment Officer, at Anthemis, a venture capital firm that backs digital financial services companies. And, given their intention to be global, they will ultimately need literally hundreds, perhaps thousands, of licenses from hundreds of different regulators across the globe. Besides central banks, markets regulators, consumer protection watchdogs, and agencies that tackle money laundering, tax evasion and other financial crimes, Facebook’s payment network might also have to adhere to the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures that are set by the Bank for International Settlements and the International Organization of Securities Commissions. There are also the privacy and antitrust regulators around the globe with whom Facebook is already battling. Just in terms of new regulators, it’s a whole new ball game, said Jeff Bandman, a former US Commodities Futures Trading Commission official who now runs the fintech regulatory consultancy Bandman Advisors. A year is enough time to meet with regulators, figure out where the real trouble spots are and potentially scale it back to something narrower. But its a challenge that Facebook appears willing to take, given the potential payoff with its 2.4 billion users, and the prospect of replicating the success of Chinese social networks such as WeChat, which has grown profits by offering financial services on its apps. RBC analysts described Libra as a potential watershed moment for Facebook in terms of revenue and user engagement. However, the costs could be substantial before income starts rolling in. It will need to set up an internal compliance framework with staffers who screen transactions for illicit activity and verify customer identities. Money-transfer giant Western Union Co for instance has spent $1 billion in compliance over the past five years, a spokesman said.

National Security concerns: US blocks more Chinese tech firms,"The US Commerce Department blacklisted five Chinese tech entities Friday in a new move against Beijing’s supercomputing industry likely to raise tensions ahead of a meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping next week. The notice targets Sugon — a prominent Chinese supercomputer manufacturer — along with three of its microchip subsidiaries and a computing institute owned by the People’s Liberation Army. All of the entities will be effectively barred from obtaining US technology after the government determined they were acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. Trade tensions between the world’s top two economies have spilled over into the tech sector in recent months, with Trump’s administration moving to essentially ban Chinese tech firm Huawei from the huge US market on security grounds. In May, it added Huawei to an entity list of companies barred from receiving US-made components without permission from Washington, though the company was granted a 90-day reprieve. Facebook and Google have since both announced they will move to cut off Huawei in order to comply with the US sanctions, further isolating the Chinese tech giant. Beijing has responded with threats to release its own blacklist of unreliable foreign companies and individuals that appears aimed at pressuring foreign companies to maintain commercial relations with Huawei. Earlier this month, Beijing summoned executives from American firms Dell and Microsoft and South Korea’s Samsung, among others, to warn them that any moves to ramp down their businesses in China may lead to retaliation, The New York Times reported. Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi are set to meet next week on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan.

Indonesian group slams ‘fatwa’ on popular game PUBG,"JAKARTA: An Indonesian group on Wednesday slammed a ‘fatwa’ on a hugely-popular but brutal online game, citing insult to their religion and making players addicted and violent. The religious edict, issued in conservative Aceh province, comes after officials in Iraq, Nepal, and India’s Gujarat banned Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) over fears it incited real-world violence. Often likened to the blockbuster book and film series The Hunger Games, PUBG pits marooned characters against each another in a virtual fight to the death and has become one of the world’s most popular mobile games. On Wednesday, the Aceh chapter of Muslim-majority Indonesia’s powerful Ulema Council called on local residents to ditch PUBG and said the local government should consider an outright ban. Breaking the ‘fatwa’ would not result in sanctions, it said, but the group’s national chapter has also been mulling a similar call to ditch violent games. The edict in Aceh would apply to other violent games but the Council did not say which. Our fatwa says that PUBG and other similar games are haram [forbidden] because they can trigger violence and change people’s behaviour, Aceh Ulema Council Deputy Chairperson Faisal Ali said. It also insults Islam, he told AFP, without elaborating how it does so. Religious officials were alarmed at PUBG’s soaring popularity among Aceh’s mostly Muslim residents. We’ve seen that children and, even adults, in Aceh are starting to get addicted to the game and they’re playing it everywhere on their mobile phones, Ali said. It’s getting worrying. He added. At the tip of Sumatra island, Aceh is the only region in Indonesia with Islamic law and where public flogging is a common punishment for a range of offences, including selling alcohol, adultery, and same-sex relationships.

COAS calls for public-private partnership in Pakistan’s defence industry,"Web Desk – (Syed Ahad Hussain) RAWALPINDI: Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa on Friday stressed on the need for enhanced cooperation between the public and private sectors to transform Pakistan’s defence industry into a vibrant, self-reliant and self-sustained entity. The Army Chief, while addressing the two-day national seminar Defence Production – Security through Self Reliance being held at the Army Auditorium in Rawalpindi, said that apart from public sector and defence production organisations, a fully integrated private sector was much needed in Pakistan’s defence industry. COAS added, there is a need to amplify indigenization through fully integrated public and private organizations in defence production for meaningful progression in the defence of the country. Gen Bajwa thanked participants for giving time to an important issue concerning national security. The seminar was aimed to pave way for self-reliance by exploring indigenous defence production potential, identifying organisational and institutional challenges of the defence industry, pragmatic solutions to optimise defence production, and recommending policy level measures to have the private sector fully immersed in defence production, said the official press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). Participants of the seminar included members from different ministries, public and private organisations, chambers of commerce and industries, defence production establishments, and members from academia. The representatives from the public sector suggested ways forward for public-private partnership in defence production, according to the military media wing. Minister for Defence Production Zobaida Jalal and Minister for Science and Technology Chaudary Fawad Hussain shared their views and suggestions for the development of Pakistan’s defence industry into a prolific entity. Representatives from the private sector also shared a roadmap for enhancing public-private partnership in defence production. Advisor to PM on Commerce, Abdul Razak Dawood, showed the participants importance of an independent defence industry for national security. The establishment of a taskforce under Prime Minister Imran Khan for a roadmap to facilitate indigenous defence production, establishing a raw material industry, incorporating the private sector for raw material base so as to optimally utilise public sector capacity for indigenous defence production, surplus defence potential for export, establishing ‘Digital Parks’ to tap software industry potential, and promoting research and development in universities were among the key recommendations.

Moonwalkers tell what it’s like on the Moon,"Twelve American men walked on the Moon between 1969 and 1972, with most describing in great detail their experiences on the dusty, low-gravity world lit by the blinding light of the Sun. Here are their impressions, collected from a series of oral history interviews by Nasa during the 1990s and 2000s, unless otherwise stated. Right after landing That’s where you experience the most quiet moment a human being can experience in his lifetime. There’s no vibration. There’s no noise. The ground quit talking. Your partner is mesmerised. He can’t say anything. The dust is gone. It’s a realisation, a reality, all of a sudden you have just landed in another world on another body out there (somewhere in the) universe, and what you are seeing is being seen by human beings, human eyes, for the first time. Gene Cernan, Apollo 17 Totally black sky We had a few moments to look around, to look up in the black sky ─ a totally black sky, even though the Sun is shining on the surface, it’s not reflected; there’s no diffusion, no reflection ─ a totally black sky and seeing another planet: planet Earth […] You think to yourself, just imagine that millions of people are living on that planet and don’t realize how fragile it is. Alan Shepard, Apollo 14 The horizon I was surprised by the apparent closeness of the horizon. I was surprised by the trajectory of dust that you kicked up with your boot, and I was surprised that even though logic would have told me that there shouldn’t be any, there was no dust when you kicked. You never had a cloud of dust there. That’s a product of having an atmosphere, and when you don’t have an atmosphere, you don’t have any clouds of dust. I was absolutely dumbfounded when I shut the rocket engine off and the particles that were going out radially from the bottom of the engine fell all the way out over the horizon, and when I shut the engine off, they just raced out over the horizon and instantaneously disappeared, you know, just like it had been shut off for a week. That was remarkable. Neil Armstrong, Apollo 11 There’s a problem on the Moon. Your ─ with depth perception, because you’re looking at objects you’ve never seen before, so a big object far away looks very similar to a smaller object close in. You don’t have any pole ─ telephone poles or houses or trees or cars to sit and judge scale like we did […] down here on Earth. Charlie Duke, Apollo 16 A lazy lope There seems to be no difficulty in moving around ─ as we suspected. It’s even perhaps easier than the simulations of one-sixth g that we performed in the various simulations on the ground. It’s absolutely no trouble to walk around. Armstrong to Mission Control shortly after descending from Apollo 11’s lunar module.  I started jogging around a bit, and it felt like I was moving in slow motion in a lazy lope, often with both of my feet floating in the air. One of the pure joys of being on the Moon was our somewhat lightfooted mobility. Apollo 11’s Buzz Aldrin in his book Magnificent Desolation: The Long Journey Home from the Moon I would say that balance [while walking] was not difficult; however, I did some fairly high jumps and found that there was a tendency to tip over backwards on a high jump. One time I came close to falling and decided that was enough of that. Armstrong during his 1969 technical debrief The gloves The biggest problem is that the gloves are balloons […] to pick something up, you have to squeeze against that pressure, 3.7 psi […] That squeezing against that pressure causes these forearm muscles to fatigue very rapidly. Just imagine squeezing a tennis ball continuously for eight hours or ten hours, and that’s what you’re talking about. Harrison Schmitt, Apollo 17 Hardened soil Getting the flagpole to stand in the lunar surface was more difficult than we anticipated… For the first time a shot of panic seared through me. Since childhood I had seen pictures of great explorers planting their flags in their new worlds. Would I be the first to plant the flag and have it fall over? Aldrin in Magnificent Desolation Nasty dust I noticed some of the moon dust on the floor [of the lunar module]. It had a gritty charcoal-like texture to it, and a pungent metallic smell, something like gunpowder or the smell in the air after a firecracker has gone off. Neil described it as having a ‘wet ashes’ smell. Aldrin in Magnificent Desolation An epiphany All of a sudden I realised that the molecules of my body and the spacecraft and my companion were prototyped in an ancient generation of stars. And somehow it suddenly became very personal instead of an objective: ‘Oh, yes. Molecules and atoms were made in those stars.’ No. My molecules were made in those stars, and this was a ‘wow!'

IHC declares arbitration council’s permission mandatory for second marriage,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court declared on Sunday the permission from the arbitration council mandatory for second marriage, regardless of the husband having prior permission from the first wife. In a 12-page statement issued today by IHC’s Chief Justice Athar Minallah, the court declared mandatory to take the arbitration council’s permission prior to the second marriage. The court ruled, a man who intends to contract another marriage during the subsistence of an existing marriage has to observe the procedure and fulfill the conditions prescribed by the legislature otherwise the consequences of imprisonment or fine or both could ensue. According to Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961: During the subsistence of an existing marriage, no man shall contract another marriage except with the previous permission in writing of the arbitration council. According to Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961: During the subsistence of an existing marriage, no man shall contract another marriage except with the previous permission in writing of the arbitration council. The IHC was hearing a case related to a Kashmiri citizen Liaquat Ali Mir’s acquittal, declaring its earlier decision null and void. Under the Muslim Family Law Ordinance 1961, the person doing second marriage without permission is liable to punishment and fine, stated the court. The factors required to be taken into consideration by the Arbitration Council in granting permission for contracting a subsequent marriage have been prescribed in subsections (2), (3) and (4) of section 6 of the Ordinance of 1961. Making it mandatory to obtain permission from the Arbitration Council for an already married man before contracting a subsequent marriage, the court ruled, a husband who contracts another marriage during the subsistence of an earlier one in contravention of the provisions of the Ordinance of 1961 definitely exposes himself of the risk of being imprisoned or fined or to both. The court made it evident that despite the first wife’s agreement if the arbitration council disagrees with the decision then the person will be liable to punishment.

Former Premier Benazir Bhutto’s 66th birth anniversary today,"The 66th birth anniversary of Pakistan’s iconic former prime minister Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto is being celebrated today. Benazir was born on 21st June 1953 in Karachi to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Nusrat Bhutto. She belonged to an influential political family which became a dynasty in Pakistan. She left for the esteemed Harvard University at the age of 16 to pursue her higher education. After receiving her undergraduate degree at Harvard, she got enrolled in England’s Oxford University. The political situation of Pakistan was turbulent at the time when the former prime minister was acquiring her education. Her father, who was heavily criticized by the political right over his reforms and nationalization of industries, was imprisoned and hanged by military ruler General Zia-ul-Haq on a murder charge in 1979. After Bhutto’s hanging, Benazir led a movement for restoration of democracy in Pakistan against the military rule. She was put under house arrest and was exiled later. She settled in London where she continued to oppose the military dictator. Benazir’s youngest brother, Shahnawaz Bhutto, was mysteriously killed in 1985 in an apartment in France. She returned to Pakistan only to be held for allegedly inciting the masses against the government.  The political scenario of the country received shockwaves when she announced her return to Pakistan in 1986. Hundreds of thousands of people arrived at Lahore to greet her and the movement against the military government of General Zia started to gain momentum. General Zia was killed in a plane crash in Bahawalpur on 17th August 1988 and the interim rulers called general elections in the country. At the age of 35 years, Benazir Bhutto was elected the Prime Minister of Pakistan after Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) emerged victorious in the polls. She holds the honor to be the first woman Head of Government of any Muslim country. However, her government was dismissed by than president Ghulam Ishaq Khan on allegations of corruption and mismanagement in August 1990. She was again re-elected as Prime Minister in 1993. Her aim was to make Pakistan a progressive country with equal opportunity for all citizens. Things did not turn out smoothly as Benazir wanted. In her second tenure, her brother Mir Murtaza Bhutto emerged as a fierce opponent of Benazir led government. He was slain in a police encounter in Karachi during her reign in 1996. Bhutto was again dismissed from office in 1996 and the Parliament was dissolved whereas her husband Asif Ali Zardari was imprisoned for many years. She again went into exile where she continued her fight for democracy. She decided to return to Pakistan on 18th October, 2007 despite grave threat to her life from rightist militant groups. She was greeted by a crowd of hundreds of thousands on her home-coming in Karachi. However, the celebration turned into grief as her welcome procession was attacked by twin suicide blasts at Karsaz in Karachi. The attack left more than a 100 people dead. Weeks before the general elections in the country, she targeted in a gun and bomb attack when she was returning after addressing an election rally at Liaquat Bagh of Rawalpindi. The attack in which she was killed with scores of her party activists, jolted the political landscape of the country and triggered a frenzy of anarchy and arson attacks that was resulted in billions of rupees losses to the country. Benazir Bhutto is considered one of the most dynamic figures in the world politics and her struggle for democracy was posthumously honored and acknowledged in the world. On the night of 5 August 2009, while he was staying with his second wife at his father-in-law’s house in Zangara, a US drone attacked the premises subsequently killing the main perpetrator who supposedly carried out the attack but questions still remain unanswered and Pakistan’s hierarchy is yet to produce facts to the general public. Benazir’s son and PPP chairperson, on Friday said Benazir was a great daughter of this motherland. Despite of being elected PM twice, her government was eradicated. Shaheed Bibi promoted mutual understanding between the federacy and the provinces, he added. PPP is following her mission and the day is not far away when the sun of truth will rise which was irrigated by Bibi, Bilawal further added.

Iconic Amjad Sabri’s third death anniversary being observed today,"KARACHI: The 3nd death anniversary of eminent Qawwal Amjad Sabri is being observed today, 16th Ramazan, 2019. Sabri, 40, and an associate were travelling in a car in Liaquatabad 10 area, when unidentified gunmen fired at their vehicle, critically injuring him. The two were shifted to Abbasi Shaheed hospital immediately, where Sabri succumbed to his injuries. Both front side windows were shattered and three bullet holes could be seen on the front screen. Amjad Sabri was the nephew of qawwali icon Maqbool Sabri who passed away in 2011. Maqbool Sabri along with his brother, the late Ghulam Farid Sabri, formed a formidable qawwali group in the mid-50s and became known for their soul-stirring renditions of arifana kalam (mystic poetry). Nearly three years after Pakistan´s foremost qawwali singer Amjad Sabri was gunned down in Karachi, the devotional music of Sufi mystical sect is struggling to survive, as fears of sectarianism and modern pressures slowly drown out its powerfully hypnotic strains. Thousands poured into the streets near Sabri´s family home after his death for his funeral, a rare public display of affection in Karachi. He was a rockstar of the masses, explained journalist and musician Ali Raj, who studied under Sabri. His murder was just the latest in a series of blows in recent years to strike at the heart of qawwali, which has thrived in South Asia since the 13th century. I am still in shock, Sabri´s brother Talha told AFP from his family home adorned with pictures of his superstar sibling, whose fame spanned the subcontinent and beyond. Why do they hate qawwali? Why do they hate music? Embraced widely as a part of Pakistan´s national identity, qawwali has played a key unifying role, with city-dwellers and villagers flocking to Sufi shrines for concerts. Performances traditionally last hours, with a troupe of musicians interweaving soulful improvisational threads under lyrical, lilting vocal lines to a steady beat of thundering rhythms on dholak and tabla drums and hand clapping, sending fans drifting into trance-like transcendent states. The genre entered a golden age in the 1970s as singers known as qawwals battled for prestige, with the Sabri Brothers — led by Amjad´s father, Ghulam Farid Sabri — and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan finding audiences around the world. Following the death of Ghulam, Amjad took the helm and slowly carved out his place as Pakistan´s most prominent qawwal, becoming a fixture on national television and radio. But now musicians worry that his murder — and the fear it sparked — has hastened the decline of qawwali. Fear, faith and finances
At Cafe Noor in Karachi where qawwals have gathered for decades, musicians said business has been falling for years, with fewer shrines willing to host performances. Militants have targeted Sufis for years. Just months after Sabri was killed, Daesh claimed back-to-back attacks on shrines in the provinces of Balochistan and Sindh that killed more than 100 people combined. Earlier this month, the military approved death sentences for two militants linked to Sabri´s killing. But questions linger over who ordered the murder — the Pakistani Taliban, or another group — forcing his brother to spend months guarded by elite paramilitary rangers. Such fears, meanwhile, are not the only factors triggering qawwali´s decline. Inflationary pressures have also kept the qawwals´ working-class fanbase from hosting shows. Increasingly only the middle class or elite can afford to pay a qawwali group to perform at parties or weddings. In the good old times, even a poor man… would manage to organise qawwali, explained singer Hashim Ali, saying he is now lucky to play four or five shows during religious periods compared to dozens in the past. The rise of more globalised interpretations of Islam has similarly chipped away at qawwali´s popularity, as Muslims in Pakistan increasingly depart from the subcontinent´s syncretic religious traditions and look to the Middle East for guidance. People access… (qawwali music) as a part of their faith, said Ahmer Naqvi, chief operations officer for Pakistani music app Patari. A lot of the younger population is abandoning the ways that the older generations worshipped. Increasing conservatism has also hit the genre. Even before Karachi´s Abdullah Shah Ghazi Mazar shrine — famed for hosting performances — was attacked by the Taliban in 2010, organisers had imposed restrictions on shows for years as part of a campaign against qawwali´s hashish-smoking fans. The pressure has compelled more qawwals to try their hand at fusion, or even branch into more financially viable genres such as pop. Only a minority have embraced social media to promote themselves, journalist Raj said. But they face an uphill battle. The youth… they don´t know what exactly qawwali is, said fan Muhammad Saeed, 24, citing the popularity of contemporary music at home and from abroad, during a private show in Islamabad. ´Under pressure´
After 16 years playing by his brother´s side, Talha Sabri said he has struggled to find his place on stage until Amjad´s own sons are old enough to perform. We are under pressure, he said, with his long hair and neatly trimmed beard cutting a stark resemblance to his brother. But even as he fears the possibility of extremists striking again, he refuses to be cowed. Regardless of these threats, we have to keep on, he said. For Sabri´s mother Asghari Begum however, the murder of her son marked a turning point for qawwali, ringing the death knell for its future. Her family previously made it through the tumultuous 1980s, when political parties and gangs battled for turf, turning Karachi´s streets into killing fields. But they were respected then, passing unscathed through the city´s numerous pickets. Amjad´s death proved things have changed.

"E-cigarettes, ‘smoke-free’ products do not help reduce cancer: WHO","GENEVA: Electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products are not helping fight cancer, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday, urging smokers and governments not to trust claims from cigarette firms about their latest products. The seventh WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic said blocking the industry’s interference was critical to cutting the harm from tobacco use. The tobacco industry has a long history of systemic, aggressive, sustained and well-resourced opposition to tobacco control measures, the report said. While some strategies are public and others more covert… all have the goal of weakening tobacco control. The report said tobacco giant Philip Morris International was trying to position itself as a responsible public health partner via its Unsmoke campaign, which encourages people to change to a better alternative. The WHO said the campaign aimed to ensure tobacco remained socially acceptable, while confusing consumers with terms such as smoke-free products, which may refer to products with toxic emissions and unknown short-term and long-term health effects. Philip Morris spokesman Ryan Sparrow said the WHO’s message made it harder to provide safer options for people who cannot quit smoking. There is no question that the best choice for smokers is to quit cigarettes and nicotine altogether. The reality is many people do not. We cannot turn our backs on them, he said. Organisations like the World Health Organization need to stop talking at smokers and start listening. The WHO report said the industry hoped to win respectability through manipulative messages such as claiming their products were part of a harm reduction strategy, even though cigarettes still account for 97% of the global tobacco market. Vinayak Prasad, programme manager of WHO’s tobacco control unit, said development of new products was solely intended to expand the markets of tobacco firms. There is no difference between cigarettes and heated tobacco products except that in terms of exposure: the exposure is less and the smoke is not visible, he said. Electronic cigarettes, containing nicotine but not tobacco, were promoted as a way to quit smoking. But there was no evidence to justify the claim, and evidence from the United States showed they had increased the prevalence of young people smoking, he said. So it’s also a gateway for young people, Prasad said. The answer is it needs to be regulated. WHO has clear guidelines – to get electronic cigarettes regulated. And if you are banning it, fine, but if you aren’t banning it don’t let it (go) free in the market, because the young people are taking it up. REUTERS.

Injured Italian rescued by Pak Army after 48 hours on Karakoram peak,"ROME: Pakistani military helicopters have rescued an Italian climber 48 hours after he suffered serious injuries in a fall in the northern Karakoram mountains, officials said on Monday. Francesco Cassardo, a 30-year-old doctor from the northern Piedmont region, on Saturday gave up on reaching the 6,955-metre summit of Gasherbrum VII and was returning to base camp when he fell, Italian media reported. Climbing companion Carlo Alberto Cimenti, 43, said Cassardo had hit several rocks before stopping at around 6,300 metres. The Pakistani army said that Cassardo has a broken femur as well as neck trauma. Rescue helicopters were unable to reach Cassardo over the weekend, citing rarefied air because of higher temperatures at high altitude. On Sunday, four climbers from Poland and Canada arrived to help, bringing the injured climber down to base camp at 5,900 metres on an improvised stretcher. There two Pakistani army helicopters landed at dawn on Monday and took Cassardo to an army base in nearby Skardu for medical attention. Great news we were expecting.

FaceApp viral amid fears of privacy,"You might want to think twice before you use viral selfie app FaceApp. The two-year-old app, which lets you alter photos of your face, once again shot to the App Store’s top spot this week after celebs and others began sharing doctored photos of themselves. Like some of Snapchat’s popular face filters, you can change photos of yourself so you appear older or younger, orswap genders. It’s a familiar gimmick at this point – and not one that’s new for FaceApp— but the app has gone viral all the same. It’s currently one of the most downloaded apps for both iOS and Android, as #faceappchallenge posts have taken over social media. But with the sudden surge in popularity have come new questions about privacy, and whether FaceApp is doing enough to protect users’ data. Some have questioned why the app, which has been out for years, suddenly went viral all over again seemingly overnight. Others have pointed to the fact that the app requires a data connection, suggesting that might be indicate the app is surreptitiously grabbing users’ photos. (Multiplesecurity researchershavesaidthere is no evidence that the app is sweeping up entire photo libraries.) And, in some corners of Twitter, people have pointed to the app’s Russian origins — FaceApp is owned by a company, Wireless Lab, that’s based in St. Petersburg — as a sign of something nefarious. While there’s as yet no evidence to support these claims, some other concerns are less far fetched. In a post-Cambridge Analytica world, in which thousands of people had their personal data misused because of a seemingly innocuous personality quiz, people are rightfully wary of the numerous ways their data could be accessed or exposed by an app developer.  And we don’t need to look far to find examples of photo apps taking their users’ photos for uses far beyond what’s required for their own apps. Earlier this year,NBC reportedthat Ever, a popular photo storage app, was using its users’ photos to train facial recognition software it then sold to law enforcement. IBM was also found to beusing Flickr photosto train facial recognition applications without permission from those in the photos. And last year, PopSugar’s viral twinning app inadvertentlyleaked data.

Theme based restaurants changing Islamabad’s food landscape,"ISLAMABAD: Young entrepreneurs have converted youth’s inclination of watching western TV series/seasons into an innovative business idea as the twin cities are witnessing an increase in theme-based restaurants. With detailed work on aesthetics and matching themes, the owners of these cafes make sure that visitors get the complete environment of their favourite TV shows while eating quality food with friends and family. Some of these famous restaurants include ‘King’s Landing café’ with the theme of hit American TV series ‘Games of Thrones’, ‘The Smokey Cauldron’ and ‘Café Crossbones’ with the theme of famous fiction series ‘Harry Potter’ while ‘Burnout Restaurant’s’ theme is based on famous film Cars. Owner of The Smokey Cauldron, Muhammad Haider Khan, told APP that the idea behind this café was to benefit from lack of such theme restaurants. We were the pioneer of this trend in the city as we wanted to create a nice place where Harry Potter fans can work on their laptops, maybe read a book and have a mug of coffee, he added. Most of the owners of these restaurants were fresh graduate engineers who were unable to find a good job so they put their creativity to good use. Game of Thrones-themed Café was the creative product of five young graduates, Qasim Bin Tariq, Ali Saif, Moiz Hashmi, Hammad Anwar and Arslan Sajid who graduated from FAST University with engineering degrees. We pursued our entrepreneurial venture after realizing that the formula for success is to provide modern-day consumers with a unique experience and memories associated with a product or service, Qasim said. He said they did not want to open just another café so they decided to do a experiment in their business with exploring the theme of hit TV show ‘Game of Thrones’ (GOT). ‘Burnout’ restaurant was also standing out as the first ‘Car themed’ restaurant in Pakistan based on the famous American film Cars. Talking to APP, the manager of the restaurant said they offered great ambience to their visitors with a unique interior that revolves around different features of the movie. We wanted to make sure that being the only car-themed café our visitors can get the feel of their favourite movie franchise’, he added. Ahmad, one of the visitors at Howdy, a cowboy-themed restaurant in F-7, said that having such creative eateries provide a sense of culture in the city. Islamabad may not have its own cuisine but this evolving culture of theme restaurants is serving us well. They present a lot of option to dine out on weekends in enjoyable ambience with friends and family, he said. Being home to a large number of foreign workers and diplomats, this trend in the capital was offering a wide variety of ethnic and foreign cuisines and bringing a refreshing change in the city’s food landscape.

Last Volkswagen Beetle drives into the sunset,"PUEBLA: Volkswagen rolled the last Beetle off the assembly line on Wednesday, the end of the road for a car that ran from Nazi Germany through hippie counterculture but failed to navigate a swerve in consumer tastes toward SUVs. Serenaded by a mariachi band and surrounded by proud factory workers, the final units of the retro, rounded compact were celebrated at a VW plant in Mexico’s central Puebla state more than 80 years after the model was introduced in Germany. The Puebla factory, which already produces VW’s Tiguan SUV, will make the Tarek SUV in place of the Beetle starting in late 2020, Volkswagen de Mexico Chief Executive Steffen Reiche said. The bigger vehicles are more popular in the United States, the main export market for the Mexico factory. The last Beetles will be sold on Amazon.com in a move symbolizing the company’s embrace of the future, Reiche said. Today is the last day. It has been very emotional, he said. The current design was the third version of the Beetle after two earlier cancellations and revivals of the marque. The bug, as the Beetle was nicknamed, debuted in 1938 as an affordable vehicle commissioned by Adolf Hitler to promote car ownership among Germans. With its funky design and inexpensive price, the car became a success story over subsequent decades and was one of the top-selling models of all time as well as the best-selling import in the United States in the 1960s, according to auto publications. In the 1960s, the Beetle was a small-is-beautiful icon of the postwar Baby Boom generation. The 1968 movie The Love Bug, which featured a zany anthropomorphic vehicle, stoked Beetle fever. Despite its place in popular culture, sales of the Beetle have been lackluster in recent years. The German automaker announced in September that the Beetle would go extinct. REUTERS.

Chicken meat causing rising rates of PCOs across the world,"By: |Simra Shahab| Since 1955 had the most astounding scope of beef, mutton, and then chicken. Be that as it may, because of ascent of costs, people moved to chicken as it is the most reasonable type of meat utilization. Soon, chicken replaced mutton as the prices for mutton meat reached sky high and since the middle class crisis, the public shifted to chicken, beef and then mutton. The high rates of population increase since 1955 from 40 million to 2 billion today 2019 require considerable amount of meat production. Hence, Imran Khan contributed to a better plan for the future crisis with the ‘egg and chicken’ plan. For the colonised minds when desis talk about chickens combating poverty they get mocked, but when walaitis talk about desi chicken and poverty it’s brilliance! https://t.co/bjvQQIVoRv — Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) December 1, 2018  Stats show us how poultry surpassed mutton in the nick of time ever since prices shook high. Not only that but it has affected the health of public, especially in women since chicken consumption is the most common, due to the reason stated above and the nutrients of meat and mutton are low, which is also the reason that 1 out of 5 people or children in general 1 have depleted hemoglobin levels. This issue shall be discussed in the latter part but first we need to know the root cause of how and why it happened. https://www.google.com/search?q=chart+of+meat+consumption+in+pakistan&rlz=1C1CHBD_enPK818PK818&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwimo_zCg6XjAhUgVBUIHYD7A9kQ_AUIECgB&biw=1137&bih=675#imgrc=yh4n30R-4CRImM: How did Occur? Ever since the demand of chicken consumption, keeping in mind the population rise, the poultry industry had to make it up to the requirement. However, it wasn’t a simple task at all since in 1977 avian flu spread which led to the death of most of the parent flock. Nevertheless, Pakistan was especially successful in controlling exceedingly pathogenic avian flu. With help from the FAO, Pakistan set up a reference research facility and a countrywide checking program. The main episode of HPAI in Pakistan happened in 1995, when HPAI serotype H7N3 was accounted for in reproducing stocks from business poultry cultivating and brought about overwhelming mortality and a serious drop in egg generation. In 1999, another serotype of low pathogenic avian flu developed is as yet common all through the nation. The infection rose again in November 2003 in the southern city of Karachi, primarily influencing business layers. The infection was in the long run constrained by separating and immunization procedures before the finish of 2005. The infection returned in 2007 and 2008. Out and out 22 episodes, basically in rearing rushes, have been accounted for. From July 2008 to 2011, no new instances of H5N1 were recorded in Pakistan. https://hospitals.aku.edu/pakistan/diseases-and-conditions/Pages/polycystic-ovary-syndrome.aspx Demand and Drawbacks Stuck between demand and the flu prevailing really brought damage to the poultry industry. As indicated by Nazir (2013), Pakistan has not been effective in creating explicit pathogen free (SPF) chickens, and experiences high feed costs (Tauqir and Nawaz, 2001) alongside low quality feed containing elevated amounts of mycotoxins (Saeed et al., 2009). Taking this in account, farmers and breeders reached for a cost effective method by choosing cheaper feed and injections that boosts the growth of chicken sooner than the natural time. This does not only messes with nature but is harmful for consumption as well. A significant number of women have been diagnosed with PCO (Polycystic ovary syndrome) is a condition that affectsa woman’shormone levels.Women withPCOs develop hormonal imbalance that causes to trigger higher than normal amounts of male hormones. This not only causes them to skip menstrual periods but also makes it harder for them to get pregnant, which directly affects fertility. Since it has impacted a major chunk of Pakistanis, people are either opting for desi-chicken have started avoiding chicken meat in general. This may have a significant impact on the poultry industry as well as the ones who are still unaware of the harsh truth regarding the side effects of consuming chicken carried by the cow milk that is also the result of injections, and by no means it may be healthy. Is the Future safe? Still there are some poultry linked major problems exists in the country including seasonal price fluctuations, expansive and low-quality feed and different diseases of flocks especially bird flu. But as happened in the past, research is going on upon these issues and the researchers are optimistic that the issues will be resolved in the country in near future. As it must since it is alarming this day and may possibly haunt the following years to be. However, people should look into the overconsumption of certain meat, overconsumption of anything usually does prove to be hazardous.

Japan sending patent officials to US over Kim Kardashian “Kimono” flap,"TOKYO: Japan is to send patent officials to the United States to discuss the flap over Kim Kardashian’s Kimono brand underwear, the trade minister said on Tuesday. The reality TV star and businesswoman said on Monday she would rename her Kimono shapewear line after people in Japan said her use of the term was disrespectful. Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko said he was aware of Kardashian’s decision but still wanted there to be a careful examination of the matter. This has become a big deal on social media, Seko said during a regular press conference in Tokyo, adding that trademark issues fell under his jurisdiction. The kimono is regarded around the world as a distinct part of our culture, he said. Even in America, kimono is well known to be Japanese.

France’s Mirazur crowned world’s best restaurant,"SINGAPORE: Mirazur, on the French Riviera, was crowned No.1 at the World’s 50 Best Restaurants awards ceremony held in Singapore on Tuesday, lauded for its fresh and seasonal cuisine. The three-Michelin-starred restaurant in Menton climbed to the top from third last year, replacing Italy’s Osteria Francescana. Mirazur’s menu, which includes dishes like salt-crusted beetroot from the garden with caviar cream, is inspired by the sea, the mountains and produce from its own gardens, which cascade over three levels. Its Argentine-born chef Mauro Colagreco told Reuters he felt like he was in the sky after winning the award, which showed the world when you have a dream all is possible. He and his team accepted the prize carrying a banner that combined the flags of Argentina, France, Brazil and Italy. Launched in 2002, the 50 Best list has grown in prominence to rival the long-established Michelin star system. The ceremony in Singapore is the first to be held in Asia. After a change in the rules earlier this year, restaurants that previously topped the poll will no longer be eligible for the annual ranking. Past winners, including Osteria Francescana, joined a newly created Best of the Best category. René Redzepi’s re-opened Noma in Copenhagen, Denmark, debuted on the 2019 list at No. 2. In its previous incarnation, Noma won the top title in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014. Spain dominated the top 10 list with three restaurants. Asador Etxebarri in Axpe was ranked No.3 for showing off simple ingredients by grilling them, while Mugaritz was seventh and Disfrutar came ninth.

"Raw, fried or on a bun: the many ways Japan eats whale","MINAMIBOSO: Whale cutlets, sliced raw whale, deep-fried whale nuggets, whale bacon and whale jerky feature on the menu at the restaurant Yoko Ichihara runs – and that’s just a small sample of the ways Japan eats whale. Though Japan’s government maintains that eating whale is a cherished part of its food culture, nationwide consumption didn’t really take off until after World War Two and peaked in the early 1960s before falling as other protein sources became cheaply available. A 1986 global whaling moratorium made whale a pricey food that rarely appears on family tables or in ordinary supermarkets, with vendors relying on Japan’s scientific research whaling for their supply. Japan resumes commercial whaling on July 1. A lot of people came in after hearing that the research whaling had ended, worried that they couldn’t get whale anymore, Ichihara said. They were surprised to hear whale is taken in Japan too. True aficionados have endured, sating their whale cravings largely through speciality restaurants such as the one Ichihara, 42, operates in Minamiboso, just east of Tokyo. Traditional recipes include blubber with vinegar-miso sauce, thinly sliced whale tongue, whale steak, a hotpot where slices of whale meat are simmered with mizuna greens and, the simplest, raw whale dipped in soy sauce. Several restaurants have come up with whaleburgers, a patty of whale meat sandwiched between buns or pressed rice. Ichihara’s restaurant offers many of these, as well as a unique take on traditional whale treats: fried whale dressed with slivered vegetables and vinegar, grilled marinated whale steak, and raw whale chopped with miso and scallions. Aficionados say whale tastes somewhat like beef, but with a stronger flavor. Whaling advocates point to its high protein content and low carbon footprint compared with other meats. Ichihara’s mother-in-law, Yachiyo, praises it as an ideal food. When it’s in your mouth, it’s meat, but when it’s in your stomach it’s like fish, it’s light, she said. Whale represents only 0.1 per cent of Japan’s meat consumption, so proponents say getting the next generation to eat it is essential. Schools occasionally serve it for lunch, including some – like those in Chigasaki, a city west of Tokyo that is not a traditional whaling area – as a way of teaching children what people ate in the past. To make it appealing to students, whale is usually served as fried nuggets, often with a soy-ginger sauce or ketchup, said Emi Yamaguchi, at the Chigasaki Board of Education. Since it’s such a rare thing, it’d be too bad to have lots left over, she said. It’s a special event so the kids are excited, and we make it in ways that appeal to them. The Ichiharas have taken part in whale-cooking contests to develop new dishes, with prizes going to items such as whale-filled spring rolls. A Minamiboso roadside store stocks whale-stuffed Chinese buns and whale ham along with more traditional items and cookies sold in boxes decorated with whales. REUTERS.

Dunn-Koczorowski and Szewczuk clearly see themselves as superior to the majority of society and they feel there duty is to express their beliefs, in turn teaching others, Detective Chief Superintendent Martin Snowden, head of counter-terrorism policing in northeast England. The considerable amount of material they have posted on social media channels not only reflects their extremist beliefs but was intended to encourage others to carry out despicable acts. Szewczuk was jailed for four years and three months while Dunn-Koczorowski was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Other posts by the men included support for Norwegian far-right mass killer Anders Breivik and backing for the neo-Nazi group, Sonnenkrieg Division. REUTERS.

Japan’s #KuToo campaign seeks ban on requiring women to wear high heels at work,"TOKYO: Japan’s health minister said in response to a petition seeking a ban on requiring women to wear high heels at work that such dress code expectations are necessary and appropriate in the workplace. Health Minister Takumi Nemoto responded on Wednesday to an online campaign gaining attention in Japan under the hashtag #KuToo, a play on the Japanese words for shoe, kutsu, and pain, kutsuu. The petition, which has collected 21,000 online signatures and is still growing, was submitted on Monday to the health ministry by Yumi Ishikawa, a 32-year-old funeral parlour worker. She said on Twitter in January she was required to wear 5-7 centimetre (2-3 inch) heels at work, causing her feet to hurt. Many Japanese companies may not explicitly require female employees to wear high heels but many women do so because of tradition and social expectations. I think it’s within the range of what’s commonly accepted as necessary and appropriate in the workplace, Nemoto said in response to a question from an opposition lawmaker in a parliamentary committee. However, Nemoto also said it could be considered power harassment if employers required female workers who had been injured to wear high heels. Ishikawa said on Thursday Nemoto’s comments had pushed the issue even more into the spotlight and wanted people to debate the issue seriously. It seems like men don’t really understand that wearing high heels can be painful and lead to injuries, she told Reuters. But even if women aren’t hurt, I’d like such expectations to be considered power harassment, she said. Ishikawa said Nemoto’s remarks might prompt some women to bring the issue up with their bosses. This might spur that kind of action, so I think this is going in a good direction, she said. The health ministry said it was reviewing the petition and declined to comment further.

"Meet ‘Digit’, the walking robot for Ford self-driving vans","Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it was partnering with walking robots maker Agility Robotics as it designs a planned fleet of self-driving delivery vans that will drop packages at the doorsteps of people’s homes. The United States’ second largest carmaker has been moving steadily on the development of full-service autonomous driving vans which it could potentially license out to companies ranging from Domino’s Pizza to Lyft or Target. It launched a self-driving pilot with delivery partners including Domino’s in Miami last year, and it said it was working on the best way to integrate Agility’s two-legged robot, Digit, into future vans. Digit is capable of lifting packages that weigh up to 40 pounds, can walk up and down stairs and through uneven terrain, while maintaining its balance after being bumped, Ford said. It’s not always convenient for people to leave their homes to retrieve deliveries, Ken Washington, Ford’s chief technology officer, said. If we can free people up to focus less on the logistics of making deliveries, they can turn their time and effort to things that really need their attention. After Ford bought Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based self-driving startup in 2017, the company has taken aim at providing autonomous vehicle service to multiple partners, who in turn would offer it to their customers under their own brand names. A Lyft customer, for instance, could schedule a ride from a Lyft mobile phone app in a Ford self-driving vehicle. But with spiraling development costs for autonomous cars in recent years, the company and other carmakers have sought alliances and outside investors. Ford has been in talks with Germany’s Volkswagen AG for an investment in the Argo unit, potentially saving billions in development costs. REUTERS.

McDonald’s faces 25 new sexual harassment lawsuits,"McDonald’s Corp has been accused in 25 new legal actions of condoning sexual harassment in the workplace and retaliating against employees who speak up. The new charges and lawsuits against one of the world’s most recognizable brands were announced on Tuesday by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the labor group Fight for $15, and the Times Up Legal Defense Fund, which wants to expand the #MeToo movement beyond prominent figures in Hollywood and elsewhere. McDonald’s said it has more than 14,000 locations in the United States, over 90 percent of which are franchised, with some 850,000 workers. The Chicago-based company has also long said it should not be liable for how employees in franchised restaurants behave. In letters sent this week to Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth and Top Chef host Padma Lakshmi, who is supporting the workers’ cause, McDonald’s Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said the fast food chain has improved and more clearly defined its harassment policies, and trained most franchise owners. McDonald’s is sending a clear message that we are committed to creating and sustaining a culture of trust where employees feel safe, valued and respected, Easterbrook wrote. The ACLU said the legal actions include three new civil rights lawsuits, two lawsuits by workers who previously filed charges, and charges filed by workers across the country with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. More than 50 such charges and lawsuits have been filed against McDonald’s in the last three years, the ACLU said. REUTERS.
