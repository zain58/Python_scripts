Malaysia ex-PM Najib goes on trial over 1MDB mega-scandal,"
MalaysiaÃ¢ÂÂs disgraced ex-leader Najib Razak pleaded not guilty to all charges against him as he went on trial on Wednesday over a multi-billion-dollar fraud, almost a year after his shock election loss.
The 65-year-old faced the first of several trials over his alleged involvement in the looting of sovereign wealth fund 1MDB, a state investment vehicle established to develop the economy of the Southeast Asian nation.
The former premier and his cronies are accused of plundering billions of dollars from the fund and spending it on everything from high-end real estate to artworks and a luxury yacht.

 He had been tipped to win another term in office easily last year and extend his coalitionÃ¢ÂÂs six-decade stranglehold on power, only to be soundly defeated by his former boss, Mahathir Mohamad, who rode a wave of public anger over 1MDB to the premiership.
In the months that followed, once-dormant investigations into the controversy were relaunched and Najib was hit with dozens of corruption charges linked to the plundering of the fund.
A small crowd of supporters was waiting for Najib as he arrived at the Kuala Lumpur court ahead of his trial, and he prayed with them for a few minutes before entering the building to shouts of Ã¢ÂÂLong Live NajibÃ¢ÂÂ.
Ã¢ÂÂNear absolute powerÃ¢ÂÂ
Looking relaxed in the dock, he denied seven corruption and money-laundering charges related to the alleged theft of 42 million ringgit from SRC International, a former 1MDB unit. It is just a fraction of the hundreds of millions of dollars that he allegedly stole.
Opening the prosecution, Attorney-General Tommy Thomas told the High Court it was the Ã¢ÂÂfirst trial in our courts against a former prime minister, who for nearly a decade occupied the most powerful office in the land and wielded near absolute power. Such privilege carries with it enormous responsibility.
Ã¢ÂÂThe accused is not above the law,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.
After the first witness, an official from the Companies Commission of Malaysia, gave largely technical evidence related to corporate records, the trial was adjourned.
The judge set the next hearing for April 15, and trial dates until May 10.
Najib left without commenting, to cheers from his supporters waiting outside court.
Far from being considered a pariah, the ex-leader has gained a following among members of the countryÃ¢ÂÂs Muslim majority as some are worried their long-held privileges are being eroded under the new government.
He has become an unlikely social media phenomenon by attacking the new administrationÃ¢ÂÂs policies online.

Saudi Arabia says 5 wounded as Huthi drones intercepted,"
Saudi air defences intercepted two drones launched by Huthis from neighbouring Yemen but debris wounded five civilians, including a child.
The drones targeted Khamis Mushait, home to a major airbase in the southwest of kingdom, coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Maliki said in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.
Ã¢ÂÂAt 9:35 pm (1835 GMT) on Tuesday, the Royal Saudi Air Defence systems detected two unidentified objects headed towards civilian (areas),Ã¢ÂÂ he said, adding they were Ã¢ÂÂintercepted and destroyedÃ¢ÂÂ.

 The Huthis have repeatedly fired ballistic missiles into Saudi Arabia in the past too.
Saudi Arabia has said the missiles were all intercepted by air defences, but one civilian was killed by shrapnel.
The Huthis say their missile attacks have targeted airbases from which a Saudi-led coalition has conducted a devastating bombing war since March 2015 in support of the Yemeni government.
Most of those killed in the conflict have been civilians, while millions have been brought to the brink of famine.

Ethiopian AirlinesÃ¢ÂÂ pilots followed Boeing guidelines before crash: WSJ,"
The pilots of the Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX plane that crashed last month initially took the emergency steps outlined by the manufacturer but still could not regain control, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.
The airliner went down soon after taking off on March 10, killing 157 people in the second deadly crash of a 737 MAX aircraft in less than five months, forcing a worldwide grounding of the model.
The first Ã¢ÂÂ a Lion Air crash in Indonesia that killed 189 people in October Ã¢ÂÂ led to Boeing issuing a bulletin reminding operators of emergency guidelines to override a specially developed anti-stall system on MAX planes.

 The pilots trying to regain control of the Ethiopian jet at first followed those procedures to switch off the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) but failed to recover control, the WSJ said, citing people briefed on the crash investigationÃ¢ÂÂs preliminary findings.
They then switched the system back as they tried to find other ways to control the jet before it crashed, the newspaper added.
Its sources said Ã¢ÂÂthe latest details are based on data downloaded from the planeÃ¢ÂÂs black-box recordersÃ¢ÂÂ.
The preliminary report on the accident will likely be issued this week, the Ethiopian government has said.

The MCAS is believed to have been a key factor in both 737 MAX crashes. It is designed to automatically lower the aircraftÃ¢ÂÂs nose if it detects a stall or loss of airspeed.
Before it crashed, the pilots of the Lion Air 737 MAX struggled to control it as the MCAS repeatedly pushed the planeÃ¢ÂÂs nose down, according to its flight data recorder.
Both the Lion Air and Ethiopian planes Ã¢ÂÂ MAX 8 models Ã¢ÂÂ reportedly experienced erratic steep climbs and descents, as well as fluctuating airspeeds, before crashing shortly after takeoff.
Ethiopia has said there were Ã¢ÂÂclear similaritiesÃ¢ÂÂ in the two crashes.
Boeing last week gathered hundreds of pilots and reporters for a presentation on proposed MCAS changes Ã¢ÂÂ including the system no longer repeatedly making corrections when pilots try to regain control.
The company is anxious to win approval for a remedy that could get the planes back in the air.
But the US Federation Aviation Administration (FAA), which faced harsh questioning last week at a congressional hearing regarding its oversight of Boeing, said it expected the plane maker to submit the proposed fix Ã¢ÂÂover the coming weeksÃ¢ÂÂ after it undertakes additional work.

"After ISI, ISPR is the new obsession for Indians","
Indians,including military strategists and media, have always been preoccupied with PakistanÃ¢ÂÂs militarypremier spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), but now the media wing of Pakistani armed forces, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), has become a new obsession for the neighbouring country.
Ã¯Â»Â¿
Although, it is an established fact that Pakistan wona victory in the 27 February dogfight with India, their formermilitarycommanders and intelligence specialists are also accepting that the South Asian giant, Pakistan, had a major lead in the war of information domain as well.

 Few days earlier, a retired Indian general had appreciated ISPR for employing Ã¢ÂÂoutstanding strategyÃ¢ÂÂ in the domain of hybrid warfare. Now, a prominent cyber-intelligence specialist is suggesting his Indian government to learn from the armyÃ¢ÂÂs media wing.
In an article published on Indian news websiteThe Print, the authorwarns his government that the ISPR is a next big threat for India after the ISI.
ISPR has been severely underestimated in the Indian strategic circles
Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs becoming increasingly clear that India has been late in spotting the danger: ifthere is a Pakistani inter-services directorate as lethal as the Inter Services Intelligence, it is, undoubtedly, the Inter-Services Public Relations.Ã¢ÂÂ
While giving his personal account as a cyber strategist, the author continues: Ã¢ÂÂI have always held the opinion that the role, or rather the potential, of the ISPR has been severely underestimated in the Indian strategic circles.Ã¢ÂÂ
Referring to the air strikes of Feb 27, he wrote Ã¢ÂÂPakistan had an undue structural advantage in the information battlespace.Ã¢ÂÂ
The author made his attempt to gauge the potential of the ISPR, and acknowledged that Ã¢ÂÂthe ISPR could have weaponised its mandate to wage a full-frontal cyber-enabled information offensive.Ã¢ÂÂ
Cautioning his government, the writer suggested that India should also imitate a department like ISPR.

Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a rocket ship up,Ã¢ÂÂ he said of the spending. Ã¢ÂÂPeople are paying and IÃ¢ÂÂm very happy.Ã¢ÂÂ

 Trump has long voiced skepticism about NATO, accusing Western allies of being freeloaders that do not pull their weight on military spending.
The Trump administration has been especially incensed with Germany, EuropeÃ¢ÂÂs largest economy, which is not on track to meet a 2014 pledge by NATO members to spend two percent of GDP on defense.
Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister, has stood behind Trump on the spending goals and credited his blunt approach with pushing members.
Between 2016 and the end of next year, the 28 NATO members other than the United States will have boosted military spending by $100 billion, Stoltenberg said earlier this year.
Trump said that he was also looking for a better relationship with Russia Ã¢ÂÂ now, as 70 years ago, seen as the primary threat by the Western alliance.
Ã¢ÂÂI hope we have a good relationship with Russia,Ã¢ÂÂ Trump said. Ã¢ÂÂI think weÃ¢ÂÂll get along with Russia.Ã¢ÂÂ
The comments come little more than a week after a long-awaited probe by former FBI chief Robert Mueller found no criminal collusion between TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs 2016 presidential campaign and Russia, according to a synopsis released by the Justice Department.

Trump steps back from Mexico border threat as companies warn of economic fallout,"
WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump took a step back on Tuesday from his threat to close the US southern border to fight illegal immigration, as pressure mounted from companies worried that a shutdown would cause chaos to supply chains.
Trump threatened on Friday to close the border this week unless Mexico acted. He repeated that threat on Tuesday but said he had not made a decision yet: Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre going to see what happens over the next few days.Ã¢ÂÂ
Closing the border could disrupt millions of legal crossings and billions of dollars in trade. Auto companies have been warning the White House privately that it would lead to the idling of US plants within days because they rely on prompt deliveries of components made in Mexico.

 The US Chamber of Commerce, the largest US business lobbying group, has been in contact with the White House to discuss the Ã¢ÂÂvery negative economic consequences that would occur across the country,Ã¢ÂÂ said Neil Bradley, the groupÃ¢ÂÂs top lobbyist, on a call with reporters.
Trump praised efforts by Mexico to hinder illegal immigration from Central America at its own southern border. On Monday, the Mexican government said it would help regulate the flow of migrants.
Ã¢ÂÂI really wanted to close it,Ã¢ÂÂ Trump said on Tuesday night at a fundraiser for congressional Republicans.
The Mexican government has not published apprehension statistics, but a senior White House official said it had provided daily updates to the Trump administration, including specific apprehension numbers.
Ã¢ÂÂThey say theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to stop them. LetÃ¢ÂÂs see. They have the power to stop them, they have the laws to stop them,Ã¢ÂÂ Trump said earlier on Tuesday.

"Reddit, Telegram among websites blocked in India","
MUMBAI: Websites like Reddit and Telegram are being blocked in India by internet service providers, throwing into question the enforcement of net neutrality rules, advocacy groups said on Wednesday.
Restrictions on Ã¢ÂÂtorrent sitesÃ¢ÂÂ that offer free movie and music downloads are routine in India to prevent copyright infringement. Pornography websites are also blocked by court orders seeking to protect children.
But in recent months, websites such as the discussion board Reddit, messaging service Telegram and comedy site College Humor have been blocked for intermittent periods, often for days and only in some regions, baffling internet users.

 Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs not making any sense, whatÃ¢ÂÂs happening,Ã¢ÂÂ said Apar Gupta, executive director at the non-profit Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF). Ã¢ÂÂA lot of these blocks are also happening in such a way that no notices are displayed.Ã¢ÂÂ
Since January, there have been at least 250 reports of websites blocked on networks operated by Jio, a unit of Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel and Hathway, the IFF said in a letter to the telecoms department.
Jio and Airtel are among IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs top telecom providers.
Some internet users have posted on social media screenshots of pages displaying messages saying a website was blocked to comply with government orders.
When Reuters tried to access CollegeHumor.com on Wednesday a message read: Ã¢ÂÂYour requested URL has been blocked as per the directions received from Department of Telecommunications, Government of India.Ã¢ÂÂ
An official at the telecoms department, which last year approved rules on net neutrality Ã¢ÂÂ the concept that all websites and data on the Internet be treated equally Ã¢ÂÂ declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Complaints by Indian internet users have covered Ã¢ÂÂmost forms of net neutrality violations,Ã¢ÂÂ IFFÃ¢ÂÂs Gupta said.
Nearly 60 percent of the user reports compiled by the foundation since January involved Jio networks, the IFFÃ¢ÂÂs data showed.
A Jio representative did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Hathway did not reply to phone and email requests for comment.
Bharti Airtel said in a statement it Ã¢ÂÂsupports an open internetÃ¢ÂÂ and does not block content unless directed by authorities. It did not say if it was currently blocking any websites.
Reddit did not respond to an emailed request for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.
Telegram, which has been blocked previously in Russia and Iran, did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment.
If websites are blocked based on government or court orders, or internet firms have legal grounds to restrict web pages, they might not violate net neutrality rules, said Gurshabad Grover, a researcher at the non-profit Center for Internet and Society.
Ã¢ÂÂBut in this case weÃ¢ÂÂre not entirely sure,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.
Other sites blocked this year include tax portal Taxscan and legal database Indian Kanoon.
After complaints from JioÃ¢ÂÂs internet users, Indian Kanoon founder Sushant Sharma said he had been told by Jio the portal was blocked for one day last week due to a government order.
Ã¢ÂÂBy evening, apparently, that order was taken back,Ã¢ÂÂ said Sharma, whose website has some 150,000 daily visitors.

Far-right Australian senator censured over Ã¢ÂÂuglyÃ¢ÂÂ Christchurch comments,"
A far-right Australian senator who said the Christchurch mosque massacre was the result of Muslim immigration into New Zealand was censured for his Ã¢ÂÂugly and divisiveÃ¢ÂÂ comments by his parliamentary peers on Wednesday.
Fraser Anning, who drew international condemnation for linking the March 15 killing of 50 people in two mosques last month to immigration, has refused to apologise for his views.
Politicians from major and minor parties joined forces to censure the controversial Queensland Senator in a voice vote in the upper house Senate.

 Ã¢ÂÂSenator AnningÃÂ´s comments were ugly and divisive. They were dangerous and unacceptable from anyone, let alone a member of this place,Ã¢ÂÂ leader of the conservative Liberal-National government in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, told the body.
Leader of the opposition in the Senate, LaborÃÂ´s Penny Wong, added that the censure was moved to Ã¢ÂÂtake a clear stand against hatred and extremist ideologyÃ¢ÂÂ.
Ã¢ÂÂWe must repudiate those who seek to spread intolerance and hate and in doing so undermine our democratic values,Ã¢ÂÂ Wong said.
Ã¢ÂÂThere is a difference between freedom of speech and hate speech. The former is a feature of our democracy; the latter is an attack on our democracy.Ã¢ÂÂ
Anning was elected in 2017 by a fluke of AustraliaÃÂ´s proportional voting system, having received only 19 first preference votes.
The independent senator has courted controversy for his views, and once called for a Ã¢ÂÂfinal solutionÃ¢ÂÂ to Australian immigration.
He is unlikely to be re-elected when Australians go to the polls next month.

Julian Assange breached terms of London embassy asylum: Ecuador president,"
QUITO, Ecuador: President Lenin Moreno of Ecuador told radio stations on Tuesday that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has Ã¢ÂÂrepeatedly violatedÃ¢ÂÂ the terms of his asylum in the Andean nationÃ¢ÂÂs London embassy, where he has lived for nearly seven years.
Moreno, interviewed by the Ecuadorean Radio BroadcastersÃ¢ÂÂ Association, said Assange does not have the right to Ã¢ÂÂhack private accounts or phonesÃ¢ÂÂ and cannot intervene in the politics of other countries, especially those that have friendly relations with Ecuador.
Attorneys for Assange did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

 Moreno made the comments on Assange after private photographs of him and his family at a time years ago when they were living in Europe circulated on social media. Although Moreno stopped short of explicitly blaming Assange for the leak, the government said it believed the photos were shared by WikiLeaks.
Ã¢ÂÂMr Assange has violated the agreement we reached with him and his legal counsel too many times,Ã¢ÂÂ Moreno said in the interview in the city of Guayaquil. Ã¢ÂÂIt is not that he cannot speak and express himself freely, but he cannot lie, nor much less hack private accounts or phones.Ã¢ÂÂ
Moreno did not say whether or not the government would take steps to remove Assange from the embassy.
Assange took refuge in EcuadorÃ¢ÂÂs London embassy in 2012 to avoid being extradited to Sweden, where authorities wanted to question him as part of a sexual assault investigation.
That probe was later dropped, but Assange fears he could be extradited to face charges in the United States, where federal prosecutors are investigating WikiLeaks.
Ecuador last year established new rules for AssangeÃ¢ÂÂs behaviour while in the embassy, which required him to pay his medical bills and clean up after his pet cat. He challenged the rules in local and international tribunals, arguing they violated his human rights. Both courts ruled against him.
Last month, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which is linked to the Organization of American States, rejected AssangeÃ¢ÂÂs request that Ecuador ease the conditions it has imposed on his residence in the London embassy.
Assange says Ecuador is seeking to end his asylum and is putting pressure on him by isolating him from visitors and spying on him. Ecuador has said its treatment of Assange was in line with international law, but that his situation Ã¢ÂÂcannot be extended indefinitely.Ã¢ÂÂ

Jet Airways grounds three-fourths of fleet,"
NEW DELHI: IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs Jet Airways has been forced to ground more than three quarters of its fleet after failing to pay lessors, as the debt-laden carrier struggles to secure bailout funds promised by state-run banks.
Jet struck a deal earlier this year to escape bankruptcy under which State Bank of India(SBI) and other lenders were to pump in $218 million and temporarily own a majority stake in the airline. But it has not got any of the funds so far and has not paid its employees for March, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
Once IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs leading full-service airline, Jet was founded 25 years ago by Naresh Goyal at a time when state-run carrier Air India was the only real formidable opponent. In recent years, however, Jet has struggled to compete with low-cost carriers such as IndiGo and SpiceJet that now dominate Indian skies.

 JetÃ¢ÂÂs operational fleet stood at 28 aeroplanes as of Wednesday, a company spokesman told Reuters, versus 119 planes last year.
At least 69 aircraft have been grounded due to money owed to lessors, showed stock exchange filings by Jet, while the remainder are out of service for maintenance.
Some lessors with direct knowledge of the matter said Jet had told them it would pay for one monthÃ¢ÂÂs rental and maintenance by the end of last week, but no payment had been received.
Ã¢ÂÂWe already have five to six months of delinquencies and we were promised just one month and even that hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been paid. This is very disappointing,Ã¢ÂÂ said one of the people, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Jet did not respond to specific queries on lessor and salary payments but said in a statement that the airline has informed the aviation regulator it is operating a curtailed schedule.
PRECARIOUS SITUATION
The Jet rescue plan itself has come under a cloud. It was based on a directive issued by the countryÃ¢ÂÂs central bank last year but IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs top court quashed that directive on Tuesday.
SBI and Jet did not respond to requests for comment on the court ruling. But some such as Madhukar Ladha, an equity analyst at Mumbai-based firm HDFC Securities, did not see JetÃ¢ÂÂs rescue package being in peril as the deal was already agreed.
After the bailout was announced, Jet told IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs aviation regulator it would not ground any more planes and would fly 40 more aircraft by the end of April, taking its operational fleet to 75 planes.
But late on Tuesday, Jet said it grounded 15 planes.
With a smaller operating fleet, Jet has given pilots and cabin crew the option of flexible working days and taking extended leave with or without pay, showed a note to staff reviewed by Reuters.
Even as the aircraft groundings are currently impacting JetÃ¢ÂÂs operations, the airline needs to rationalise its fleet and focus on profitable routes, said HDFC SecuritiesÃ¢ÂÂ Ladha.
Ã¢ÂÂThe situation remains precarious,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

"Visitors from Japan to Dubai surpass 100,000 mark for the firs time","
DUBAI: DubaiÃ¢ÂÂs Department of Tourism & Commerce Marketing has reported record growth in overnight visitors from Japan, crossing the 100,000 mark for the first time at the end of 2018. 
Reflecting a 15.3 percent year-on-year increase, the emirate welcomed 104,843 overnight visitors, with the robust growth underscoring efforts to further showcase the breadth of the cityÃ¢ÂÂs ever-expanding tourism proposition, cementing DubaiÃ¢ÂÂs ongoing commitment to the Japanese market.
Dubai Tourism says it adopted a custom market specific approach and tried to expand its reach across Japan targeting segmented demographics through strategic activations, always-on marketing campaigns and ongoing trade and business partnerships with key industry players.

 Ã¢ÂÂIn order to drive awareness and consideration around Dubai as a holiday destination among JapanÃ¢ÂÂs target market, the department identified women and senior citizens as key drivers in the travel and tourism space. Furthermore, building on the cityÃ¢ÂÂs commitment to ensure ease of accessibility, Japanese visitors benefit from daily flights from Tokyo Narita, Tokyo Haneda and Kansai International Airport in Osaka,Ã¢ÂÂ said a statement issued by Dubai Tourism.
Dubai Tourism led a campaign to showcase the city as a safe and exciting destination specifically targeting young female travellers. The campaign leveraged user videos and image posts, as well as inviting users to participate in ongoing competitions throughout the year to showcase DubaiÃ¢ÂÂs attractions to a broader audience. This campaign achieved 91.6 million impressions across a three month period, driving deeper engagement and encouraging wider conversations around Dubai.
Working to deliver an enhanced travel experience for Japanese visitors to the emirate, Dubai Tourism has partnered with a market leading travel agency in Japan to provide easy access to DubaiÃ¢ÂÂs travel products and information though sales and retail promotions across major Japanese cities.

DubaiÃ¢ÂÂs transport authority to open nine new bus routes,"
DUBAI: DubaiÃ¢ÂÂs Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has announced launching nine new bus routes and improving others from April 7.

"PakistanÃ¢ÂÂs growth rate to go down to 3.9% this year, says ADB","
ISLAMABAD: PakistanÃ¢ÂÂs economic growth rate to go down to 3.9% in fiscal year 2019, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said in a forecast on the countryÃ¢ÂÂs economy.
Ã¯Â»Â¿
The ADB in its publication titled Ã¢ÂÂAsian Development Outlook (ADO) 2019,Ã¢ÂÂ said PakistanÃ¢ÂÂs GDP growth to drop to 3.9% in FY2019 as Ã¢ÂÂmacroeconomic challenges will continue despite steps to tighten fiscal and monetary policies.Ã¢ÂÂ

 Ã¢ÂÂThe expansionary fiscal policy markedly widened the budget and current account deficits and drained foreign exchange,Ã¢ÂÂ the report observed.
The ADB report said inflation is expected to rise sharply to average 7.5% in FY2019, driven up by continued heavy government borrowing from the central bank, hikes to domestic gas and electricity tariffs, further increases in regulatory duties on luxury imports, and the lagged impact of currency depreciation by more than 10.7% since July 2018.
The water shortage would have an impact on the agriculture sector, which will fail to achieve its growth target, the bankÃ¢ÂÂs report said.
The ADB report forecast further hike in inflation by the end of the fiscal year.
The report has predicted decrease in the current account deficit but said it will remain on the higher side.
The country would have to borrow more to payback the external debt, the report further said.
Inflation will remain elevated at 7.0% in FY2020, it added.
Ã¢ÂÂFixed investment in FY2018 reflected higher public investment in infrastructure and energy, especially under the ChinaÃ¢ÂÂPakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project, including electric power projects,Ã¢ÂÂ ADB said.
Ã¢ÂÂNet exports weighed on growth as imports grew considerably faster than exports to meet rising demand for oil and capital products, notably to support infrastructure projects.Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂRemittances are expected to reviveÃ¢ÂÂhaving already risen by 10% in the first 7 months of FY2019 over the same period of FY2018Ã¢ÂÂas the Pakistan rupee depreciate further, economic activity in the Middle-eastern oil exporting countries (major destination of Pakistani migrants) holds broadly steady, and the government takes measures to facilitate remittances through official channels,Ã¢ÂÂ the bank report said.

Emirates NBD to buy TurkeyÃ¢ÂÂs Denizbank for $2.8 billion,"
DUBAI: DubaiÃ¢ÂÂs Emirates NBD said on Wednesday it will buy TurkeyÃ¢ÂÂs Denizbank from RussiaÃ¢ÂÂs Sberbank at a roughly 20 percent discount to a previously agreed price, after a steep fall in the Turkish lira.
Under a new agreement reached with state-owned Sberbank, DubaiÃ¢ÂÂs largest lender said it will buy TurkeyÃ¢ÂÂs fifth largest private bank for 15.48 billion lira ($2.8 billion), compared to the 14.6 billion lira announced in May.
Although the dealÃ¢ÂÂs lira value is higher, the dollar value when it was announced in May was put at the equivalent of $3.2 billion, about $400 million more that the new price.

 The lira has tumbled over concerns about the Turkish central bankÃ¢ÂÂs independence and AnkaraÃ¢ÂÂs worsening ties with Washington.
The Denizbank deal comes against a backdrop of TurkeyÃ¢ÂÂs strained relations with Gulf states since Ankara stood by Qatar after the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and others accused Doha of supporting terrorism, a charge it denies.
The transaction will help Emirates NBD diversify its business and establish itself as a leading bank in the region, the bankÃ¢ÂÂs vice chairman Hesham Abdulla al-Qassim said in May.
For RussiaÃ¢ÂÂs biggest bank by assets, the sale of SberbankÃ¢ÂÂs biggest asset outside Russia is part of a shift back to its home market. It bought Denizbank in 2012 for about $3.5 billion when it wanted to establish a presence abroad.
For Emirates NBD, the revised deal represents a discount of roughly 20 percent, a spokesman for the bank told Reuters, without providing further details.
Sberbank said it expected to receive $5 billion from the sale of Denizbank, including capital and debt. The news of the sale sent shares in Sberbank up 1.5 percent at market opening.
The sale price is based on DenizbankÃ¢ÂÂs capital plus 5 percent, according to international financial reporting standards, Sberbank said. The bank added that it expected the deal to be closed by the end of the second quarter of 2019.
DenizbankÃ¢ÂÂs equity amounted to 15.51 billion lira as of December 31, Emirates NBD said in a bourse statement, adding that the deal is expected to close by the end of the second quarter, subject to regulatory approval.

Ethiopian AirlinesÃ¢ÂÂ pilots followed Boeing guidelines before crash: WSJ,"
The pilots of the Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX plane that crashed last month initially took the emergency steps outlined by the manufacturer but still could not regain control, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.
The airliner went down soon after taking off on March 10, killing 157 people in the second deadly crash of a 737 MAX aircraft in less than five months, forcing a worldwide grounding of the model.
The first Ã¢ÂÂ a Lion Air crash in Indonesia that killed 189 people in October Ã¢ÂÂ led to Boeing issuing a bulletin reminding operators of emergency guidelines to override a specially developed anti-stall system on MAX planes.

 The pilots trying to regain control of the Ethiopian jet at first followed those procedures to switch off the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) but failed to recover control, the WSJ said, citing people briefed on the crash investigationÃ¢ÂÂs preliminary findings.
They then switched the system back as they tried to find other ways to control the jet before it crashed, the newspaper added.
Its sources said Ã¢ÂÂthe latest details are based on data downloaded from the planeÃ¢ÂÂs black-box recordersÃ¢ÂÂ.
The preliminary report on the accident will likely be issued this week, the Ethiopian government has said.

The MCAS is believed to have been a key factor in both 737 MAX crashes. It is designed to automatically lower the aircraftÃ¢ÂÂs nose if it detects a stall or loss of airspeed.
Before it crashed, the pilots of the Lion Air 737 MAX struggled to control it as the MCAS repeatedly pushed the planeÃ¢ÂÂs nose down, according to its flight data recorder.
Both the Lion Air and Ethiopian planes Ã¢ÂÂ MAX 8 models Ã¢ÂÂ reportedly experienced erratic steep climbs and descents, as well as fluctuating airspeeds, before crashing shortly after takeoff.
Ethiopia has said there were Ã¢ÂÂclear similaritiesÃ¢ÂÂ in the two crashes.
Boeing last week gathered hundreds of pilots and reporters for a presentation on proposed MCAS changes Ã¢ÂÂ including the system no longer repeatedly making corrections when pilots try to regain control.
The company is anxious to win approval for a remedy that could get the planes back in the air.
But the US Federation Aviation Administration (FAA), which faced harsh questioning last week at a congressional hearing regarding its oversight of Boeing, said it expected the plane maker to submit the proposed fix Ã¢ÂÂover the coming weeksÃ¢ÂÂ after it undertakes additional work.

Experts say the IMF will set difficult economic reform targets for Pakistan including a free-float exchange rate, which may result in further depreciation of the rupee.
Lately, in a historic surge on November 30, the value of the dollar shot up by Rs8 in the interbank market resulting the dollar rate to reach up to Rs 142 against Rs 134 trading on November 29.
The current account deficit was said to be reason behind the surge. However, the rupee had recovered against the dollar in the open market on December 3 as the greenback fell by Rs 3 to Rs 136.

"ISPR approaches Facebook, denies backing removed accounts: sources","
RAWALPINDI: Days afterFacebook claimed it removed pages, groups and accounts linked to Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR), the militaryÃ¢ÂÂs media wing has approached the the social media giant to deny its backing of the said accounts and pages, sources told ARY News on Wednesday.
The militaryÃ¢ÂÂs media wing not only denied backing or employing the people behind pages, accounts and groups which were removed in the exercise but has also approached Facebook to express reservations over claims that it was behind those accounts.
According to sources, ISPR has expressed its reservations over the claims made by Facebook that ISPR was managing these accounts or had employed people to run these accounts.

 ISPR also raised questions over FacebookÃ¢ÂÂs act of removing accounts highlighting the Kashmir issue and supporting PakistanÃ¢ÂÂs armed forcesÃ¢ÂÂs struggle.
The militaryÃ¢ÂÂs media wing also urged the social media giant to open its office in Pakistan for Ã¢ÂÂbetter understanding of the situationÃ¢ÂÂ on ground.
Facebook had made the announcement on April 1 and had said that the 24 pages, 57 accounts and 7 groups removed on Facebook had more than 2.8 million followers.
Ã¢ÂÂToday we removed 103 pages, Groups and accounts for engaging in coordinated inauthentic behaviour on Facebook and Instagram as part of a network that originated in Pakistan,Ã¢ÂÂ Nathaniel Gleicher, FacebookÃ¢ÂÂs head of cybersecurity, had said in a statement released on April 1, adding that they were linked to ISPR.

"Children in South Asia hardest hit by air pollution, says study","
Air pollution will shorten the life expectancy of children born today by an average of 20 months and will have the greatest impact in south Asia, according to a study published Wednesday.
The State of Global Air report, published by the US-based Health Effects Institute and the University of British Columbia, says air pollution is the fifth leading cause of early death worldwide Ã¢ÂÂ responsible for more deaths than malaria, road accidents, malnutrition or alcohol.
However it warns Ã¢ÂÂthe loss of life expectancy is not borne equallyÃ¢ÂÂ, with children in South Asia set to have their lives cut short by 30 months because of a combination of outdoor air pollution and dirty indoor air.

 In East Asia the study says air pollution will shorten childrenÃ¢ÂÂs lives by an estimated 23 months Ã¢ÂÂ compared with around 20 weeks for children in developed parts of Asia Pacific and North America.
The report, which uses data up to the end of 2017, estimates that if air pollution levels were brought within World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines Bangladesh life expectancy would see the highest expected gain, at nearly 1.3 years.
India, Nigeria, and Pakistan would all see average life expectancy increase by around one year.
Despite state reforms to reduce pollution levels, China remains the country with the highest mortality rate due to air pollution, responsible for around 852,000 pollution-related deaths in 2017.
The top five countries with the highest mortality rate due to air pollution were all in Asia: China, India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Bangladesh.
In total, the report says 147 million years of healthy life were lost in 2017 globally due to pollution.
Exposure to household air pollution Ã¢ÂÂ mostly from people burning coal, wood or charcoal to cook or heat their homes Ã¢ÂÂ is most common in South Asia, East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
Nearly half of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs population is exposed to household air pollution Ã¢ÂÂ including an estimated 846 million people in India and 452 million in China.
A study last October from the World Health Organization found that exposure to toxic air both indoors and out kills some 600,000 children under the age of 15 each year.
It found that children are often more vulnerable to the impact of air pollution since they breath more rapidly than adults, and thus absorb more pollutants at a time when their brains and bodies are still developing.
Data from the UN health body said that every day, 93 percent of children under the age of 15 breath dangerously polluted air.

S. Korea to launch worldÃ¢ÂÂs first national 5G networks,"
South Korea launches the worldÃ¢ÂÂs first fully-fledged 5G mobile networks Friday, a transformational leap that already has superpowers sparring for control of an innovation that could potentially change the day-to-day lives of billions of people.
The superfast communications heralded by fifth-generation wireless technology will ultimately underpin everything from toasters to telephones; from electric cars to power grids.
But while the South has won the race to be first to provide the user experience, that is only one part of a wider battle that has pit the United States against China and ensnared giants including Huawei.

 Hyper-wired South Korea has long had a reputation for technical prowess, and Seoul has made the 5G rollout a priority as it seeks to stimulate stuttering economic growth.
The system will bring smartphones near-instantaneous connectivity Ã¢ÂÂ 20 times faster than the existing 4G Ã¢ÂÂ allowing users to download entire movies in less than a second.
In the same way that 3G enabled widespread mobile web access and 4G made new applications work ranging from social media to Uber, 5G will herald a new level of connectivity, empowered by speed.
It is crucial for the future development of devices ranging from self-driving vehicles that send data traffic to one another in real time, industrial robots, drones and other elements of the Internet of Things.
That makes it a vital part of the infrastructure of tomorrow, and the 5G standard is expected to bring about $565 billion in global economic benefits by 2034, according to the London-based Global System for Mobile Communications, an industry alliance.

Ã¢ÂÂOne million devicesÃ¢ÂÂ
But the implications have pitted Washington against Beijing in an increasingly bitter standoff.
The US has pressed its allies and major economies to avoid 5G solutions from Chinese-owned telecom giant Huawei, citing security risks that technological backdoors could give Beijing access to 5G-connected utilities and other components.
But Chinese firms dominate 5G technology.
Huawei, the global leader, has registered 1,529 5G patents, according to data analysis firm IPlytics.
Combined with manufacturers ZTE and Oppo, plus the China Academy of Telecommunications Technology, Chinese entities own a total of 3,400 patents, it says Ã¢ÂÂ more than a third of the total.
South Korea comes next, with its companies holding 2,051 patents.
In contrast, US firms have 1,368 altogether, IPlytics said Ã¢ÂÂ 29 fewer than FinlandÃ¢ÂÂs Nokia alone.
All three of South KoreaÃ¢ÂÂs mobile networks Ã¢ÂÂ KT, SK Telecom and LG UPlus go live with their 5G services.
Ã¢ÂÂ5GÃ¢ÂÂs hyper speed can connect one million devices within a one square kilometre zone simultaneously,Ã¢ÂÂ KT said in a report.
On the same day, Samsung Electronics will release the Galaxy S10 5G, the worldÃ¢ÂÂs first available smartphone using the tech, with rival LG following with the V50s two weeks later.

Cost barrier
More than three million South Koreans will switch to 5G by the end of this year, predicted KT vice-president Lee Pil-jae.
Until now, no mobile networks have offered nationwide 5G access. In the US, hotspots in a few selected cities have offered 5G speeds but over wifi only, while Qatari firm Ooredoo says it offers 5G services in and around Doha, but does not have devices available to use them.
US network carrier Verizon will launch fifth-generation services for mobile users in Chicago and Minneapolis next week, with more than 30 cities due to follow this year.
Japan is also expected to roll out a limited deployment in 2019 before full services start in time for next yearÃ¢ÂÂs Tokyo Olympics.
But cost is likely to be a barrier for user uptake initially, analysts say: the cheapest version of the new Galaxy handset will be 1.39 million won ($1,200).
Ã¢ÂÂWhile there are many cheap 4G smartphones under $300, SamsungÃ¢ÂÂs 5G phones are well over $1,000, which could be a major minus point for cost-savvy consumers,Ã¢ÂÂ a KT representative told AFP.
None of South KoreaÃ¢ÂÂs three network operators would say how much they have invested in 5G Ã¢ÂÂ but SeoulÃ¢ÂÂs economy minister Hong Nam-ki put it at at least $2.6 billion this year alone.
Ã¢ÂÂIf 5G is fully implemented,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, Ã¢ÂÂit will greatly improve peopleÃ¢ÂÂs livesÃ¢ÂÂ.

Nearly a third of cat owners use food puzzles: study,"
Cat food puzzles are exactly what they sound like.
The puzzles can be any object that holds food and requires your feline friend to figure out how to get it. The puzzles come in all sorts of shapes and sizes.
Food could be cleverly hidden inside a ball or other mobile device and only by rolling it or pushing it will the cat capture the tasty treat. Other puzzles are stationary with cups or holes that require cats to fish out their wet or dry food with a paw.

 Thirty percent of cat owners surveyed use food puzzles, according to a new study led by researchers at the University of California, Davis. The puzzles benefit domestic cats by bringing out their natural foraging behavior.
Ã¢ÂÂBefore cats were domesticated, they lived in the wild where they hunted for food,Ã¢ÂÂ said lead author Mikel Delgado, a postdoctoral researcher on cat behavior at UC Davis. Ã¢ÂÂThen humans came along and took their jobs away.Ã¢ÂÂ
Delgado suggests owners throw away the food dish and make their cats return to work. Enrichment activities like food puzzles may improve their catÃ¢ÂÂs welfare by increasing mental stimulation, as has been demonstrated in several other species such as laboratory rats, zoo animals and pet parrots. Although no experiments have yet looked at whether food puzzles help cats with weight loss, Delgado co-authored a 2016 paper that presented case studies where food puzzles aided cats with weight loss, anxiety and urination outside the litter box.

Blaming the cat
The online survey, conducted from January to April of 2018, was designed to assess how cat owners fed their cats and their attitudes about cat food puzzles. It found only 30 percent of participants currently use a food puzzle, 18 percent had tried them but stopped using them, and 52 percent had never used a food puzzle.
People who had tried using cat food puzzles but stopped most commonly blamed the cat. Owners said their cat was too lazy or never figured them out.
Ã¢ÂÂWhen starting out with a food puzzle, itÃ¢ÂÂs important to make it easy for the cat at first so they can figure it out and not become frustrated,Ã¢ÂÂ said Delgado. Ã¢ÂÂAt the same time, you want to make sure itÃ¢ÂÂs challenging enough that it provides some activity and mental stimulation.Ã¢ÂÂ
Most healthy cats should be able to figure out and use a puzzle for a significant portion of their diets without too much assistance, Delgado added.
The most common reason for not ever having used a food puzzle was having a dog or multiple cats with different diets or weight goals, although 8 percent had never heard of food puzzles.
Ã¢ÂÂHaving multiple pets does not have to be an obstacle for using food puzzles,Ã¢ÂÂ said Delgado. Ã¢ÂÂPet owners can offer food puzzles under supervision, or use a baby gate to have a dog-free zone in their home where they can offer puzzles.Ã¢ÂÂ
Researchers said more work needs to be done to help cat owners provide an enriched environment for their cats.
They recommend that cat owners work with their veterinarians to come up with a plan for feeding their cats.
In total, 3,192 people completed surveys. The study was published in the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery.
The research was supported by funding from MaddieÃ¢ÂÂs Fund.

"US, China leading race for 5G wireless: survey","
WASHINGTON: The United States and China are in a virtual deadlock in the race for 5G, or fifth-generation wireless networks expected to unlock new services, an industry survey showed Tuesday.
The report shows the United States has closed the gap with China in Ã¢ÂÂreadinessÃ¢ÂÂ for the ultrafast wireless systems and has more 5G deployments planned in 2019 than any other country.
The study for the wireless industry group CTIA and conducted by the research firm Analysys Mason showed the US moved ahead of South Korea in 5G readiness over the past year to a virtual tie with China, as a result of considerable investment in 5G systems.

 CTIA president Meredith Attwell Baker said in a statement that the United States has made Ã¢ÂÂimpressive stridesÃ¢ÂÂ in preparing for the new technology but that more is needed to maintain leadership.
Ã¢ÂÂWe canÃ¢ÂÂt be complacent as the 5G race has really just begun,Ã¢ÂÂ she said.

Ã¢ÂÂWe must redouble our efforts to combat the 5G ambitions and investments by China and others.Ã¢ÂÂ
Analysts expect 5G networks to play a crucial role in delivering data for autonomous vehicles, remote medicine and other services with heavy data usage.
US officials have sought to block Chinese firms such as Huawei from deploying 5G systems on national security grounds, raising concerns that this will slow the rollout of high-speed networks.
Officials have also floated the idea of a government-backed 5G network which could be more secure against foreign espionage, an idea roundly opposed by the telecom industry.

According to the report, the US leads with 92 commercial 5G deployments planned for 2019 but noted that ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs wireless operators are conducting Ã¢ÂÂhundreds of large-scale 5G trials across the country.Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂChina retains a significant infrastructure advantage,Ã¢ÂÂ the report said. Ã¢ÂÂA recent study showed China with more than 14 wireless cell sites per 10,000 people, compared to 4.7 in the United States.Ã¢ÂÂ
The report said to maintain growth in 5G, the US needs to do more to allocate wireless spectrum, in some cases reassigning bands now used for other purposes.
According to the survey, South Korea ranked third in 5G readiness, followed by Japan, Britain and Italy.

WhatsApp launches fact-check service to fight fake news,"
MUMBAI: WhatsApp said on Tuesday it has launched a tip line for Indians to submit rumours and uncertain information, in the latest step by the messaging service to combat false news in India during the national election.
Facebook-owned WhatsApp said in a statement it was working with an Indian startup called Proto that will help to classify messages sent by users as true, false, misleading or disputed.
A senior WhatsApp executive said in FebruarysaidIndiaÃ¢ÂÂs political parties have been abusing the popular messaging service ahead of the countryÃ¢ÂÂs general election.

 Ã¢ÂÂWe have seen a number of parties attempt to use WhatsApp in ways that it was not intended, and our firm message to them is that using it in that way will result in bans of our service,Ã¢ÂÂ Carl Woog, head of communications for WhatsApp, told reporters.
WhatsApp has tried to curb the spread of fake news by educating users through roadshow campaigns, as well as print and radio advertising. It also limited the number of people someone can forward a message to at one time.
Such misinformation has led to the lynching of over 30 people since January last year, according to data portal IndiaSpend.

NASA terms IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs satellite destruction Ã¢ÂÂterrible thingÃ¢ÂÂ,"
The head of NASA on Monday branded IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs destruction of one of its satellites a Ã¢ÂÂterrible thingÃ¢ÂÂ that had created 400 pieces of orbital debris and led to new dangers for astronauts aboard the International Space Station.
Jim Bridenstine was addressing employees of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration five days after India shot down a low-orbiting satellite in a missile test to prove it was among the worldÃ¢ÂÂs advanced space powers.
Not all of the pieces were big enough to track, Bridenstine explained. Ã¢ÂÂWhat we are tracking right now, objects big enough to trackÃ¢ÂÂ weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about 10 centimetres (six inches) or bigger Ã¢ÂÂ about 60 pieces have been tracked.Ã¢ÂÂ

 The Indian satellite was destroyed at a relatively low altitude of 180 miles (300 kilometers), well below the ISS and most satellites in orbit.
But 24 of the pieces Ã¢ÂÂare going above the apogee of the International Space Station,Ã¢ÂÂ said Bridenstine.
Ã¢ÂÂThat is a terrible, terrible thing to create an event that sends debris at an apogee that goes above the International Space Station,Ã¢ÂÂ he continued, adding: Ã¢ÂÂThat kind of activity is not compatible with the future of human spaceflight.Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs unacceptable and NASA needs to be very clear about what its impact to us is.Ã¢ÂÂ
The US military tracks objects in space to predict the collision risk for the ISS and for satellites. They are currently tracking 23,000 objects larger than 10 centimetres.
That includes about 10,000 pieces of space debris, of which nearly 3,000 were created by a single event: a Chinese anti-satellite test in 2007 at 530 miles from the surface.
As a result of the Indian test, the risk of collision with the ISS has increased by 44 per cent over 10 days, Bridenstine said.
But the risk will dissipate over time as much of the debris will burn up as it enters the atmosphere.

Presence of life-indicating gas on Mars confirmed,"
The mystery of methane on Mars may finally be solved as scientists Monday confirmed the presence of the life-indicating gas on the Red Planet as well as where it might have come from.
In the 15 years since a European probe reported traces of the gas in the Martian atmosphere, debate has raged over the accuracy of the readings showing methane, which on Earth is produced by simple lifeforms.
Because methane gas dissipates relatively quickly Ã¢ÂÂ within around 12 years on Earth Ã¢ÂÂ and due to the difficulty of observing MarsÃ¢ÂÂ atmosphere, many scientists questioned previous studies that relied on a single data set.

 Now an international team of experts have compared observations from two separate spacecraft, taken just one day apart in 2013, to find independent proof of methane on our neighbouring planet.
Furthermore, they conducted two parallel experiments to determine the most likely source of methane on Mars to be an ice sheet east of Gale Crater Ã¢ÂÂ itself long assumed to be a dried up lake.
Ã¢ÂÂThis is very exciting and largely unexpected,Ã¢ÂÂ Marco Giuranna, from RomeÃ¢ÂÂs National Astrophysics Institute, told AFP.
Ã¢ÂÂTwo completely independent lines of investigation pointed to the same general area of the most likely source for the methane.Ã¢ÂÂ

EuropeÃ¢ÂÂs Mars Express probe measured 15.5 parts per billion in the atmosphere above the Gale Crater on June 16, 2013. The presence of methane in the vicinity was confirmed by readings taken 24 hours earlier by NASAÃ¢ÂÂs Curiosity rover.
Using the data, Giuranna and the team divided the region around the crater into grids of 250 by 250 square kilometres.
One study then ran a million computer-modelled emissions scenarios for each section while another team studied images of the planet surface for features associated on Earth with the release of methane.
Ã¢ÂÂIndicator of lifeÃ¢ÂÂ
The most likely source was a sheet of frozen methane beneath a rock formation, which the team believes periodically ejects the gas into the atmosphere.
Giuranna said that while methane is a sign of life on Earth, its presence on Mars doesnÃ¢ÂÂt necessarily constitute evidence of something similar on the Red Planet.
Ã¢ÂÂMethane is important because it could be an indicator of microbial life,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂBut life is not required to explain these detections because methane can be produced by abiotic processes.Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂThough not a direct biosignature of life, methane can add to the habitability of martian settings, as certain types of microbes can use methane as a source of carbon and energy,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.
Though there is no liquid water on Mars, the European Space Agency said in February its imaging equipment had shown further evidence of dried up river beds, suggesting the Red Planet may once have been home to simple organisms.
Giuranna said that further research was needed to determine the extent of the methane ice sheet near Gale Crater.
If founded to be extensive, the methane it contains Ã¢ÂÂcould support a sustained human presenceÃ¢ÂÂ on Mars as a possible source of fuel for industrial processes and a propellant for returning manned missions to Earth, he said.

Global shift to renewable energies can save millions of lives,"
Reducing global air pollution can prevent millions of premature deaths according to an international team of scientists, led by the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry.
The most significant contribution would be the rapid phasing out of fossil fuels, which is currently being discussed mainly to abate climate change.
The researchers used a global atmospheric chemistry and climate model, linked to the latest estimates of health effects in order to study the combined impact of decarbonisation on public health, precipitation and the climate.

 The results of the study have been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.
The team headed by atmospheric researcher Prof. Jos Lelieveld of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry calculated that fossil fuel generated emissions are responsible for about 65 percent of premature deaths from human-made air pollutants worldwide.
Polluted air significantly elevates the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
According to Prof. Richard Burnett of Health Canada, co-author of the study, it was recently found that the health burden of fine particulate matter is exceedingly high. Phasing out the use of fossil fuels would therefore prevent more than 3 million premature deaths annually worldwide.

Ã¢ÂÂIf all sources of air pollution from human activities could be eliminated, that number would further rise to more than 5 million per yearÃ¢ÂÂ, adds Prof. Andy Haines from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who is also a co-author of the study.
Air pollution also impacts the climate
Reduced air pollution would not only have a positive effect on human health but would also influence the climate. Although a global phase-out of fossil fuels would decisively slow down the increase in atmospheric CO2, the current level of around 400 ppm in the atmosphere would not diminish anytime soon.
On the other hand, air pollution from particulate matter in the atmosphere, which reflects some of the solar radiation and cools the Earth to a certain extent, would rapidly decline. For this reason, a global phase-out of fossil fuels would even lead to a short-term global temperature increase of about 0.5 degrees Celsius.
Nevertheless, it is still possible to limit warming to 2 degrees.
Ã¢ÂÂThe rise in temperature resulting from the removal of pollution particles from the air can be tempered by a simultaneous reduction of the greenhouse gases methane, ozone and hydrofluorocarbons in the troposphere,Ã¢ÂÂ explains Prof. Ramanathan of the University of California in San Diego, who co-authored the study.
Methane, ozone and hydrofluorocarbons are much shorter-lived than carbon dioxide, but they have a particularly strong near-term impact on the climate. Their reduction would therefore have a direct cooling effect, whereas the climate impact of the longer-lived CO2 will last for centuries.
More precipitation due to less particulate matter
Less particulate matter in the atmosphere and the consequent increase in sea surface temperature, will increase evaporation from the oceans. This would result in more rainfall in several regions plagued by drought. The effect is particularly pronounced in monsoon regions and could help improve food security and access to water for people in parts of Africa, notably the Sahel, Central America, northern China and India.
The main implication of the study is that fossil fuel phase-out is a major opportunity not only to slow down climate change, but also to significantly improve the health of people from around the world.
Therefore, the scientists advocate a rapid shift from fossil to renewable energies: Ã¢ÂÂClean energy sources have the potential to save many lives,Ã¢ÂÂ adds Lelieveld.

Australia sees record temperatures for fourth month in a row,"
SYDNEY: Australia continued a string of Ã¢ÂÂhottest everÃ¢ÂÂ months in March, the government said Monday, as global warming emerges as the hot button issue in national elections just weeks away.
The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said the country had experienced the warmest March on record, with mean maximum and minimum temperatures above average for nearly all of the vast continent nation.
BOM said the national mean temperature was 2.13 degrees centigrade (3.83 degrees Fahrenheit) above the long-term average for the month of March.

 It was the fourth month in a row of record heat in the country, and January was AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs hottest month ever, with mean temperatures across the continent exceeding 30 degrees Celsius for the first time.
There was some relief for regions suffering from prolonged drought, however, as two tropical cyclones that struck northern and western Australia in March bought badly needed rains.
Ã¢ÂÂUnfortunately, the rain needed to reduce significant rainfall deficiencies in drought-affected areas is substantial and will require above average rainfall over a prolonged period to completely remove deficits at longer timescales,Ã¢ÂÂ BOM said.
Meteorologists say weather patterns over the Indian and Pacific oceans have contributed to the higher temperatures, but that long-term climate change trends were also involved.
The problem of climate change has emerged as a key issue in national elections due to be held by mid-May.
The conservative coalition government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been reluctant to back steep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions blamed for contributing to global warming for fear this would hurt the countryÃ¢ÂÂs huge coal industry and undermine economic growth.
The main opposition Labor Party, which leads the conservatives in opinion polls, on Monday unveiled a raft of proposals to cut greenhouse gas emissions, including through promotion of renewable energy sources and electric motor vehicles.

First teaser trailer for Ã¢ÂÂJokerÃ¢ÂÂ lands,"
Warner Brothers and DC Movies on Wednesday released the first teaser trailer of their upcoming movie Ã¢ÂÂJokerÃ¢ÂÂ a day after releasing the first poster.
Directed by Phillips and starring Joaquin Phoenix in the title role, Joker is said to be a more adult take on the character that presents a new vision of his origin set outside the interconnected DC Extended Universe of Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Shazam.
Joker seems to take its inspiration from classic character dramas of the 1970s and 1980s like Taxi Driver, Dog Day Afternoon and The King of Comedy.

 
Warner Bros. has also launched the official Joker Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts.
Joker is scheduled to open on October 4 this year, and along with Phoenix stars Zazie Beetz, Robert De Niro, Marc Maron, Shea Whigham, Frances Conroy, Bill Camp and Glenn Fleshler.
About the character from DC Universe
Whether by way of award-winning films like Ã¢ÂÂThe Dark Knight,Ã¢ÂÂ Emmy-winning animated programs like Ã¢ÂÂBatman: The Animated Series,Ã¢ÂÂ video game appearances such as the record-breaking Ã¢ÂÂBatman: Arkham Asylum,Ã¢ÂÂ or the countless comics stacking comic book shelves and digital libraries, the Joker stands unquestionably as the most recognizable and popular comic book villain in pop culture history. Unpredictable, violent and incredibly dangerous, he is chaos personified and has taken on everyone from his archenemy Batman to even the Man of Steel.
But Gotham remains his primary home and Batman his biggest adversary, and no hero is perhaps better suited as in many ways, the Joker is the polar opposite of the Dark Knight.
Both were created by a great tragedy, but Batman has since vowed to do whatever it takes to prevent similar incidents, the Joker revels in creating chaos and destroying lives, believing that lifeÃ¢ÂÂs a big joke and psychotically demonstrating that in a moment, it can all change.
Not much is known about his past, but his acts during the present are what define the Joker as one of the greatest threats to our heroes and the people theyÃ¢ÂÂve sworn to protect.
HeÃ¢ÂÂs killed a Robin, crippled Batgirl, and tortured and murdered countless people throughout the DC UniverseÃ¢ÂÂall just for a laugh.

Rapper Nipsey Hussle killed over Ã¢ÂÂpersonal disputeÃ¢ÂÂ with suspect,"
LOS ANGELES: Police on Tuesday said the man named as a suspect in the fatal shooting of rapper Nipsey Hussle allegedly killed him two days ago over a personal dispute that was not gang-related.
Police said that Eric Holder, 29, of Los Angeles, was a suspect in the shooting and that he was still at large. He fled the crime scene in a Chevy Cruze driven by an unidentified woman, Police Chief Michel Moore told reporters.
Ã¢ÂÂWe are currently working with the district attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs office to seek the necessary information to obtain a warrant for his arrest,Ã¢ÂÂ Moore said during a news conference on Tuesday. Ã¢ÂÂWe believe this to be a dispute between Mr. Hussle and Mr. Holder.Ã¢ÂÂ

 Photos of the suspect, Eric Holder, were also being shown on different media channels.

Hussle, 33, whose real name was Ermias Asghedom, was shot multiple times on Sunday afternoon outside of his clothing store, Marathon Clothing, in south Los Angeles, and was rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Two other people were wounded in the shooting, police said.


The Grammy-nominated rapper found minor commercial success but was highly revered among his peers, and his shock death triggered an outpouring of tributes from hip hop royalty.
Long part of the underground rap circuit, Hussle struggled to find fame but began selling his own mixtapes, which rap king Jay-Z once bought 100 of for $100 each.
Hours before his death Hussle Ã¢ÂÂ whose youth was intertwined with Los Angeles gang culture Ã¢ÂÂ tweeted: Ã¢ÂÂHaving strong enemies is a blessing.Ã¢ÂÂ
HussleÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂVictory LapÃ¢ÂÂ scored a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album at this yearÃ¢ÂÂs ceremony.
It was his first formal album, which dropped after six years of teasing but ultimately lost the honor to rapÃ¢ÂÂs woman of the moment Cardi B.

Fakhr-e-Alam has a lot to say about Pakpattan man and his Ã¢ÂÂhomemadeÃ¢ÂÂ airplane,"
KARACHI:TV celebrity and aviation enthusiast Fakhr-e-Alam, whomade headlines last yearfor becoming the first Pakistani globetrotter, came out to strongly defendthe youthwho was apprehended on Sunday for attempting to operate a self-made Ã¢ÂÂflying deviceÃ¢ÂÂ.
A resident of Pakpattan, Mohammad Fayaz had indigenously designed an aircraft using readily available materials and was preparing to fly it in the Rang Shah neighbourhood of Pakpattan, but the Police seized his aeroplane and arrested him.
The police registered a First Information Report (FIR), according to which, Fayaz was apprehended for building an aircraft without a Ã¢ÂÂpermitÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂperforming aerobaticsÃ¢ÂÂ in the makeshift flying machine.

 Fakhr-e-Alam took to Twitter in support of Fayaz and asked Pakistanis to draw inspiration from his story. Ã¢ÂÂThis is the story you should share with the world & take pride in,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.

A man in a village near Pak Pattan made a small aircraft out of his own limited resources. This should be your story to look upto & be inspired by. This is the story you should share with the world & take pride in. This brings glory to Pakistan. DonÃ¢ÂÂt taint it.
Ã¢ÂÂ Fakhr-e-Alam (@falamb3) April 1, 2019

He continued in another tweet saying: Ã¢ÂÂThis young man deserves our appreciation and respect. Pakistan cannot be a country where technology & innovation is punished. He should be lauded & I would like to fly with him in his home made airplane. Anyone wants to arrest me please do I will surrender myself.Ã¢ÂÂ

The famed singer also urged Prime Minister Imran Khan to intervene in the matter and treat the homemade aeroplane maker as Ã¢ÂÂa national asset.Ã¢ÂÂ

Dear PM @ImranKhanPTI can you please tell your Punjab govt to intervene. This man should be interviewed & asked what made him do this & how he succeeded. This man should be treated as a national asset. These are the kind of stories that inspire youth & future aviators. https://t.co/paDSCfuQ53
Ã¢ÂÂ Fakhr-e-Alam (@falamb3) April 1, 2019

Fakhr-e-Alam also pointed out flaws in the education system of Pakistan, calling it Ã¢ÂÂterribleÃ¢ÂÂ. He asked people to encourage others Ã¢ÂÂdaring to innovate or exploreÃ¢ÂÂ in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

Pakistan is late on science & technology. Our education system is terrible. Private sector flourishes as education like health is a business rather than a public service. We MUST always go out of our way to support, encourage people daring to innovate or explore in STEM.
Ã¢ÂÂ Fakhr-e-Alam (@falamb3) April 1, 2019


In a series of tweets,the 42-year-old singer shed the light on the design of FayazÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂself-made flying machineÃ¢ÂÂ. He said the Pakpattan man Ã¢ÂÂwas putting together an ultra light kind of design. I am told he is a Labour worker. Self taught about aviation.

Govt committed to eradicate tuberculosis from country: Health Minister Kiani,"
ISLAMABAD: Minister for National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination Aamer Mehmood Kiani on Wednesday said the government was committed to eradicate tuberculosis (TB) from the country by creating awareness in public and ensuring treatment facilities for every patient.
Addressing the national seminar to launch Ã¢ÂÂTB-free Pakistan InitiativeÃ¢ÂÂ, Aamer Mehmood Kiani said the government had been focusing on TB, which was the largest killer amongst infectious diseases in Pakistan, with a very high morbidity and mortality rate.
He said the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination had been providing a clear and strategic direction to overcome this menace throughout the country.

 The minister said the National Strategic Plan 2017-2020 highlighted the priority action areas in line with Ã¢ÂÂEnd TB StrategyÃ¢ÂÂ, which were intended to provide great momentum, strategic depth and a mutually shared vision to the ongoing efforts for TB control ultimately leading to a TB-free Pakistan by 2030.
Read More:Govt formulating comprehensive strategy to eliminate TB: health minister
He said the Ã¢ÂÂEnd TB initiativeÃ¢ÂÂ was being strengthened by the guiding values of good governance, provision of high quality services, equity and a pro-poor approach with transparency and accountability in addition to developing a holistic approach with integration and cross sectoral linkages, as enshrined in the Declaration of the United Nations High Level Meeting on Tuberculosis that had been ratified and was being strictly pursued by Pakistan.
Ã¢ÂÂSuccessful implementation of the Ã¢ÂÂEnd TB initiativeÃ¢ÂÂ is strongly linked to effective coordination and collaboration with the Ã¢ÂÂProvincial Departments of HealthÃ¢ÂÂ, which needs to develop linkages with the other social sectors at provincial and district level,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.
In this regard, it was imperative that all provincial governments undertake the necessary steps instrumental for setting the Ã¢ÂÂEnd TB initiativeÃ¢ÂÂ into motion, through indigenous funding of the TB control mechanisms and programmes while engaging in the required multi-sectoral collaboration.
The minister emphasised the critical role of private sector, which needed to join hands with the government more robustly in the fight against TB with a view to eliminate this disease as soon as practicable.
Aamer Kiani said, Ã¢ÂÂWe have a sizable network of about 6,500 facilities integrated within the public and private healthcare system at all levels that offer free of cost TB diagnostic and treatment services in Pakistan. We are aware of the other costs that TB patients have to bear and are doing our best to reduce catastrophic costs.Ã¢ÂÂ

Cholera vaccination campaign begins in Mozambique,"
An oral cholera vaccination campaign to protect survivors of Cyclone Idai began in Beira city of Mozambique.
Funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the campaign will be carried out by the Mozambique Ministry of Health, with support from WHO and other partners, including UNICEF, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), MÃÂ©decins Sans FrontiÃÂ¨res (MSF) and Save the Children.
There has already been one reported cholera death and almost 1500 reported cases following the cyclone, which caused severe flooding in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Madagascar after making landfall in March. Nine cholera treatment centres, with 500-bed capacity, are already admitting patients.

 Ã¢ÂÂCyclone IdaiÃ¢ÂÂs trail of devastation has left the city of BeiraÃ¢ÂÂs water and sanitation infrastructure in ruins, providing the perfect conditions for cholera to spread,Ã¢ÂÂ said Gavi CEO, Dr Seth Berkley.
Ã¢ÂÂThis cyclone has already caused enough devastation and misery across south east Africa; we have to hope these vaccines will help stop a potentially major outbreak and prevent yet more suffering.Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂHundreds of thousands of people are living in terrible conditions in temporary settlements without safe drinking water and sanitation, putting them at serious risk of cholera and other diseases,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO.
Ã¢ÂÂThe key thing is to make sure that people can access rapid treatment and clean water and sanitation. The oral cholera vaccine is a vital emergency measure that will help save lives and stop the spread of this horrible disease.Ã¢ÂÂ
WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to coordinate the oral cholera vaccination campaign, including working with partners to ensure an appropriate cold chain storage and providing logistical support.
Cholera is endemic to Mozambique, which has had regular outbreaks over the past five years. About 2 000 people were infected in the last outbreak, which ended in February 2018.
The 884 953 doses of oral cholera vaccine arrived in Mozambique on Tuesday. They were taken from the global cholera vaccine stockpile, which is fully-funded by Gavi. Gavi is also supporting operational costs of the campaign. The use of the stockpile for outbreak response is managed by the International Coordinating Group (ICG), which features representatives from WHO, UNICEF, IFRC and MSF.
Since the stockpile was launched in 2013, millions of doses every year have helped tackle outbreaks across the globe. In the fifteen years between 1997 and 2012, just 1.5 million doses of oral cholera vaccine were used worldwide.
In 2018 alone, the stockpile provided 17 million of doses to 22 different countries. Since the beginning of 2019, more than 6 million doses have already been shipped to respond to outbreaks or address endemic cholera in many countries including Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Somalia and Zimbabwe.

Gluten-free pizza turned out to contain gluten in 53.2 percent of tests!,"
For people with celiac disease, even tiny amounts of gluten in foods can cause trouble, and restaurants may be the hardest places to avoid the hidden protein, a US study suggests.
More than half of gluten-free pizza and pasta dishes tested in restaurants were positive for the presence of gluten, and overall, about one third of supposedly gluten-free foods had some gluten, researchers report in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.
Ã¢ÂÂThe long-suspected problem of gluten contamination in restaurant foods that has been reported by patients likely has some truth behind it,Ã¢ÂÂ said senior study author Dr. Benjamin Lebwohl, director of clinical research at the Celiac Disease Center at New York Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.

 Ã¢ÂÂWe donÃ¢ÂÂt know how common it is. But our findings suggest that pizza and pasta and foods served during dinner time are more likely to have this problem.Ã¢ÂÂ
Lebwohl often heard anecdotally from patients that they suspected they had consumed gluten at restaurants, even though the foods they ate were labeled gluten-free.
When he learned that the manufacturer of the portable Nima Gluten Sensor had a stash of data submitted by restaurant patrons who used the device to test foods they suspected, Lebwohl asked if he could use the information in a study.
The company supplied what they had: 5,624 food tests performed by 804 users during an 18-month period. When the researchers analyzed the data, they found that 32 percent of tests revealed gluten contamination in dishes that were supposed to be gluten-free.
Gluten-free pasta samples were positive for the protein in 50.8 percent of tests, while gluten-free pizza turned out to contain gluten in 53.2 percent of tests. Gluten was detected in 27.2 percent of breakfasts, 29 percent of lunches and 34 percent of dinners.
Lebwohl admits there are a lot of limitations to the dataset. Ã¢ÂÂThe people tested what they wanted to test,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂAnd the users chose which results to upload to the company. They may have uploaded the results that surprised them the most. So, our findings donÃ¢ÂÂt mean that 32 percent of foods are unsafe.Ã¢ÂÂ
Moreover, Lebwohl said, the Nima is very sensitive. To be labeled gluten free in the U.S., a product must contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm). But the device can detect levels as low as 5 to 10 ppm, which Ã¢ÂÂmost people would not consider to be clinically significant. So, itÃ¢ÂÂs possible for a food to have less than 20 ppm and still indicate that gluten is present.Ã¢ÂÂ
The Nima gluten detector, which sells for about $229 and uses disposable $6 test strip capsules, displays a wheat symbol when it detects gluten and a smiley face when it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt, the authors note. It can upload results to the company via a smartphone app.
Lebwohl suspects that gluten-free foods are being inadvertently contaminated. Ã¢ÂÂIf a gluten-free pizza is put in an oven with a gluten-containing pizza, aerosolized particles could come in contact with the gluten-free pizza,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂAnd itÃ¢ÂÂs possible that cooking gluten-free pasta in a pot of water that had just been used for pasta that contained gluten might result in contamination.Ã¢ÂÂ
The solution, Lebwhol said, may be better education for food preparers.
About 1 percent of Americans have celiac disease, Lebwohl said. The amount of gluten needed to cause intestinal damage in these patients is tiny, he added. Ã¢ÂÂIt would be barely visible, like tiny crumbs of bread,Ã¢ÂÂ he explained.
While the limitations of the data mean itÃ¢ÂÂs not possible to determine what percentage of restaurant foods labeled gluten-free actually contain the protein, Ã¢ÂÂitÃ¢ÂÂs interesting to know that so many foods marked as gluten-free arenÃ¢ÂÂt,Ã¢ÂÂ said Therezia Alchoufete, a clinical dietician in the University of Pittsburgh Medical CenterÃ¢ÂÂs Digestive Disorders Center.
Ã¢ÂÂThis is definitely a consideration for anyone with celiac disease trying to eat outside of the home. At home they know they are preparing foods without any gluten-containing items.Ã¢ÂÂ The issue goes beyond gluten, Alchoufete said. Ã¢ÂÂThis could apply to anyone who has a sensitivity to a certain ingredient.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ebola virus likely to spread into Pakistan from South Africa,"
KARACHI: The chances of transmission of life threatening Ebola virus from South Africa to Pakistan, have increased.
As per reports, about 90 per cent of Ebola-affected patients lose the battle of life.
The virus is regarded as a symbol of terror worldwide, is now likely to make its way towards Pakistan as the thermo-scanners, fixed to detect Ebola virus, are out of order at the International Islamabad airport. The staff of health department also remains absent at the airport, as per sources.

 It is mandatory for passengers coming from Africa to be screened through thermo-scanner. On the directions of World Health Organization (WHO) in 2014, a scanner was installed at the Islamabad airport, however, the administration started to overlook the matter and kept sending a positive report to the WHO.
Key fact about Ebola virus:
As per WHO,

Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans.
The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission.
The average EVD case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.
The first EVD outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests. The 2014Ã¢ÂÂ2016 outbreak in West Africa involved major urban areas as well as rural ones.
Community engagement is key to successfully controlling outbreaks. Good outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, namely case management, infection prevention and control practices, surveillance and contact tracing, a good laboratory service, safe and dignified burials and social mobilisation.
Early supportive care with rehydration, symptomatic treatment improves survival. There is as yet no licensed treatment proven to neutralize the virus but a range of blood, immunological and drug therapies are under development.

E-cigarettes havenÃ¢ÂÂt made teen smoking cool again: study,"
PARIS: The rapid spread of e-cigarette use among young teenagers has not slowed the decline in smoking in the same age group, much less reversed it, according to a new study.
Nor has vaping caused 13-to-15 year olds canvassed in Britain to see tobacco use in a more positive light, researchers reported Tuesday.
The findings, published in the BMJ journal Thorax, are the latest to conclude that nicotine-delivering electronic cigarettes are not, as once feared, a gateway drug for tobacco.

 Ã¢ÂÂOur research does not support the hypothesis that e-cigarettes Ã¢ÂÂrenormalisedÃ¢ÂÂ youth smoking during a period of growing but largely unregulated use in the UK,Ã¢ÂÂ the study concluded.
But neither did it alleviate growing concern about the health consequences of vaping, which remain largely unknown in part because the practice is so new.
It took decades, experts point out, to determine that smoking tobacco Ã¢ÂÂ which accounts for more than seven million premature deaths worldwide every year Ã¢ÂÂ is truly dangerous.
Research on nearly 100,000 adults in the United States Ã¢ÂÂ presented at a major conference last month there Ã¢ÂÂ showed that e-cigarette use increases the likelihood of heart attacks, coronary artery disease and depression by 34, 25 and 55 percent respectively.
Rates of these conditions were far higher among smokers.
Another study from February, published in the Nature Journal Scientific Reports, linked chemicals used in 90 percent of vaping systems to impaired lung function.
Ã¢ÂÂWe must take aggressive steps to protect our children from these highly potent products,Ã¢ÂÂ the US Surgeon General said in a rare public advisory in December, warning of the harmful impact of nicotine on still-developing brains.
The new findings looked at changes in behaviour and attitude among a quarter of a million young teens in Britain from 1998 to 2015.
During that period, they found, the percentage of 13-to-15 years olds who had smoked at least once fell from 60 to 19, and the share of regular smokers dropped from 19 to five percent.
Smoking not Ã¢ÂÂrenormalisedÃ¢ÂÂ
Perceptions changed as well. Only 27 percent of young teens in 2015 said it was Ã¢ÂÂOK to try a cigaretteÃ¢ÂÂ, compared with 70 percent 15 years earlier.
Crucially, the rate at which these shifts took place barely slowed, if at all, from 2011 to 2015, the period when e-cigarettes were taking off.
Ã¢ÂÂFavourable perceptions of regular smoking among this age group also fell at a faster rate after the proliferation of e-cigarettes, which would not be expected if smoking was in the process of being Ã¢ÂÂrenormalisedÃ¢ÂÂ,Ã¢ÂÂ the authors concluded.
Figures from the rest of Europe and North America suggest similar trends.
The use of e-cigarettes in the United States jumped by more than 75 percent in 2018 compared with the year before, prompting the US Food and Drug Administration to call last fall tighter regulations.
Teens in every age bracket are today more likely to vape than to smoke cigarettes, according to the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).
Nearly 10 percent of 13-to-14 year olds said they had vaped within the last month, but less than four percent had lit up a cigarette, the NIDA reported in November.
For 17-to-18 year olds, the gap closed, but the number of smokers was still 50 percent lower than users of e-cigarettes.
In the United States today, one in 20 adults Ã¢ÂÂ or more than 10 million people Ã¢ÂÂ use e-cigarettes, while three times as many are smokers.
