Voting underway to elect Karachi deputy mayor,"
KARACHI: The polling began on Thursday morning to elect Karachi’s new deputy mayor.
The polling began at 9am and will continue till 5pm without any break. Deputy Commissioner (South) Syed Salahuddin has been named returning officer to supervise the election.
The office of deputy mayor fell vacant after the Election Commission of Pakistan declared Arshad Vohra as disqualified last month.

 The polling to the deputy mayor’s slot is being held at the City Council hall of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s old building.
The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) Syed Arshad Hussain and Pakistan People’s Party’s (PPP) Karamullah Waqasi are in the run for the slot.
The work will remain suspended at the KMC office on the polling day.

The decision came on a petition filed by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) seeking to de-seat Vohra for switching loyalty to the Mustafa Kamal-led party.
Vohra was elected as chairman of Union Council-49 of Karachi’s central district in the local council elections.
A five-member bench headed by ECP chief Justice (retd) Sardar Raza heard and decided the petition.
The then MQM-P convener Farooq Sattar had gone to the electoral body seeking disqualification of Vohra under the Local Government Act 2013.
He contended that Vohra elected as deputy mayor on MQM-P ticket and he did not relinquish his office after changing loyalty to PSP, which is sheer violation of the constitutional laws. He pleaded the ECP to issue a notification of Vohra’s disqualification.

Indians begin voting in second phase of mammoth general election,"
NEW DELHI: Voters across swaths of southern India began queueing up early on Thursday in the second phase of a mammoth, staggered general election in which opposition parties are trying to stop Prime Minister Narendra Modi from winning a second term.
More than 155 million people are eligible to vote in the second phase, which covers 95 parliament constituencies in 12 states including parts of restive Jammu and Kashmir. India’s parliament has 545 members.
The focus will be on the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, where the main opposition Congress party and its allies need to win big if they hope to oust Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

 “If the non-BJP parties perform well in these two states, then they would still be having a chance of forming a non-BJP government at the center,” said Sanjay Kumar, director of the Center for the Study of Developing Societies, a think tank based in the capital, New Delhi.
The election began last week and will end next month in a giant exercise involving almost 900 million people.
Votes will be counted on May 23 and the results are expected the same day.
The BJP began the election as the frontrunner, with Modi setting muscular national security as his campaign plank after a renewal of hostilities with neighboring Pakistan.

Can Cathedral Notre-Dame be restored in just five years?,"
French President Emmanuel Macron has promised to complete a painstaking renovation of Notre-Dame within five years after the historic cathedral suffered a monstrous fire that destroyed its spire and roof.
But will France be able to muster the necessary workers and materials to meet the challenge? While some experts say it’s possible, others are less sure, especially if officials want to stick as closely as possible to the original features of the 850-year-old gothic masterpiece.
What needs to be done?

 The cathedral’s floor is littered with charred debris that will require weeks, if not months, to clear.
Architects say that before any work can begin they must establish how solid the stone structure is since it might have been weakened by the fire’s extreme heat and water.
Culture Minister Franck Riester said Tuesday that two gables are at risk of falling, including one high above a row of apartment buildings just to the north of the church.
If it were to fall, “it could bring down the central gable that is between the two towers, the one you see when looking at Notre-Dame’s facade,” Riester said.
Once structural integrity is assured, workers can begin erecting a vast “umbrella” to keep rain from pouring into gaping holes, including one made by the spire’s collapse.
Renovation of the roof can then proceed – assuming officials have decided on aesthetic choices and materials.
“Five years isn’t much. Above all, it means three or four years of actual work, because first there’s the security phase of several months, and then six to seven months for diagnostics, if they deploy enough people,” said Frederic Letoffe, co-president of France’s GMH association of monument restoration firms.
Before Macron’s announcement, Letoffe had estimated the work would take 10 to 15 years.
But some things just can’t be rushed, for example the drying of concrete and sealants, “which can take months,” he said.
For architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte, the five-year goal is “tenable, but they’ll have to make the right technological choices.”
He advised replacing the old roof’s oak beams and lead sheeting with steel girders and titanium panels. “Those don’t burn,” he told France Inter radio.
Would an identical restoration take longer?
“Rebuilding exactly as it was is both humanly and technically possible,” said Francois Asselin, president of the CPME small and midsize business association and a specialist in restoring historic wooden roof frameworks.
Experts would nonetheless have an ace up their sleeve: US art professor Andrew Tallon took ultra-precise measurements of the cathedral’s interior and exterior in 2011 and 2012 that could be used to create a 3-D digital model.
Read More:Macron vows to rebuild Notre-Dame after devastating fire
“It’s quite possible to do it (in five years) using multinational companies that work extremely fast, the way they build a reinforced-concrete skyscraper,” said Benjamin Mouton, chief architect at Notre-Dame until 2013.
But that might mean abandoning the temptation to use traditional materials, even while replicating the aesthetics.
Purists might argue that a new “forest” of roof supports must be in oak, but modern materials could be lighter and stronger – and would be invisible to the millions of visitors to the cathedral each year.
“Five years is a very short timeframe for a wooden framework,” noted architect Christiane Schmuckle-Mollard, who helped restore the Strasbourg cathedral in eastern France.
Are there enough workers and materials?
“By September we’ll have to recruit 100 masons, 150 woodworkers and 200 roofers” to meet the five-year target, said Jean-Claude Bellanger, secretary general of France’s storied Compagnons du Devoir artisan mentoring network.
“Our sector suffers from a lack of youths and enthusiasm for these crafts,” agreed Letoffe. “But we have the capacity for mobilising the qualified talent.”
“And we have in France all the materials at our disposal, the wood, stone, zinc, copper and lead,” he added.
The Groupama insurance group, for example, has offered to provide the estimated 1,300 centenarian oaks required for an exact replica of the roofing framework, considered by many experts an architectural monument in its own right.
How much will it cost?
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said Wednesday that the price tag for such an ambitious project was not yet known.
But experts have given ballpark estimates in the hundreds of millions of euros — former culture minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon said anywhere from 600 million to one billion euros ($680 million to $1.1 billion).
Already some 850 million euros has been pledged, mainly from French billionaires and companies as well as the city of Paris and other authorities.
“The cost of the work isn’t the problem, it’s more about administrative delays,” said the GMH’s Letoffe. “The state needs to take measures to speed up the process.”
The government has named a former five-star general, Jean-Louis Georgelin, to oversee the race against the clock to wind up the work before France hosts the Olympic Games in 2024.

Peru’s former president kills himself to avoid arrest in corruption case,"
Peru’s former president Alan Garcia died in hospital on Wednesday after shooting himself in the head at his home as police were about to arrest him in a sprawling corruption case. He was 69.
The health ministry said Garcia died at 10:05 am (1505 GMT) of “a massive cerebral hemorrhage from a gunshot wound and cardiorespiratory arrest.”
Garcia was resuscitated three times after suffering heart attacks while undergoing emergency surgery, before finally succumbing, Peru’s Health Minister Zulema Tomas said.

 The Casimiro Ulloa Emergency Hospital in Lima earlier confirmed he had suffered “a bullet wound to his head.”
“This morning there was a regrettable accident: the president took the decision to shoot himself,” Erasmo Reyna, Garcia’s lawyer, told reporters outside the hospital after Garcia was admitted.
“Alan Garcia has died, long live APRA,” said Omar Quesada, the general secretary of Garcia’s American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA) party.
The attempted arrest unfolded at 6:30 am (1130 GMT) at Garcia’s home in Lima’s upmarket Miraflores neighbourhood.
Police were acting on an arrest warrant for money laundering that would have allowed Garcia to be held for 10 days, giving authorities time to gather evidence and prevent him from fleeing, the prosecutor’s office said.
Ricardo Pinedo, Garcia’s secretary, said the former president had four or five weapons in his home that were gifts from the armed forces. Police said he used one of those to shoot himself.
Interior Minister Carlos Moran said police “heard a gunshot a few minutes” after entering Garcia’s house before finding him “sitting down with a head wound.”
‘Condolences’
Peru’s President Martin Vizcarra expressed his sympathy on his Twitter account.
“Dismayed by the death of ex-president Alan Garcia. I send my condolences to his family and loved ones,” Vizcarra wrote in a tweet.
Chilean President Sebastian Pinera and Bolivia’s Evo Morales added their own condolences, while Colombian leader Ivan Duque said “with sadness we raise prayers” for Garcia’s family, adding: “Rest in peace.”
APRA congressman Mauricio Mulder said Garcia “took a dignified and honorable decision. An honourable act in the face of fascist persecution.”
Dozens of tearful supporters congregated at the hospital entrance when the news was announced.
Garcia, who was president from 1985-90 and again from 2006-11, was suspected of having taken bribes from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht in return for large-scale public works contracts.
In November, he sought refuge in the Uruguayan Embassy after a court ordered him not to leave the country for 18 months.
He applied for asylum but following 16 days in the embassy he left when his request was denied.
Garcia, a social democrat, claimed to be the target of political persecution, an accusation denied by centrist Vizcarra.
On Tuesday, Garcia had said he would neither try to flee nor hide again.
He had recently insisted that “there is no statement, evidence or deposit that links me to any crime and even less so with the Odebrecht company or the execution of any of its projects.”
Although under investigation by the public prosecutor’s office, Garcia had not been charged with anything. He had strongly protested his innocence and seemed prepared to cooperate with authorities.
Money laundering and bribes
He was one of four Peruvian ex-presidents embroiled in various corruption scandals – alongside Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (2016-18), Ollanta Humala (2011-16) and Alejandro Toledo (2001-06).
Kuczynski, who is accused of money laundering and was being held under a 10-day preliminary detention until April 20, was also taken to hospital on Wednesday suffering from high blood pressure.
The 80-year-old was being treated in intensive care and had a cardiac catheter fitted, lawmaker Gilbert Violeta said.
Toledo faces extradition from the United States, having been charged with taking a $20 million Odebrecht bribe.
Odebrecht has admitted paying $29 million in bribes to Peruvian officials over three administrations.
Some of those payments were allegedly made during Garcia’s second term in office to secure a contract to build the Lima metro.
Peruvian press reports also claim Garcia received a $100,000 payment from an illicit Odebrecht fund for giving a speech to Brazilian business leaders in Sao Paulo in May 2012.
Prosecutors allege that Garcia and 21 other officials conspired to enable Dutch company ATM Terminals to win a 2011 concession to operate a terminal at the port of Callao, near Lima.
Another ex-president, Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000), is serving a 25-year sentence for crimes against humanity and corruption.
His daughter, opposition leader Keiko Fujimori, is being held in pre-trial detention for up to three years, accused of accepting $1.2 million in illicit party funding from Odebrecht for her 2011 presidential campaign.

United States announces sanctions against Venezuela’s central bank,"
The United States on Wednesday announced sanctions against Venezuela’s central bank in its latest effort to strangle President Nicolas Maduro’s cash flow.
In a hard-hitting speech in Miami largely devoted to Cuba, National Security Advisor John Bolton also unveiled measures against a third leftist government in Latin America, Nicaragua, with sanctions against President Daniel Ortega’s son.
The United States said it would forbid all Americans’ dealings and block any US assets of the Central Bank of Venezuela as well as its director, Iliana Josefa Ruzza Teran, saying they were key conduits for funding Maduro’s government.

 “Treasury is designating the Central Bank of Venezuela to prevent it from being used as a tool of the illegitimate Maduro regime, which continues to plunder Venezuelan assets and exploit government institutions to enrich corrupt insiders,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement that accompanied Bolton’s speech.

The Treasury Department said it had taken precautions to ensure that ordinary Venezuelans can use debit and credit cards, even with the blacklisting of the central bank.
Bolton also announced action against Laureano Ortega Murillo, the son of Nicaragua’s leftist leader and Rosario Murillo, who is both vice president and first lady.
The Treasury Department accused the younger Ortega of “corrupt business deals” with foreign investors and of using the Nicaragua Grand Canal project – a long-running bid to build a rival to the Panama Canal – as a way to launder money.

Prince William to visit Christchurch in aftermath of mosques attacks,"
Britain’s Prince William will “bring comfort” to survivors of last month’s Christchurch massacre when he visits the city next week, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Wednesday.
The Duke of Cambridge will make a two-day trip starting on April 25 to the tragedy-scarred country, and is also set to meet first responders to the March 15 mosque attacks in which 50 people were killed.
“We welcome this visit by His Royal Highness and know it will bring comfort to those affected,” Ardern said in a statement.

“The Duke has a close connection with New Zealand and in particular Christchurch,” she added.
“His visit provides the opportunity to pay tribute to those affected by the mosque terrorist attacks and show support to the local and national community.”
The British royal visit will come six weeks after a self-avowed white supremacist killed 50 people in a shooting rampage at two mosques in Christchurch.
After arriving and attending engagements in Auckland, William will then head with Ardern to the South Island city, where the remainder of his programme will take place.
He will represent his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, the official head of state of the former British colony of New Zealand.
The Royals have previously expressed sympathy for the attacks, which stunned New Zealand’s small, tightly-knit Muslim community.

Trump hopes trade talks with China will be a success,"
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday held out hope the current trade talks with China will be a success and said an announcement on the status was due “shortly.”
The president’s remarks followed a report by The Wall Street Journal saying US and Chinese officials are tentatively working toward signing ceremony for a new trade agreement as soon as late May.
“I have a feeling we’ll be successful,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “That’s moving along quite well.”

 “You’ll be hearing about it very, very shortly.”
Citing an unnamed source, The Journal said US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer was expected to travel to Beijing for a new round of face-to-face talks the week of April 29.

The USTR office declined to comment on the report.
During shuttle diplomacy in recent months, US and Chinese officials have alternated between projecting optimism and warning that success in their high-stakes talks is not guaranteed.
But a key US demand – a binding enforcement mechanism to prevent Beijing from backsliding on its commitments – has been virtually agreed, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this month.
The two sides have exchanged tariffs on more than $360 billion in two-way trade since last year, weighing on both countries’ manufacturing sectors and unnerving global stock markets.
To help reduce Beijing’s soaring US trade surplus, Chinese officials have offered to increase purchases of American farm goods and energy exports.
But analysts say it remains unclear how far China will go in meeting US demands for fundamental changes in industrial policy that could weaken the communist party’s hold on power.

US North Korea envoy in Moscow as Russia plans for Kim-Putin talks,"
MOSCOW: The US special envoy for North Korea was due in Moscow on Wednesday as the Kremlin said it was preparing for possible talks between Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un. 
Media reports said the first summit between the two leaders could come as early as next week.
“Active preparations for a potential meeting are underway,” Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov said in comments reported by news agencies.

 The US State Department said Stephen Biegun would be in Moscow on Wednesday and Thursday “to meet with Russian officials to discuss efforts to advance the final, fully verified denuclearisation of North Korea.”
Russian, South Korean and Japanese media reported that Kim and Putin were set to meet in Russia’s Far East, though Ushakov would not be drawn on the location or date of a potential summit.
Quoting diplomatic sources, Russian newspaper Izvestia reported Wednesday that the meeting would take place in Vladivostok before the Russian leader heads to China for an April 26-27 summit.
One of the sources warned that the plans could change, however, noting that Kim was an “impulsive person”.
South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted diplomats in Seoul this week saying a meeting was being prepared.
On Wednesday, the agency reported that North Korea’s flagship carrier Air Koryo had scheduled a special flight to Vladivostok on Tuesday next week.
Japan’s Jiji Press, quoting a Russian diplomatic source, said it was “99 percent” certain that Putin and Kim will meet next Wednesday in Vladivostok.
Russia is keen to play a stronger role in international talks over North Korea’s nuclear programme, which have seen Kim meet US President Donald Trump for two summits over the last year.

Exploding bank’s ATMs with dynamite becomes new norm in Brazil,"
SAO PAULO: More than two dozen heavily-armed men stormed into the centre of Guararema early on a recent morning, rousing the Brazilian town’s residents with the sound of broken glass, explosions — and then gunshots.
Brandishing high-powered rifles, wearing bullet-proof vests, and carrying several kilos of dynamite, the gang pulled up in front of the town’s main police station. It then set upon an adjoining branch of Banco do Brasil, shattering its windows and doors with crowbars.
In a coordinated 3AM attack, police said, other gang members hit a Banco Santander Brasil branch two blocks away. They detonated the dynamite in an attempt to blow up ATM machines and vaults in both banks.

 Such attacks have become commonplace in Brazil: Last year, an average of two banks or ATM machines were robbed every day, mainly in small towns without a major police presence.
The spoils can be substantial.
Each ATM has four boxes storing up to 2,700 bills apiece, meaning one cash machine stuffed with 100-real bills can yield up to 1 million reais ($263,000). Bank robbers skilled with dynamite — working quickly— will often blow up several ATMs at each bank or go directly for their vaults.
To combat the robberies, Brazil’s banks have invested in anti-theft technology, ranging from specialized ATMs to facial recognition cameras. When that fails or the costs become prohibitive, they have simply closed branches; as a result, some towns no longer have easy access to financial services in a country that already has a higher proportion of “unbanked” residents than either China or India.
The rash of bank robberies reflects just one way in which widespread violence is taking a toll on Latin America’s largest economy, pushing frustrated Brazilians to elect President Jair Bolsonaro in October on a promise to crack down on crime.
“Crime seeks opportunities,” said Rafael Alcadipani da Silveira, a public security expert at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a think tank in Sao Paulo. “In Brazil, organized crime is very strong, security in small towns is weak and bank raids seem like an easy crime to commit.”
In the Guararema bank robbery, police pursued the gang to a nearby highway, where the two sides exchanged gunfire. Eleven gang members were killed by police.

Malaysia begins inquiry into 2015 discovery of mass graves,"
KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia began a public inquiry on Wednesday into the discovery of mass graves and suspected human trafficking camps in the jungles near its border with Thailand, which prompted a regional crisis in 2015, and accusations over obstruction of justice.
The dense jungles of southern Thailand and northern Malaysia have been a major stop-off point for smugglers bringing people to Southeast Asia by boat from Myanmar, most of them Rohingya Muslims who say they are fleeing persecution, and Bangladesh.
In January, the government had said it would set up a panel to inquire into claims that authorities mishandled an investigation into 139 mass graves and more than 12 campsites suspected to have been run by migrant-smuggling gangs.

 Three police from a jungle infantry unit described finding the first of the campsites in January 2015, during a patrol in a heavily-forested region on the Malaysian side of the border.
The officials found an area filled with tents and structures made of wooden sticks, some as high as two storeys, said one of them, Mat Ten.
“These makeshift houses were surrounded by barbed wire and there were people living inside,” he told the panel.
The men’s testimony confirmed media reports and rights groups’ statements that authorities had known about the camps four months before going public in May 2015.
In a report last month, the Malaysian Human Rights Commission and rights group Fortify Rights said authorities had destroyed one of the camps a day after its discovery, wiping out evidence that could have aided police investigations.
The human rights commission was set up by Malaysia’s parliament but the government is not bound by its findings.
Mat Ten said he returned with a team of ten police to survey the site the day after the first visit, but they were interrupted after a woman they believed to be acting as a lookout alerted others at the camp, forcing the team to flee.
Six Rohingya and Bangladeshi migrants who were left behind were detained and handed over to immigration authorities, said Mohamad Mossadique Azni, the officer who led the raiding team.
The discovery of similar camps and graves on the Thai side of the border triggered a regional crisis in 2015.
A Thai crackdown on the camps prompted traffickers to abandon thousands of migrants in overloaded boats in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea.
The hearings continue on Thursday.

Sidhu urges Indian Muslims to vote to defeat PM Modi,"
Indian cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu has urged Muslim voters of a Lok Sabha constituency in Bihar to vote together and defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Radio Pakistan reported that the former cricketer was canvassing in support of veteran Congress leader and former union minister Tariq Anwar at a rally in Katihar.
﻿
Sidhu stressed Muslims to recognize their strength and not to consider themselves a minority as they are about 64 percent in the constituency.

 The Indian politician has been quite critical of Modi’s warmongering policies.In the wake of recent tensions between Pakistan and India, Sidhu asked his nation to beware of the leaders who banged the drums of war in order to whip the citizenry into patriotic fervor, for patriotism was indeed a double-edged sword.
Without taking the name of Modi, Sindhu pointed out, in his tweet of March 2, that he deliberately fueled tension and war-mongering to take electoral benefit in the upcoming elections in India.
India is currently holding general elections phase-wise.
