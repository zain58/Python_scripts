New Zealand disarms police as terror threat level lowered,"
WELLINGTON (AFP) - New Zealand police on Wednesday ended the routine arming of frontline officers as the terrorism threat level was lowered a month after the Christchurch mosques massacre.
Police and security agencies reduced the threat level from high to medium, meaning authorities judge that another attack, violent criminal behaviour, or violent protest remains ""feasible"" rather than ""very likely"".
The level is still higher than it was before the March 15 attacks, when the threat was deemed to be ""low"".
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said ""there is no current specific threat"", but the security agencies believed the medium level ""accurately reflects our current status"".
Frontline New Zealand police have historically not carried firearms and many people were shocked to see them heavily armed after 50 Muslims were gunned down while at Friday prayers.
Police commissioner Mike Bush said with the easing of the security threat level, the police had reassessed their position on arming frontline staff and the carrying of weapons would now be decided on a case-by-case basis.
The decision was made after ""significant consultation"" with mosques and Islamic Centres in relation to ongoing security, although Bush said he would not release details.
""There was never any intention for the routine carriage of firearms to continue indefinitely,"" Bush said.
""Generally this means frontline staff will transition back to our normal approach regarding carriage and access to firearms.
The police also released a timeline of the mosque attacks, showing it took 18 minutes from the time of the first emergency call to the apprehension of the alleged shooter.

Valley of the dolls: scarecrows outnumber people in Japan village,"
NAGORO (AFP) - In the tiny village of Nagoro, deep in the mountains of western Japan, the wind howls down a deserted street with not a living soul to be seen.
But yet the street appears busy, dotted with life-sized dolls that outnumber humans 10 to one, the product of a one-woman bid to counter the emptiness and loneliness felt in Nagoro, like many Japanese villages decimated by depopulation.
Nagoro, around 550 kilometres (400 miles) southwest of Tokyo, has become known as the valley of dolls after local resident Tsukimi Ayano began placing scarecrows on the street to inject some life into her depopulated village.
""Only 27 people live in this village but the number of scarecrows is tenfold, like 270,"" the 69-year-old doll maker told AFP in an interview at her home.
It all started 16 years ago when the dexterous Ayano created a scarecrow dressed in her father’s clothes to prevent birds eating the seeds she had planted in her garden.
""A worker who saw it in the garden thought it really was my father... he said hello but it was a scarecrow. It was funny,"" recalled Ayano.
Since then, Ayano has not stopped creating the life-size dolls, made with wooden sticks, newspapers to fill the body, elastic fabrics for skin and knitting wool for hair.
The skillful craftswoman needs only three days to make an adult-sized doll that are now scattered all around the village.
The secret to breathing life into the dolls? Applying pink colour to the lips and cheeks with a make-up brush, revealed Ayano.
At the local school, she has placed 12 colourful child-sized dolls at desks, positioned as if part of a lively class poring over their books.
The school closed seven years ago as there was no one left to teach, she recalled sadly.
""Now there are no children. The youngest person here is 55 years old.""
Down the street, a ""family"" of scarecrows lounges in front of an abandoned grocery shop while a doll dressed as an old farmer window-shops next door.
Near the bus stop, a group of scarecrows gathers as another ""father"" doll pulls a cart full of ""children.""

‘It’s lonely now’ 


While never humming with people, Ayano remembers as a child that Nagoro was once a well-to-do place with some 300 residents and labourers supported by the forestry industry and dam construction work.
""People gradually left... It’s lonely now,"" she said. ""I made more dolls as I remembered the time when the village was lively.""
Nagoro’s plight is replicated all around Japan, as the world’s third-largest economy battles a declining population, low birth rate and high life expectancy.
The country is on the verge of becoming the first ""ultra-aged"" country in the world, meaning that 28 percent of people are aged 65 or above.
The latest government report shows that 27.7 percent of a population of 127 million -- one in four people -- are aged 65 or older and the figure is expected to jump to 37.7 percent in 2050.
According to experts, around 40 percent of Japan’s 1,700 municipalities are defined as ""depopulated.""

‘Extremely difficult’ 


After World War II, when forestry and agriculture were the main economic drivers, many Japanese lived in rural villages like Nagoro. But young people started to leave for Tokyo in the 1960s, said Takumi Fujinami, economist at the Japan Research Institute.
""The economy was booming in Tokyo and industrial areas at that time. They were the only places people could earn money, so a lot of young people moved there,"" he said.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged to revive regions outside Tokyo by pumping in tens of billions of yen, but this is not enough to stop young people from leaving their hometowns to work in Tokyo, Fujinami said.
""In order to combat depopulation, we need people moving in to depopulated areas. But recovering the population is extremely difficult,"" he said.
""Instead, it’s important to increase income or improve working conditions for young people in rural areas.""
For example, companies in rural areas tend to have fewer holidays than those in Tokyo, he said.
""We need to create communities where young people can make a long-term living ,"" Fujinami said, adding that subsidising them to move in is not enough.
While there is little evidence of citizens returning to Nagoro, Ayano’s dolls have attracted flesh-and-blood people from as far afield as the US and France.
""Before I started making scarecrows, nobody stopped by. Now many people visit here,"" she said.
""I hope Nagoro will become lively again and many people come here for sightseeing.""
""I don’t know what Nagoro will look like in 10 or 20 years... but I’ll keep on making dolls."" ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-17-19/news_big_images/487358_19452946.jpg,world,"They were the only places people could earn money, so a lot of young people moved there,"" he said.",neutral
Trump vetoes bill to end US support for Saudi-led Yemen war,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday vetoed a resolution from Congress directing him to end US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, the second such move of his presidency.
The resolution was a harsh bipartisan rebuke to Trump that took the historic step of curtailing a president s war-making powers -- a step he condemned in a statement announcing his veto.
""This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,"" Trump said.
The veto was the second of his presidency, after he overrode a congressional resolution that aimed to reverse the border emergency he declared in order to secure more funding for his wall between the United States and Mexico in March.
Vetoing the measure is an ""effective green light for the war strategy that has created the world s worst humanitarian crisis to continue,"" said International Rescue Committee president and CEO David Miliband.
""Yemen is at a breaking point with 10 million people on the brink of famine. There are as many as 100 civilian casualties per week, and Yemenis are more likely to be killed at home than in any other structure.""
Trump argued that US support for the bloody war between the Saudi-backed Yemeni government and Iran-aligned Huthi rebels was necessary for a variety of reasons, ""first and foremost"" to ""protect the safety of the more than 80,000 Americans who reside in certain coalition countries.""
These countries ""have been subject to Huthi attacks from Yemen,"" he said, referring to drone and missile strikes the Saudi-led coalition has either claimed were intercepted or denied altogether.
The president also said the resolution would ""harm the foreign policy of the United States"" and ""harm our bilateral relationships.""
And it would ""negatively affect our ongoing efforts to prevent civilian casualties and prevent the spread of terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS, and embolden Iran s malign activities in Yemen,"" Trump said, referring to two Sunni Muslim militant groups and his Shiite bete noire.
The resolution, which passed the US House of Representatives earlier this month and the Senate in March, was a historic milestone, as it was the first time in history that a measure invoking the 1973 War Powers Resolution reached the president s desk.
Democrats argued that US involvement in the Yemen conflict -- through intelligence-sharing, logistical support and now-discontinued aerial refueling -- is unconstitutional without congressional authority.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi -- the country s most senior Democratic politician -- took aim at Trump s veto in a series of tweets on Tuesday.
""The conflict in Yemen is a horrific humanitarian crisis that challenges the conscience of the entire world,"" Pelosi wrote. ""Yet the President has cynically chosen to contravene a bipartisan, bicameral vote of the Congress & perpetuate America s shameful involvement in this heartbreaking crisis.""
Senator Bernie Sanders, a lead author of the Yemen resolution and a Democratic 2020 presidential candidate, said that ""the people of Yemen desperately need humanitarian help, not more bombs.""
""I am disappointed, but not surprised, that Trump has rejected the bi-partisan resolution to end U.S. involvement in the horrific war in Yemen,"" Sanders tweeted.
Critics of the intervention warn that Saudi forces are likely using US weapons to commit atrocities in the four-year war.
Some 10,000 people have been killed in Yemen over the past four years, according to the World Health Organization, although rights groups say the toll could be five times higher.
Both the Saudi-led alliance and Huthi rebels have been accused of acts that could amount to war crimes, while the coalition has been blacklisted by the United Nations for killing and maiming children.

UN in negotiations on Libya ceasefire,"
UNITED NATIONS (AFP) - United Nations Security Council diplomats began negotiations Tuesday on a British-drafted resolution that would demand an immediate ceasefire in Libya after forces loyal to commander Khalifa Haftar launched an offensive on Tripoli.
The proposed text seen by AFP warns that the offensive by Haftar s Libyan National Army (LNA) ""threatens the stability of Libya and prospects for a United Nations-facilitated political dialogue and a comprehensive political solution to the crisis.""
The council ""demands that all parties in Libya immediately de-escalate the situation, commit to a ceasefire, and engage with the United Nations to ensure a full and comprehensive cessation of hostilities throughout Libya,"" the draft says.
After Britain circulated the text late Monday, a first round of negotiations was held during which Russia raised objections to references criticizing Haftar, diplomats said.
""They were very clear. No reference anywhere,"" a council diplomat said.
Britain was hoping to bring the measure to a vote at the council before Friday, but diplomats pointed to Russia s objections as a hurdle.
At least 174 people have been killed and more than 18,000 displaced since Haftar ordered his forces to march on Tripoli on April 4, according to UN figures. A rocket attack on the city killed two people and injured four on Tuesday.
Last week, Russia blocked a draft council statement that would have called on Haftar s forces to halt their advance on Tripoli.
The proposed measure echoed a call for a ceasefire by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who was in Libya to personally advance prospects for a political solution when the offensive was launched.
Haftar, seen by his allies Egypt and the United Arab Emirates as a bulwark against Islamists, has declared he wants to seize the capital, now controlled by a UN-recognized government and an array of militias.
Haftar backs a rival administration based in eastern Libya that is refusing to recognize the authority of the Tripoli government.
The draft resolution calls on all sides in Libya ""immediately to re-commit"" to UN peace efforts and urges all member-states ""to use their influence over the parties"" to see that the resolution is respected.
Resolutions adopted by the council are legally binding.
Diplomats have long complained that foreign powers backing rival sides in Libya threatened to turn the conflict into a proxy war.
Saudi Arabia is also seen as a key Haftar supporter, while Qatar -- which has tense ties with Riyadh and Abu Dhabi -- has called for stronger enforcement of the UN arms embargo to keep weapons out of Haftar s hands.
Russia and France, two permanent council members, have praised Haftar s battlefield successes in defeating Libyan armed groups aligned with the Islamic State in the south of the country.
Haftar s offensive on the capital forced the United Nations to postpone a national conference that was to draw up a roadmap to elections, meant to turn the page on years of chaos since the 2011 ouster of Moamer Kadhafi.
Guterres has said that serious negotiations on Libya s future cannot resume without a ceasefire.

Muslim-majority Indonesia votes in its biggest-ever election,"
JAKARTA (AFP) - Indonesia kicked off one of the world s biggest one-day elections Wednesday, pitting president Joko Widodo against ex-general Prabowo Subianto in a race to lead the Muslim-majority nation.
More than 190 million Indonesians are set to cast a ballot as polls opened shortly after 7:00 am local time (2200 GMT Tuesday) in restive Papua. The vote is slated to end at 1:00 pm (0600 GMT) in Sumatra at the other end of the volcano-dotted archipelago.
Some voters went to their local mosque before casting ballots, as the daily call to prayer sounded across a nation that is nearly 90 percent Muslim.
A record 245,000 candidates are running for public office, from the presidency and parliamentary seats to local positions -- the first time all are being held on the same day.
Opinion polls show Widodo, 57, is a clear favourite -- but he faces a tough challenge from Subianto, 67, who has leaned on a fiery nationalist ticket and warned he will challenge the results over voter-list irregularities if he loses.
Subianto narrowly lost to Widodo in 2014 elections, and unsuccessfully challenged those results.
Voters will flock to more than 800,000 polling stations where they ll punch holes in ballots -- to make clear their candidate choice -- and then dip a finger in Muslim-approved halal ink, a measure to prevent double-voting in a graft-riddled country where ballot-buying is rife.
The polls present a huge logistical challenge in a country stretching 4,800 kilometres across more than 17,000 islands with a population of more than 260 million, including hundreds of ethnic groups and languages.
Officials were moving cardboard ballot boxes by motorbikes, boats and planes -- as well as elephants and horses -- to reach mountaintop villages and communities deep in the jungle.
A series of so-called ""quick counts"" are expected to give a reliable indication of the presidential winner later Wednesday. Official results are not expected until May.
The poll has been punctuated by bitter mudslinging and a slew of fake news online that threatens to sway millions of undecided voters.
Widodo has campaigned on his ambitious drive to build much-needed roads, airports and other infrastructure across Southeast Asia s largest economy.
But his rights record has been criticised owing to an uptick in discriminatory attacks on religious and other minorities, including a small LGBT community, as Islamic hardliners become more vocal in public life.
His choice of conservative cleric Ma ruf Amin as his running mate has also raised fears about the future of Indonesia s reputation for moderate Islam.
Raised in a bamboo shack in a riverside slum, the soft-spoken Widodo stands in stark contrast to Subianto, whose strongman image is underscored by a penchant for slamming lecterns as he accuses Jakarta of selling the country off to foreign interests.
Subianto -- joined by running mate Sandiaga Uno, a 49-year-old wealthy financier -- has courted Islamic hardliners, promised a boost to military and defence spending and, taking a page from US President Donald Trump, vowed to put ""Indonesia first"" by reviewing billions of dollars in Chinese investment.
Subianto s long-held presidential ambitions have been dogged by strong ties to the Suharto dictatorship, which collapsed two decades ago, and a chequered past.
He ordered the abduction of democracy activists as the authoritarian regime collapsed in 1998, and was accused of committing atrocities in East Timor.

Saudi king hosts Abu Dhabi crown prince amid Sudan turmoil,"
RIYADH (AFP) - Saudi Arabia s King Salman on Tuesday hosted Abu Dhabi s crown prince for talks, state media said, after the Gulf allies threw their support behind Sudan s military rulers who ousted veteran leader Omar al-Bashir.
Abu Dhabi s Prince Mohammed bin Zayed discussed ""regional developments"" with the king and his powerful son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the official Saudi Press Agency said in a brief report.
After weeks of silence on Sudan s political turmoil, Saudi Arabia and the UAE on Sunday released a brief reaction to Bashir s toppling following months of street protests, calling for ""stability"" and a ""peaceful transition"".
Saudi Arabia and the UAE both voiced backing for Sudan s Transitional Military Council, with Riyadh promising an aid package to Sudanese people.
Sudan plays a key role in the regional interests of Saudi Arabia and its allies, siding with Riyadh against Shiite Iran and providing troops in the Saudi-led coalition fighting in the Yemen war.
A senior Sudanese military official on Monday said troops from his country will remain in Yemen until the Arab alliance achieves its goals.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE intervened in the Yemen war in 2015 to fight Iran-aligned Huthi rebels.
The Gulf powerhouses are also following events in Libya, where forces loyal to warlord Khalifa Haftar launched an offensive on Tripoli, now controlled by a UN-recognised government and an array of militias.
Haftar s close ties to Saudi Arabia and the UAE are critical to his campaign, observers say.
Saudi Arabia is said to have recently pledged tens of millions of dollars to the warlord s forces, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Egypt parliament votes to extend Sisi rule,"
CAIRO (AFP) - Egypt s parliament on Tuesday approved constitutional amendments allowing general-turned-president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to stay in power until 2030, state media reported.
Deputies also backed other sweeping changes to the constitution including to give the military greater influence in political life as well as granting Sisi more control over the judiciary.
The amendments are expected to be put to a public referendum later this month.
""The president s current term shall expire at the end of six years from the date of his election as president in 2018,"" reported the official Al-Ahram news website and broadcaster Nile TV.
""He can be re-elected for another (six-year) term.""
Sisi led the army s overthrow of elected president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 following mass protests against the Islamist leader s rule.
He won his first term as president in 2014 and was re-elected in March 2018 with more than 97 percent of the vote, after standing virtually unopposed.
His government has been widely criticised by human rights groups for the repression of political opponents.
But Mohamed Abu Hamed, a member of parliament who pushed for the constitutional amendments to keep Sisi in power, was adamant the changes were needed to allow him to complete political and economic reforms.
""The constitution in 2014 was written under tough exceptional circumstances,"" he told AFP.
The deputy hailed Sisi as a president who ""took important political, economic and security measures... (and) must continue with his reforms,"" in the face of the unrest gripping neighbouring countries.
The vote comes after two veteran presidents were ousted in Algeria and Sudan and amid an escalation of the conflict in Libya.
Keeping Sisi in power, he added, reflected ""the will of the people"".
State-run Al-Ahram news website said several MPs carried Egyptian flags as they gathered for the vote inside the parliament while nationalistic songs played in the background.
The amendments were initially introduced in February by a parliamentary bloc supportive of Sisi and updated this week after several rounds of debates.
Prior to the amendments, Egypt s 2014 constitution stipulated only two four-year presidential terms.
The 596-seat parliament, which is dominated by Sisi loyalists, was elected in 2015, about a year after Sisi took office.
Since Sisi overthrew Morsi, Egypt has drawn heavy international criticism for its sweeping crackdown on dissent.
The authorities have jailed thousands of Morsi s supporters as well as liberal and secular activists, including a popular blogger, actors, singers and journalists.
As lawmakers debated the proposed changes, prominent dissident actors Khaled Abol Naga and Amr Waked denounced them as a power grab.
If passed, ""these amendments would take us back to a dictatorship fit for the Middle Ages,"" Waked told a news conference by rights groups in Geneva.
His fellow actor criticised Sisi s narrative that his rule brought stability.
""Where is there stability in a country that jails children... that treats people badly or that kills?"" he said.
Human Rights Watch has said the amendments would ""institutionalise authoritarianism"".
When Sisi visited Washington for talks with US President Donald Trump last week, HRW urged Congress to withhold endorsement of his bid to extend his rule.
""Congress needs to use its levers to pressure the Egyptian president to reverse course, starting with withdrawing these constitutional amendments set to consolidate authoritarian rule,"" said HRW s Michael Page.
Amnesty International has warned the constitutional amendments ""would worsen the devastating human rights crisis Egyptians are already facing"".
""They would grant President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and security forces free rein to further abuse their powers and suppress peaceful dissent for years to come,"" said Amnesty s Magdalena Mughrabi.
Other constitutional amendments include a quota for women s representation of no less than 25 percent in parliament and forming a second parliamentary chamber.

Macron vows to rebuild a 'more beautiful' Notre-Dame in 5 years,"
PARIS (AFP) - President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday vowed to rebuild Notre-Dame cathedral ""even more beautifully"" within five years, as France reeled with shock from the fire that gutted the great Paris landmark.
Macron announced the fast timescale -- for a process some experts said would take decades -- in an address to the nation where he hailed how the disaster had shown the capacity of France to mobilise and unite.
Pledges worth around 700 million euros ($790 million) have already been made Tuesday from French billionaires and businesses to restore the Gothic masterpiece.
Most of the roof has been destroyed, its steeple has collapsed and an unknown number of artifacts and paintings have been lost. The main organ, which had close to 8,000 pipes, has also suffered damage.
But the cathedral s walls, bell towers and the most famous circular stained-glass windows at France s most visited tourist attraction remain intact.
Macron s defiant comments indicated he wants the reconstruction of the cathedral to be completed by the time Paris hosts the Olympic Games in 2024.
""We will rebuild the cathedral even more beautifully and I want it to be finished within five years,"" Macron said from the Elysee Palace. ""And we can do it.""
Macron said that the dramatic fire had brought out the best in a country riven with divisions and since November shaken by sometimes violent protests against his rule.
""What we saw last night in Paris was our capacity to mobilise and to unite,"" Macron said, hailing France as a nation of ""builders"".
""Our history never stops and that we will always have trials to overcome,"" he said.
Images from inside the cathedral Tuesday showed its immense walls standing proud, with statues still in place and a gleaming golden cross above the altar.
However the floor was covered in charred rubble from the fallen roof and water while parts of the vaulting at the top of the cathedral had collapsed.
Junior interior minister Laurent Nunez told reporters at the scene that work to secure the structure would continue into Thursday, allowing firefighters access to remove remaining artifacts and artworks.
He said the building had been saved within a critical time window of 15-30 minutes by a team of 400 firefighters who worked flat out throughout the night.
Though ""some weaknesses"" in the 850-year-old structure had been identified, overall it is ""holding up OK"", he added.
President Donald Trump relayed Americans  ""condolences"" to Macron over the fire, the White House said.
French fire chiefs had earlier dismissed as ""risible"" comments by Trump that the fire should be tackled with water bombers, saying this risked destroying the entire edifice of the cathedral.
The Paris fire service said that the last remnants of the blaze were extinguished Tuesday, 15 hours after the fire broke out.
Renovation work on the steeple, where workers were replacing its lead covering, is widely suspected to have caused the inferno after the blaze broke out in an area under scaffolding.
Investigators interviewed witnesses overnight and began speaking with employees of five different construction companies that were working on the monument, said public prosecutor Remy Heitz.
""Nothing indicates this was a deliberate act,"" Heitz told reporters, adding that 50 investigators had been assigned to what he expected to be a ""long and complex"" case.
A public appeal for funds drew immediate support from French billionaires and other private donors as well as from countries including Germany, Italy and Russia which offered expertise.
French billionaire Bernard Arnault and his LVMH luxury conglomerate, rival high-end designer goods group Kering, Total oil company and cosmetics giant L Oreal each pledged 100 million euros or more.
Support came from outside France as well, with Apple chief Tim Cook announcing the tech giant would give an unspecified amount to help restore a ""precious heritage for future generations.""
But experts had warned a full restoration will take many years. ""I d say decades,"" said Eric Fischer, head of the foundation in charge of restoring the 1,000-year-old Strasbourg cathedral.
Thousands of Parisians and tourists watched in horror Monday as flames engulfed the building and rescuers tried to save as much as they could of the cathedral s treasures.
Many more came Tuesday to the banks of the river Seine to gaze at where the roof and steeple once stood.
A firefighter suffered injuries during the blaze, which at one point threatened to bring down one of the two monumental towers on the western facade of the cathedral that is visited by 13 million tourists each year.
The Holy Crown of Thorns, believed to have been worn by Jesus at his crucifixion, was saved by firefighters, as was a sacred tunic worn by 13th-century French king Louis IX.
Rescuers formed a human chain at the site of the disaster to evacuate as many artifacts as possible, which were then stocked temporarily at the Paris town hall.

Erdogan's AK Party calls for rerun of Istanbul elections,"
ISTANBUL/ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan s AK Party formally requested on Tuesday an annulment and rerun of Istanbul s municipal elections over what it said were irregularities, prompting the main opposition to accuse it of damaging democracy.
Initial results from the March 31 vote showed the main opposition Republican People s Party (CHP) narrowly won control of Turkey s largest city, thereby ending 25 years of control of a key power centre by the AKP and its Islamist predecessors.
The loss of Istanbul, Turkey s financial hub, would be a blow to Erdogan, who campaigned hard ahead of the vote. The post-vote uncertainty has kept financial markets on edge and contributed to a nearly 5 percent slide in the lira.
In the 16 days since the election, the AKP has filed numerous appeals for vote recounts across Istanbul, a city of more than 15 million people. The High Election Board (YSK) has approved some of those objections, ordering partial or full recounts in several districts. Some are still underway.
Submitting his party s appeal for the annulment and renewal of the vote to the YSK on Tuesday, AKP Deputy Chairman Ali Ihsan Yavuz said thousands of votes had been impacted by the irregularities.
""There is clearly an organised unlawfulness, an election fraud here. The only authority that can end this controversy is the YSK,"" Yavuz told reporters in the capital Ankara.
The AKP has already lost control of Ankara and other key cities. Defeat in Istanbul, where Erdogan was mayor in the 1990s, would be an even greater setback to the president.
The AKP urged electoral officials to block the YSK from giving CHP candidate Ekrem Imamoglu his mayoral mandate after the Istanbul recounts are completed and a final result emerges.
CHP spokesman Faik Oztrak branded the AKP appeal for renewed elections as a ""plot"" and called on the YSK to mandate Imamoglu as the elected mayor of the city.
""The authority that will put a stop to this exploitation, who will hand the right the people gave to the person who earned it is the High Election Board,"" Oztrak told reporters.
""If there is security and predictability of the law in this country, then the YSK s decision should already be clear.""
 

SUITCASES OF DOCUMENTS

The AKP s Yavuz said 16,884 votes were marked as either invalid or added to the tallies of other parties in the elections. He said the AKP had submitted three suitcases of documents to the YSK to prove the irregularities.
If the appeal is approved, a second election would take place on June 2. If rejected, the results would be finalised and the CHP s Ekrem Imamoglu would receive his mandate as mayor.
Yavuz said the gap between Imamoglu and his AKP rival, former Turkish prime minister Binali Yildirim, had fallen to 13,900 votes from around 28,000 as a result of the recounts.
If all votes had been recounted across the city the AKP would have won, Yavuz added.
The repeated AKP challenges have fuelled frustration among CHP supporters, which spilled over into football stadiums at the weekend when fans chanted at top Istanbul derby matches for the mayoral mandate to be given to their candidate.
Speaking on Tuesday to supporters chanting ""give Imamoglu the mandate"" in Istanbul, Imamoglu said the AKP actions harmed the credibility of Turkey s democracy.
""To those who said they carried what they call evidence in suitcases, I say: I think you are experiencing an eclipse of reasoning. Stop this, don t harm this nation, these people,"" he said.

East Libyan forces' push for Tripoli stirs foreign divisions,"
TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Qatar called on Tuesday for a blocking of foreign arms supplies to eastern Libyan forces commander Khalifa Haftar, whose push to seize the capital Tripoli is causing rifts around the Gulf and Europe.
Nearly two weeks into its assault, the veteran general s eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) is stuck in the city s southern outskirts battling armed groups loyal to the internationally-recognised Tripoli government.
Yet Tripoli s roughly 2.5 million people were maintaining a semblance of normality - even as the occasional artillery boom echoed across the city.
""We are still carrying on, thank God. What else can we do?"" said Mohamed Taha, 23, in a street where students still packed a nearby school. Cafes and shops also remained open and busy.
Foreign powers are worried but unable to present a united front over the latest flare-up in the cycle of anarchy and warfare that has gripped Libya since dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011.
The conflict has brought a growing humanitarian toll - 174 people, 756 injured and 18,250 displaced according to latest United Nations tallies - and sunk for now an international peace plan.
It threatens to disrupt oil flows, foment migration across the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, and allow jihadists to exploit the chaos.
Qatar said an existing U.N. arms embargo on Libya should be strictly enforced, to prevent Haftar, 75, from receiving arms.
The Benghazi-based Haftar enjoys the backing of Egypt, the United Arab Einmirates and Saudi Arabia, who view him as an anchor to restore stability and combat Islamist militants. Those three nations cut ties with Qatar in 2017, accusing it of support for militants and Iran.
Qatar s Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told Italian daily La Repubblica that a postponed U.N. peace conference should be rescheduled and Haftar s troops forced to withdraw.
The arms embargo must be implemented ""to prevent those countries that have been providing ammunitions and state-of-the-art weapons from continuing to do so,"" he said.
Past U.N. reports say the UAE and Egypt have both supplied Haftar with arms and aircraft, giving him air superiority among Libya s multiple factions. East Libyan authorities say Qatar and Turkey back rival, Islamist-leaning factions in western Libya.
 

UN MAY DEMAND CEASEFIRE

The Gulf diplomatic divisions echo those in Europe, where former colonial ruler Italy and France have sparred over Libya.
Paris has given Haftar support in the past, viewing him as the best bet to end the chaos since a NATO-backed rebellion to end Gaddafi s murderous four-decade rule.
Italy, with considerable oil interests in the OPEC member, supports the Tripoli government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj and was furious with French reluctance to back a recent European Union resolution urging Haftar to halt his advance.
Nevertheless, Serraj has managed to keep the LNA at bay, thanks largely to armed groups who have rushed to aid them from other western Libyan factions.
The U.N. Security Council is considering a British-drafted resolution that would demand a ceasefire and urge all nations with influence over the warring parties to ensure compliance.
The 15-member council has expressed concern but been unable so far to issue a more formal statement, diplomats said, as Russia objected to a reference to the LNA while Washington said it could not agree a text that did not mention Haftar s forces.
Though Haftar presents himself as a champion against what he calls terrorism, opponents cast him as a would-be dictator in the mould of Gaddafi. About 70 people protested against him at the central Algiers Square in Tripoli on Tuesday.
""We are against Haftar and military rule,"" said demonstrator Assam Dirbiq.
Haftar was among officers who helped Gaddafi rise to power in 1969, but fell out with him during a war with Chad in the 1980s. He was taken prisoner by the Chadians, rescued by the CIA, and lived for about 20 years in Virginia before returning in 2011 to join other rebels in the uprising against Gaddafi.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-16-19/news_big_images/487314_45231675.jpg,world,"Nevertheless, Serraj has managed to keep the LNA at bay, thanks largely to armed groups who have rushed to aid them from other western Libyan factions.",neutral
Hundreds of Afghan delegates to meet with Taliban in Doha,"
(AFP) – Afghanistan published Tuesday a lengthy list of delegates who will meet with the Taliban in Doha this week, including government officials, in what could become the highest-level dialogue between the sworn enemies in years.
A massive roster published by the presidential palace comprises 250 names, including President Ashraf Ghani s chief of staff, Abdul Salam Rahimi, as well as his election running mate, Amrullah Saleh, the former head of Afghan intelligence.
Other delegates named on the list come from many walks of Afghan life including youth leaders, tribal elders and -- significantly -- 52 women.
The last time the Taliban met with the Afghan government was at secretive talks in Pakistan in 2015, which were quickly derailed by the news that Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar had died.
The three days of talks in Qatar, scheduled to start Friday, come amid a months-long push led by Washington for peace nearly 18 years after the US invasion, and as fresh violence rips across Afghanistan.
Any contact between the Kabul government and the Taliban is seen as hugely significant, because the insurgents view Ghani as a US stooge and his government as a puppet regime, and have long refused to speak with them directly.
They have insisted that any government officials attending this week s talks will be doing so only in a ""personal capacity"".
The US, which has cited significant progress after holding direct talks with the militants in Doha several times since September, is not expected to attend.
The militants have not announced a final list of who is headed to Doha, and distanced themselves from a report that suggested their delegation might also include women.
The peace process thus far has been widely criticised for a lack of female representation, and US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has pushed for greater inclusivity.
While the Taliban previously met with Afghan representatives and politicians in Moscow in February, those talks did not include members of Ghani s government.
The spokesman for former president Hamid Karzai, who was at the Moscow talks, said Karzai supported the ""intra-Afghan"" conference in Doha but would not be attending.
Kabul has also been left out of the talks with the Khalilzad and the US delegation, prompting concerns the Afghan government is being sidelined in its own peace process and underscoring the importance of this week s meetings in Doha.
This month, the United Nations said it had lifted travel bans for 11 Taliban delegates so they could attend talks.
That list includes Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a co-founder of the Islamist movement and its top political leader, as well as Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, the Taliban s chief negotiator and former deputy minister of foreign affairs.
The Taliban last week announced the start of Operation Fath, this year s spring offensive, and violence has continued apace across Afghanistan despite Khalilzad calling for a ceasefire.

Cheap tactics: BJP virals Abhinandan's fake picture during election,"
(Web Desk) – Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party BJP losing all sense of morality and ethics has resorted to cheap gimmicks to win over voters.
In a recent trick to secure an election win, BJP has made vrial a picture on social media  of the IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthanam, who was captured in the dog fight saga over Pakistani territory by PAF, after India violated Pakistani airspace and tensions mounted between the archrivals this Feb.

The post showcases an Abhinandan twin, wearing the symbolic saffron scarf with BJP’s  symbol ‘lotus,’ implying his vote was for BJP and message on the post reads.
‘Wing Commander Abhinandan ji has openly supported the BJP and even voted to make Modi ji Prime Minister, and he says there is no better Prime Minister than Modi at present, friends make this reach Jihadis and Congressis, you never brought back a jawan alive and today Abhinandan has returned alive and voted for BJP.’
The viral picture itself gives away its falsehood and the Indians are pointing out the deception of the political party.
According to media reports, first and foremost the Indian constitution does not allow serving armed forces personnel to be a part of political campaigns.
‘Under the Air Force Rules, 1969, IAF personnel are not permitted to take part in political activities.’

On closer inspection of the viral picture, one can easily decipher that someone is impersonating Abhinandan.
Despite the doppelganger wearing the handle bar moustache, a clear clue is the mole on the IAF pilot’s chin which is missing from the fibster posing as the pilot.
Secondly, the impersonator himself has a mole under his right eye which is not present on the real Abhinandan’s face. Social media has erupted with Indian citizens themselves exposing the forgery pointing out that this picture is taken in Gujrat while Abhinandan is registered to vote from Tamil Nadu.

Notre-Dame fire in Paris: what we know so far,"
PARIS (AFP) - A fire that spread from the attic of Notre-Dame cathedral on Monday has caused its spire to crash to the ground, and devastated Paris’s historical monument.
This is what we know so far about the violent blaze:

Fire in the attic 


The fire began around 6.50 pm (1650 GMT).
""I was not far away, I saw the smoke. At first I thought it was the Hotel-Dieu (hospital) but then I realised it was the cathedral. When I arrived, ash was beginning to fall,"" said Olivier De Chalus, head volunteer guide of the cathedral.
The cause of the blaze was not immediately known. It spread from the attic, and quickly across a large part of the roof.
The flames devoured the roof’s wooden frame, which is more than 100 metres in length and nicknamed ""the forest"".
An investigation was opened for accidental destruction by fire, Paris prosecutors said.
Investigators were focussed on whether the fire spread from the site of ongoing reconstruction work on the roof of the cathedral, a source close to the investigation said.
Construction workers were spoken to Monday evening by investigators, the department said.

Fire ‘under control’ 


Firefighters announced early Tuesday the fire was ""completely under control"" and ""partially extinguished"". Only ""residual fires"" were still burning.
Around 11.00 pm (2100 GMT), they announced that the structure of the cathedral had been ""saved and preserved"".
From the moment the fire was spotted, a major emergency operation was put in place to contain the blaze.
Four hundred firefighters with 18 fire hoses, some perched on cranes tens of metres off the ground, battled to contain the fire as quickly as possible.
However, using water-bombing aircraft -- as suggested by US President Donald Trump -- was not considered: ""If used, (this) could lead to the collapse of the entire structure of the cathedral,"" France’s civil security service tweeted.

Extent of damage 


At around 7.50 pm (1750 GMT), the cathedral’s spire -- one of Paris’s most famous landmarks at 93 metres high -- collapsed.
Within a few hours, a large part of the roof had been reduced to ashes.
The extent of the damage inside the cathedral was not yet known by around 11.00 pm (2100 GMT).
""The fire affected two-thirds of the roof, which has collapsed, as well as the spire,"" said Paris fire brigade chief Jean-Claude Gallet, adding that the operation was focussed on preserving the rear of the cathedral where the most valuable works are located.
The Holy Crown of Thorns and a sacred tunic worn by 13th-century French king Louis, two irreplaceable artifacts, had been rescued, the cathedral rector Patrick Chauvet said.

‘Years of work’ 

Restoring the building will take ""years of work"", said the newly elected president of the Bishops’ Conference of France, Eric de Moulins-Beaufort.
In response to ""multiple requests"" the Fondation du patrimoine, a hertitage organisation, will Tuesday launch a ""national collection"" for the reconstruction of Notre-Dame, Anne Le Breton, deputy mayor of the French capital’s 4th arrondissement, said in a statement to AFP.
Overnight the Pinault family, one of the richest in France, pledged 100 million euros ($113 million) for Notre-Dame.
French President Emmanuel Macron, who headed to the scene, said a ""national undertaking"" would be launched, and that ""far beyond our borders, we will appeal to the greatest talents... who will contribute, and we will rebuild"". ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-16-19/news_big_images/487245_23209318.jpg,world,"""The fire affected two-thirds of the roof, which has collapsed, as well as the spire,"" said Paris fire brigade chief Jean-Claude Gallet, adding that the operation was focussed on preserving the rear of the cathedral where the most valuable works are located.",neutral
British police arrest 113 climate change activists after London roads blocked,"
LONDON (Reuters) - British police have arrested 113 people after climate change activists blocked some of London’s most famous roads including Oxford Circus, Marble Arch and Waterloo Bridge in an attempt force the government to do more to tackle climate change.

The protests, led by British climate group Extinction Rebellion, brought parts of central London to a standstill on Monday and some stayed overnight for a second day of protest on Tuesday.

Extinction Rebellion, which generated headlines with a semi-nude protest in the House of Commons earlier this month, is demanding the government declare a climate and ecological emergency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025.

“There have been 113 arrests in total, the majority of which are for breach of Section 14 Notice of the Public Order Act 1986 and obstruction of the highway,” London police said.

Tents littered the roads at Oxford Circus with some activists huddled beneath a pink boat with the words “Tell the Truth” across its side. One placard read: “Rebel for Life”.

Police said five of those arrested had been detained after the Shell building near the River Thames was targeted.

Two protesters on Monday scaled up scaffolding writing ‘Shell Knows!’ in red paint on the front of the building and three protesters glued their hands to the revolving doors at the entrance.

"Notre-Dame fire under control, Macron vows to rebuild","
PARIS (AFP) - A raging fire that tore through Notre-Dame Cathedral in central Paris was under control early Tuesday after the blaze brought its towering spire and roof crashing to the ground, wiping out centuries of priceless heritage central to French culture and history.
French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to rebuild the cathedral described as the soul of the nation and expressed relief that ""the worst had been avoided"" in a blaze that had at one point threatened the entire edifice.
Thousands of Parisians and tourists watched in horror from nearby streets cordoned off by the police as flames engulfed the building and officials tried to save as much as they could of the cathedral’s countless treasures, built up over centuries.
The inferno destroyed the roof of the 850-year-old UNESCO world heritage landmark, whose spectacular Gothic spire collapsed as orange flames and clouds of grey smoke billowed into the early evening sky.
Around 400 firefighters battled into the night to control the flames, declaring in the early hours of Tuesday that it was partially extinguished but completely under control, around nine hours after it broke out.
Paris fire brigade chief Jean-Claude Gallet said ""we can consider that the main structure of Notre-Dame has been saved and preserved"" as well as the two bell towers.
But ""the whole of the roof has been devastated... a part of the vault has collapsed, the spire is no more"", fire brigade spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gabriel Plus said.
Laurent Nunez, state secretary at the interior ministry, told reporters early Tuesday that with the immediate ""danger of the fire over,"" the focus would be on assessing the damage to the building’s structure.
Nunez said officials would meet shortly to see if the building was stable enough to allow fire services to go inside.

‘France is Notre Dame’ 


""Notre-Dame survived all the wars, all the bombardments. We never thought it could burn. I feel incredibly sad and empty,"" Stephane Seigneurie, a consultant who joined other shocked onlookers in a solemn rendition of ""Ave Maria"" as they watched the fire from a nearby bridge.
Gasps and cries of ""Oh my god"" erupted around an hour after the fire first broke out when the top portion of the church’s spire came crashing down.
""We have been dealt a knockout blow,"" a stricken-looking Paris Archbishop Michel Aupetit told reporters.
The cause of the blaze was not immediately clear, but the cathedral had been undergoing intense restoration work which the fire service said could be linked to the blaze.
French prosecutors said it was being currently being treated as an accident.
Historians expressed dismay at the collapse of a building that has been a symbol of France for almost a millennium.
""If Paris is the Eiffel Tower then France is Notre Dame. It’s the entire culture, entire history of France incarnated in this monument,"" Bernard Lecomte, a writer and specialist in religious history told BFM TV.
Deputy Paris mayor Emmanuel Gregoire told the channel that workers were scrambling ""to save all the artworks that can be saved.""
Officials later said teams had managed to salvage an unknown quantity of the cultural treasures.

‘Emotion of a nation’ 


Macron cancelled a planned national policy speech on recent ""Yellow Vest"" protests and instead headed to the scene, where he vowed the cathedral would be reborn.
""We will rebuild Notre-Dame because it is what the French expect,"" he said, describing Notre Dame as ""the epicentre of our life"" and the cathedral of ""all the French"", whether religious or not.
France’s billionaire Pinault dynasty immediately pledged 100 million euros for the reconstruction effort.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Notre-Dame cathedral a ""symbol of European culture"" as the blaze raged.
The Vatican on Monday expressed its ""incredulity"" and ""sadness"" over the fire.

‘Water bombers not used’ 


One firefighter was injured in the blaze, the fire brigade said, revising an earlier assessment that the individual was in a serious condition.
US President Donald Trump in a tweet said it was ""horrible"" to watch the fire but caused controversy by offering advice on how to put it out.
""Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!"" he said.
But France’s civil security service, which oversees crisis management in the country, tweeted back at Trump that the use of water-bombing aircraft was not being considered.
""If used, (this) could lead to the collapse of the entire structure of the cathedral,"" it said.

‘Will never be the same’ 


The cathedral is located at the very centre of the French capital and its construction was completed in the mid-12th century after some 200 years of work.
During the French Revolution in the 18th century, the cathedral was vandalised in widespread anti-clerical violence: its spire was dismantled, its treasures plundered and its large statues at the grand entrance doors destroyed.
It would go on to feature as a central character in a Victor Hugo novel published in 1831, ""The Hunchback of Notre-Dame"" and shortly afterwards a restoration project lasting two decades got under way, led by architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc.
The building survived the devastation of two global conflicts in the 20th century and famously rang its bells on August 24, 1944, the day of the Liberation of Paris from German occupation at the end of the World War II.
""Paris is disfigured. The city will never be like it was before,"" said Philippe, a communications worker in his mid-30s.
Jacky Lafortune, a 72-year-old artist and self-described atheist stood forlornly on the banks of the River Seine staring at the burning cathedral.

Yemen parties agree details of pullback plan: UN envoy,"
UNITED NATIONS (AFP) - Yemen s government and Huthi rebels have accepted a detailed plan for a much-delayed pullback from the flashpoint city of Hodeida, the UN envoy said Monday, but no timetable was announced for the withdrawals.
The redeployment of forces was agreed in December under a ceasefire deal reached in Sweden that offered the best hope in years of moving toward an end to the war that has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.
UN envoy Martin Griffiths told the Security Council that ""both parties have now accepted a detailed redeployment plan"" for the first stage of the pullback from Hodeida.
Griffiths said he received assurances from Huthi leader Abdul Malik al Huthi when they met in Sanaa last week that his forces would support the Hodeida agreement, but the envoy sounded a note of caution after so many delays.
""Let us be clear that when -- and I hope it is when and not if -- these redeployments happen, they will be the first voluntary withdrawal of forces in this long conflict,"" he said by videoconference from Amman.
The United Nations announced a deal on the two-stage pullback from Hodeida city and its ports in February, but the redeployment failed to materialize on the ground and the peace effort has since stalled.
The United States put the onus on the Huthis to unblock the process and begin redeployments as agreed in the plan.
""The Yemeni government has demonstarted a clear commitment to the United Nations led process,"" acting US Ambassador Jonathan Cohen told the Security Council.
""It is time for the Huthis to also show the international community that they too are serious about the UN process and the agreements that they themselves reached in Stockholm,"" he said.
The United States, which has supported the Saudi-led coalition backing the government in Yemen s war, also accused the Huthis of blocking access to a food storage site that contains enough grain to feed 3.7 million people for a month.
The Red Sea Mills ""remain closed and the food stocks within may be rotten,"" said Cohen.  ""At this point only the Huthis are blocking access to the Mills and they alone will be to blame if the food spoils.""
The Red Sea port of Hodeida is the entry point for the bulk of imported goods and relief aid to Yemen.
The detailed plan on the pullback was negotiated by Danish General Michael Lollesgaard who heads a UN monitoring mission.
Following the deal on the first stage, Lollesgaard will now focus on the second phase and seek to resolve disputes over the deployment of local forces in areas from where there has been a pullback.
Griffiths said he was laying the groundwork for broader serious negotiations on ending the war in Yemen but added: ""We all need to see tangible progress in Hodeida before moving to focus on the political solution.""
The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 to push back an advance by Huthi rebels who continue to hold the capital Sanaa, and restore Hadi to power.
The conflict has unleashed the world s worst humanitarian conflict, according to the United Nations, with millions facing famine.

MoC stressed to approach SA authorities for waiving anti-dumping duty on cement ,"
KARACHI (Dunya News) – Pakistan-South Africa Business Forum (PSABF) Chairman Mohammad Rafiq Memon has said that Pakistan’s cement exports to South Africa have suffered terribly during the last couple of years because of the anti-dumping duty imposed by the South African government that resulted in shrinking cement export to around US$100 to US$150 million which was around US$700 million prior to imposition of anti-dumping duty. 
“We are trying our best to get this issues resolved but Pakistan’s Ministry of Commerce (MoC) also has to send a delegation to South Africa in order to convince the authorities to review and waive this anti-dumping duty on cement”, he stressed while speaking at a meeting during the visit of South African delegation to Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Chairman PSABF was fairly optimistic that the South African government would review the anti-dumping duty on cement imports and the situation was likely to improve by 2020, provided the Ministry of Commerce takes up this issue with relevant authority in South Africa.
President PSABF (Pakistan Region) Ghulam Muhammad, Senior Vice President KCCI Khurram Shahzad, Vice President KCCI Asif Sheikh Javaid, Members of South African delegation and KCCI’s Managing Committee were also present at the meeting.
While requesting KCCI to participate in the forthcoming events being organised by PSABF in South Africa, he informed that PSABF plans to organise a 4-day seminar in the month of July 2019 which will be followed by a single country exhibition in October 2019 to highlight Pakistan’s trade potential. “Both these events in South Africa will provide a perfect opportunity to industrialists and traders from KCCI to introduce their products and services in South Africa which is a gateway to the entire African region”, he added.
He said that PSABF also plans to establish a trade center in South Africa by December 2019 where Pakistani manufacturers and exporters will be able to display samples of their products and services along with relevant contact information, which would results in effectively promoting Pakistani products not only in the South African market but also other African states.
“As Pakistan’s trade and diplomatic relations have not been so well with South Africa, therefore we are striving really hard to improve ties between the two countries”, he said, adding that potential exists to enhance trade and investment ties in tourism, textile, agriculture, pharmaceutical, mining and construction sectors. “Many South African investors are also interested in Pakistan’s hospitality, tourism and aviation sectors. They also want to establish mini zoos, Safari Parks and resorts in Karachi and Gilgit-Baltistan”, he added.
He mentioned that PSABF, which was formed in 2014, has enhanced its activities and the forum has been regularly holding negotiations with South African government and other stakeholders with a view to enhance trade and investment ties between the two countries. During the past four years, PSABF has received and facilitated 27 delegations from Pakistan and they look forward to receiving a delegation from Karachi Chamber in near future. “PSABF is not just confined to South Africa only but we have expanded our activities to nine more countries in the African region”, he added.
Senior Vice President KCCI Khurram Shahzad, while welcoming the South African delegates, assured to take up the anti-dumping issue being faced by Pakistani cement exporters with Ministry of Commerce so that the government could hold negotiations with relevant authorities in South Africa.
He pointed out that the economic relations between Pakistan and South Africa have remained cordial and it was really heartening to see that eight MoUs were signed during Pakistan-South Africa Joint Commission meeting in 2013 to increase trade value between countries to $1 billion which was finally achieved in 2017.
He said, “Pakistan and South Africa share moderate bilateral trade relations as we exported goods worth $178.15 million in 2018 to South Africa while our imports stood at $1.24 billion.”
Khurram Shahzad was of the opinion that there was a huge potential to enhance bilateral trade relations between Pakistan and South Africa. In this regard, Pakistan can increase its leather footwear exports to South Africa at competitive prices.
“CPEC depicts a great opportunity for Pakistan to further enhance its trade volume to South Africa”, he said, adding that Pakistan can also export meat products to South Africa market, as the country relies significantly on imported meat from Brazil and European countries.
He further stressed that both countries can enhance their mutual cooperation and knowledge transfer in the mining sector. For this purpose, Balochistan province offers a wonderful opportunity for both Pakistani and South-African companies to take different joint ventures.
He emphasised that the Karachi Chamber wants to promote business, mutual understanding and friendly relations between the business communities of Pakistan and South Africa. “We want to promote and do everything for the development of Pakistan–South Africa business cooperation”, he added.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-18-19/news_big_images/487495_20777877.jpg,business,"“We want to promote and do everything for the development of Pakistan–South Africa business cooperation”, he added.",neutral
"ADB releases annual report, financial results for 2018","
ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – The Asian Development Bank (ADB) released its Annual Report for 2018 on Tuesday. 
The report presents ADB’s important operational and organizational milestones over the past year, including key numbers and data of ADB operations, activities, and financial results.
It also focuses on the adoption of ADB’s new long-term corporate strategy, Strategy 2030, approved in July 2018, and highlights the strategic transition in progress across all aspects of ADB’s operations and organization.
The demand for ADB assistance continued to grow in 2018. New commitments included $21.6 billion in loans, grants, and investments from ADB’s own resources, exceeding the target of $19.71 billion and up 10% from 2017.
Private sector operations reached $3.14 billion, a 37% increase from 2017, which is 14.5% of ADB’s overall commitment. The result reflected ADB’s long-term strategy to increase support for private enterprise, especially in new markets and sectors, to create more high-quality jobs and to mobilize private financial resource for development.
ADB also successfully mobilized $14 billion in cofinancing from bilateral and multilateral agencies and other financing partners, including $7.17 billion in co-financing from ADB’s private sector operations. The increase in co-financing saw total new commitments reach $35.82 billion in 2018, a 13% increase over 2017, reflecting the importance of partnerships in addressing Asia and the Pacific’s continuously growing development needs.
Disbursements, a key indicator for successful project implementation, also improved, rising to $14.19 billion in 2018, an increase of 24% from 2017.
In his message to stakeholders in the report, ADB President Takehiko Nakao said that Strategy 2030 had energized ADB and positioned the Manila-based lender well to help countries in Asia and the Pacific cope with the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
“As our region continues to develop and transform, so too must ADB,” said Nakao. “Strategy 2030 provides us with a clear roadmap to meet the needs of our developing member countries (DMCs) and guide our operations for the next decade. We set out clear corporate targets to significantly increase operations, to build climate and disaster resilience, address gender equality, and mobilize long-term private financing.”
ADB continued to deliver on its climate commitments in 2018 with $3.6 billion in financing approved. ADB is on target to double its annual climate financing to $6 billion in approvals by 2020.
ADB also made significant progress in designing projects with a gender focus. In 2018, 47% of ADB’s support, on a three-year-average term, included elements that directly improved the lives of women and girls in the region.
The report also records ADB’s successful efforts to strengthen its role as a leading provider of development knowledge and expertise to DMCs seeking support to implement policies, programs, and projects that utilize international best practices and learnings.

"Gold slips to Rs70,850 per tola ","
KARACHI (Dunya News) – Following decrease in gold rate in international market, the current rate of 24K per tola has reduced by Rs150 to Rs70,850.
Likewise, the gold rate 24K per 10 grams has reduced to Rs60,872 with the decrease of Rs130, whereas the rate of 22K gold per 10 grams has slipped to Rs55,681.
Moreover, the sliver rate sustained at Rs900 per tola.
On Tuesday, gold slipped for a fourth straight as recent upbeat economic data and signs that Washington and Beijing were making headway in a nearly year-long tariff skirmish boosted risk sentiment.
Better economic conditions stoke investors to pivot towards equities that are interest-bearing assets, and shun the non-yielding bullion.
Spot gold was down 0.2 percent at $1,285.39 per ounce, as of 0734 GMT. In the previous session, the bullion dropped to $1,281.96, its weakest since April 4.
U.S. gold futures shed 0.2 percent to $1,288.30 an ounce.
“The main reason what pressures gold is the improved economic data ... for countries such as China for example, things have turned around a fair bit,” said analyst Dominic Schneider of UBS Wealth Management in Hong Kong.
China reported better-than-expected credit and export figures last week that allayed concerns regarding the pace of economic growth.
Jobs data from the United States last week also lifted sentiment, assuaging concerns that the largest economy was losing momentum. Data showed the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a 49-1/2-year low.
Asian stocks were close to a nine-month peak on increasing expectations that the Chinese economy would stabilise.
“Equity markets are trading on an even keel, while optimism about a U.S.-China trade deal continues to be very supportive for risk sentiment completely deflating investor appetite for safe-haven plays like gold,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading and market strategy, SPI Asset Management.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told Fox Business Network on Monday trade negotiations between Washington and its Chinese counterparts were “making a lot of progress”.
Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, on Monday dropped to 754.03 tonnes, their lowest since Nov. 9, 2018.
“The other element that pressures gold is the 10-year (yields) in the U.S., which, despite easing yesterday, has been creeping up a bit from its March lows,” Schneider added.
Markets now await key Eurozone and Chinese data, which will provide further clues on the global economic health.
A Reuters poll has meanwhile suggested that despite China’s first-quarter economic growth likely cooling to the weakest pace in at least 27 years, recent stimulus measures would lift the economic mood in the future.
Among other metals, silver dipped 0.2 percent to $14.97 an ounce, having touching a trough since end-December at $14.81 in the previous session.
Spot platinum gained 0.6 percent to $890.63 per ounce, while palladium rose 0.3 percent to $1,365.05 per ounce.

"Oil extends losses into second session; Russia, OPEC output in focus","
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Oil prices edged down on Tuesday after a Russian minister said the nation and OPEC may boost crude output to fight for market share, checking a recent sharp rally driven by tighter global production.
Brent crude oil futures were at $71.08 a barrel at 0111 GMT, down 10 cents, or 0.1 percent, from their last close. Brent ended down 0.5 percent on Monday.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $63.39 per barrel, down 2 cents, or 0.1 percent, from their previous settlement. WTI fell 0.8 percent on Monday.
Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said over the weekend that Russia and OPEC may decide to boost production to fight for market share with the United States, but this would push oil as low as $40 per barrel.
“There is a growing concern that Russia will not agree on extending production cuts and we could see them officially abandon it in the coming months,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst, OANDA.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, known as OPEC+, will meet in June to decide whether to continue withholding supply. That comes after they previously agreed to crimp output by 1.2 million barrels per day from Jan. 1 for six months.
Losses were checked by tighter supplies from Iran and Venezuela amid signs the United States will further toughen sanctions on those two OPEC producers, and on the threat that renewed fighting could wipe out crude production in Libya.

Gas theft worth Rs48 billion should be stopped: Ghiyas Paracha ,"
KARACHI (Dunya News) – All Pakistan CNG Association (APCNGA) on Monday said the load of Rs65 billion suffered on account of sale of LNG should not be recovered from consumers.
The losses include loss of Rs36 billion in the sale of LNG, Rs26 billion didn’t recovered from the domestic consumers on account of gas supplies from Dec 2018 to Feb 2019 and delayed payments from consumers which added to the bank interest.
Speaking at a public hearing by OGRA in Lahore, the central leader of APCNGA Ghiyas Paracha said that recovery of all the losses from CNG and other sector is unjustified and unacceptable.
He said that gas worth Rs48 billion is being stolen of which 93 percent is stolen in the district of Karak in which gas officials are also involved. If gas utilities accord proper attention to the issue it can be resolved in a few months while we are also ready to cooperate in this regard.
Pointing out the weakness in the gas billing and measurements he said that gas utilities are overcharging consumers on account of GCV and gas mix while there is a lack of check and balance.
Ghiyas Paracha said that SNGPL has demanded Rs723 per mmbtu increase in gas tariff and Rs111 per mmbtu increase in LNG tariff which if accepted will make it very expensive discouraging buyers.
He said that the volume of gas continues to increase but the charges of gas distributors are not decreasing but continue to increase which is against the phenomena.
The leader of the CNG sector said that payment for post terminal expanses like regasification, transportation, and UFG should be made in the rupee and not the dollar.
He hoped that if his suggestions were accepted it will reduce the price of gas instead on an increase.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-15-19/news_big_images/487151_45536097.jpg,business,He hoped that if his suggestions were accepted it will reduce the price of gas instead on an increase.,neutral
