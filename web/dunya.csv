Surge in medicines prices put patients' lives in misery,"

"Amid turmoil, NATO in Afghanistan marks anniversary","
(AFP) Ã¢ÂÂ Top NATO officials in Afghanistan on Wednesday heralded key gains from more than 17 years of war, even as the United States seeks to end the grinding conflict that President Donald Trump this week called ""ridiculous"".
Despite hundreds of thousands of troops from NATO having served in Afghanistan since the September 11, 2001 attacks, last year was the bloodiest on record and the Taliban have made gains across the country.
The extremists now control more Afghan territory than any time since they were ousted in the US-led invasion of 2001, and once again are imposing their strict interpretation of Sharia law.
Trump is fed up with the war, which has killed more than 2,300 American troops and cost the US taxpayer more than $1 trillion.
The Afghanistan war is ""unfortunate, itÃÂ s ridiculous,"" Trump said Tuesday in Washington.
In December, he told advisors he wanted to pull about half of AmericaÃÂ s 14,000 troops out of Afghanistan, a decision apparently made without consulting NATO allies.
But in a ceremony marking at NATOÃÂ s 70th anniversary at their intensely fortified compound in Kabul on Wednesday, dignitaries sought to put a positive spin on things.
Afghanistan ""is a modern and vibrant emerging democracy"", said Nicholas Kay, NATOÃÂ s senior civilian representative in Afghanistan.
""We all salute the improvements in womenÃÂ s rights, for millions of children and notably girls enrolled in schools, the free press and notable advancements in health care,"" he added.
That narrative is under increasing pressure, however, with the Taliban growing ever stronger and AfghanistanÃÂ s security forces dealing with horrendous losses.
Last year, a United Nations agency documented 3,804 civilian deaths in Afghanistan, with another 7,819 people injured in the war.

Tough love

Kay was joined by Afghanistan chief executive Abdullah Abdullah and NATOÃÂ s Afghanistan commander General Scott Miller, who championed the allianceÃÂ s enduring ""cohesion"".
""We all remain committed to this nation,"" he said.
Trump, however, has frequently hammered NATO -- accusing longstanding allies of being freeloaders who do not pull their weight on military spending.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has embraced TrumpÃÂ s tough-love approach and credited him with a big increase in member state defence spending.
As for the Afghan gains, many fear AmericaÃÂ s desire to withdraw from Afghanistan will ultimately see the Taliban back in power.
US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad is in Afghanistan this week as part of an ongoing drive to find a way out.
He has met with various Afghan politicians and stakeholders, including women representatives, ahead of an expected new round of peace talks with the Taliban in Doha.
Kay insisted NATO is determined to stay in Afghanistan to protect hard-won gains for Afghans.

German charity ship rescues 64 migrants off Libya,"
ÃÂ 
ROME (AFP) - A German charity rescue ship has picked up 64 migrants, including women and children, stranded off Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean for Europe.

""The authorities were unreachable,"" Watch the Med said of the Libyan coastguard charged with search and rescue operations in the zone off Zouara.
Charities frequently accuse the Libyan authorities of failing to rescue migrants, while rights groups say migrants face abuses in Libya.

Iran flood death toll reaches 62,"
TEHRAN (AFP) - The death toll from major floods swamping much of Iran over the past 15 days has risen to 62, the head of the Iranian Legal Medicine Organisation told local media Wednesday.
Ahmad Shojaee told the semi-official Fars news agency the southern province of Fars has been hit the hardest with 21 dead.
The western province of Lorestan and the northern province of Golestan followed with 14 and 8 dead respectively, he said.
Flood-related deaths have been reported in 11 out of IranÃÂ s 31 provinces, Shojaee added.
The semi-official ISNA news agency said the current toll was a tally of the victims whose bodies have been transferred to coroner offices across the country, indicating the count could still rise.
Iran has been hit by flooding across most of the country since March.
The countryÃÂ s northeast was swamped on March 19 before the west and southwest of the country were inundated on March 25, killing a total 45 people.
Flooding in the west and southwest continued on April 1 when heavy rains returned to the area
""Seventy-eight intercity roads have been blocked, as many as 2,199 rural roads and 84 bridges have been washed away,"" said Behnam Saeedi, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Organisation
""Across 15 provinces, 141 rivers burst their banks and around 400 land slides were reported,"" he told state TV

NATO chief says not seeking 'new Cold War' with Russia,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday that the alliance was not seeking a new ""Cold War"" with Russia.

BJP's Hindu allies quietly put controversial Ayodhya temple plan on backburner,"
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Millions of Hindus will wake up at the crack of dawn this Saturday, five days before the start of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs general election, and march to nearby temples to chant a sacred hymn and renew a pledge to build a Ram temple on the ruins of the 16th-century Babri mosque.
Hardline Hindu allies of Prime Minister Narendra ModiÃ¢ÂÂs ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) say they will mobilise more than 10 million people on April 6 - the start of the Hindu New Year - to shore up support for the contentious plan to build the temple in Ayodhya.
But while the event will keep the focus on a core demand of Hindu nationalists, it will not overtly be part of the BJPÃ¢ÂÂs election campaign, signalling a softer approach by the ruling party, multiple sources familiar with discussions said.
The commitment to construct a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya has been part of the BJPÃ¢ÂÂs election manifesto since the 1990s and has helped the party garner Hindu votes in elections since then.
However, the BJP and its allies are concerned that focusing on the temple issue could be too hot to handle, especially since it is now the party in power. It could worsen communal tensions and trigger religious riots in the country, said a senior BJP leader.
Ã¢ÂÂWe cannot underestimate the power of Hindu fringe groups, and itÃ¢ÂÂs best not to ignite these issues,Ã¢ÂÂ said a BJP leader who is overseeing the partyÃ¢ÂÂs election strategy.
The BJP leader and two other senior party members, two central ministers and four members of hardline Hindu groups, who didnÃ¢ÂÂt wish to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue, said they reached a consensus to fold the temple issue into a broader religious and cultural discourse, without being too vocal about it.
Following a meeting between senior religious leaders and BJP politicians in January, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) or the World Hindu Council, which is leading the movement for building the Ayodhya temple, put its agitation on hold in February.
Details of the meeting have not been published previously.
The VHP, which shares ideological ties with the BJP, would renew its demand only after the general election, its leaders said.
Ã¢ÂÂWhile we remain committed to the cause that is so close to the hearts of Hindus, weÃ¢ÂÂre unanimous in our view that itÃ¢ÂÂs not the right time to amplify the temple issue,Ã¢ÂÂ said Alok Kumar, international working president of the VHP. Ã¢ÂÂPoliticization leads to controversies.Ã¢ÂÂ

HINDU-MUSLIM RIOTS

The VHP has distributed pamphlets and issued appeals on social media to participate in a chanting ceremony aimed at renewing the pledge to build the temple on the spot where many Hindus believe Ram was born, where the mosque stood.
Sanjay Mayukh, a BJP spokesman in New Delhi, declined comment on the April 6 event being organised by the VHP.
Ã¢ÂÂWe wish them (VHP) a success and we will celebrate the Hindu New Year too,Ã¢ÂÂ said Mayukh.
A militant Hindu mob tore down the Babri mosque in 1992, sparking riots that killed about 2,000 people in one of the worst instances of sectarian violence in India since independence in 1947.
The mosque, built in 1528, has been one of the prime causes of conflict between IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs majority Hindus and minority Muslims, who constitute 14 percent of the countryÃ¢ÂÂs 1.3 billion people.
The Supreme Court is now in control of the site in Uttar Pradesh and has been weighing petitions from both communities on what should be built there.
In March, the court appointed an arbitration panel to mediate in the dispute. Its verdict is yet to come.
BJP election candidates confirmed they are avoiding the temple issue in their campaigns.
Former government minister and BJP lawmaker Sanjeev Baliyan, who is contesting the election from a constituency in Uttar Pradesh, said he has instructed supporters to Ã¢ÂÂrefrain from using the Ayodhya issue in any political rally.Ã¢ÂÂ
At least 65 people were killed in clashes between Hindus and Muslims in BaliyanÃ¢ÂÂs constituency in 2013.
Ã¢ÂÂThe danger of any religious tension spilling out of our control would change the election mood. Best to keep religious issues away from politics for now,Ã¢ÂÂ he told Reuters.
Instead, Baliyan said, his campaign would focus on the BJPÃ¢ÂÂs achievements during its last five years in power and national security issues.
Most pollsters expect the BJP to emerge to win the highest number of seats in the election after recent military exchanges between India and arch enemy Pakistan led to a wave of nationalist fervour that has helped Modi.
But the pollsters say the BJP is unlikely to repeat its sweeping victory of 2014 because of the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs inability to provide jobs to the millions of youngsters coming into the job market each year and depressed rural incomes.
The BJP is also under fire from small business owners, traditional supporters of the party, who say they have suffered because of a rocky start to the Goods and Services Tax, IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs biggest tax reform, and ModiÃ¢ÂÂs shock move to ban high-value banknotes in 2016.
The big question may be whether the BJP gets enough seats in the 545-member Lok Sabha to govern without having to form a coalition with other parties.
India begins voting on April 11 and the staggered election is scheduled to end on May 19. Results will be declared on May 23.
Ambuj Nigam, the leader of the Vishwa Hindu Dal, a hardline Hindu group that came into existence in 2018, said the demand for a temple would again gain momentum after the general election.
Ã¢ÂÂWe have put all our controversial works on hold,Ã¢ÂÂ said Nigam. Ã¢ÂÂBut as soon as election results are out, we will bring Hindu nationalism back to the forefront.Ã¢ÂÂ

"UN approves resolution against violence targeting individuals based on religion, belief","
(Web Desk) Ã¢ÂÂ The United Nations General Assembly has adopted a resolution strongly condemning continuing violence and acts of terrorism targeting individuals belonging to religious minorities, based on or in the name of religion or belief.

The resolution, presented by Turkey with PakistanÃ¢ÂÂs support in wake of Christchurch terror attacks was adopted without a vote.

PakistanÃ¢ÂÂs permanent representative Maleeha Lodhi speaking on the occasion said that increasing anti Islam sentiments are threatening world peace. She said Pakistan always supported all efforts to bring the nations and religions closer.

She said Islamophobia and racism go hand in hand.

Ambassador Lodhi, noting that nine victims of the Christchurch attack hailed from Pakistan, said that profiling and stigmatizing people from one country leads to drastic consequences.

Algerian leader Bouteflika ends 20-year rule after mass protests,"
ALGIERS (Reuters) - AlgeriaÃ¢ÂÂs ailing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned on Tuesday, succumbing to six weeks of largely peaceful mass protests driven by youth and pressure from the powerful army against his 20-year rule.

Hundreds took to the streets of the capital after the announcement of the 82-year-oldÃ¢ÂÂs departure, capping protests which called for the removal of an elite seen by many as out of touch with ordinary people and presiding over an economy riven by cronyism.

Earlier in the day, army chief of staff Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Salah demanded the veteran ruler, who has been long in poor health, be declared immediately unfit for office.

State TV later showed a frail-looking Bouteflika, dressed in a traditional winter robe, handing his resignation letter to the head of a constitutional council. Also present was Abdelkader Bensalah, chairman of the upper house of parliament, who will run the country for 90 days until elections are held.

Ã¢ÂÂI have taken this step because I am keen to put an end to the current bickering,Ã¢ÂÂ Bouteflika said in a letter released on state media, using his main means of communication since suffering a stroke in 2013 and largely disappearing from public view.

Western powers, some of which had demanded a peaceful solution, will be relieved that Bouteflika has quit, valuing stability in the OPEC oil producer, which is also a key gas supplier for Europe and partner to fight militants.

Analysts say it was unclear whether the demonstrations will end, however. They were started initially to protest BouteflikaÃ¢ÂÂs plan to seek a fifth mandate but then widened to include calls from some youth and lawyers for wider reforms.

As BouteflikaÃ¢ÂÂs grip on power started to loosen over recent days, some protesters began shifting their focus to rejecting a caretaker government appointed on Sunday.

The lineup included respected technocrats but was headed by Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui, who the opposition said was too close to the ruling elite dominated by business tycoons and veteran fighters of the 1954-62 independence war with France.

Ã¢ÂÂWhat is important to us is that we do not accept the (caretaker) government,Ã¢ÂÂ Mustapha Bouchachi, a lawyer and protest leader, told Reuters before Bouteflika quit. Ã¢ÂÂPeaceful protests will continue.Ã¢ÂÂ

Hundreds of students marched early on Tuesday through the capital Algiers, calling for a new system in a country where more than one in four Algerians under the age of 30 - some 70 percent of the population - are unemployed.

BouteflikaÃ¢ÂÂs supporters had sought to stop the dissent by evoking the 1990s when some 200,000 were killed in civil war with Islamists, warning even of a scenario like Syria, embroiled in an eight-year-long conflict.

But only around one person was confirmed to have died during the protests, a man believed to be around 60 years old who suffered a heart attack, with most rallies peaceful and protesters cleaning up the streets before going home.

In Egypt, more than 800 people were killed in the 2011 uprising that brought down Hosni Mubarak.

CHANGES

Algeria has transformed during the protests, with people losing fear of criticizing the government and state media first ignoring and then, after a mutiny of reporters, covering the dissent.

Supporters in the ruling FLN party and business people gradually abandoned Bouteflika. The military at first stayed in the barracks but step by step increased pressure, first only indirectly in an army magazine editorial saying the military shared the same vision as the people.

Then chief of staff Salah proposed last week to invoke a constitutional clause to remove Bouteflika on health grounds.
In another sign the end was approaching, several oligarchs close to his camp had been banned from travelling abroad in the past few days.

Tuesday started like any other weekday since the protests began, with some students protesting and others going to work after joining a mass rally on Friday, AlgeriaÃ¢ÂÂs weekend.

With many at home or in restaurants at dinner time, TV stations flashed a blitz of comments from Salah that BouteflikaÃ¢ÂÂs removal should happen immediately.

Ã¢ÂÂThere is no more room to waste time ... We decided clearly ... to stand with the people so all their demands get fulfilled,Ã¢ÂÂ Salah said after a meeting with senior officers, state news agency APS said.

A veteran of AlgeriaÃ¢ÂÂs war for independence and the only leader many Algerians have known, Bouteflika was first elected president in 1999 and established himself by ending the civil war.

He had only on Monday said he would quit before the end of his term on April 28 without giving a date. He had also vowed to undertake unspecified measures for the sake of stability, making many wonder what would happen next.

An hour later, he announced he was standing down in a statement posted by APS on Twitter.

Hundreds took to the streets in the city centre, where the Feb. 22 mass protests first broke out, waving Algerian flags.

Yemen rebels deny UN access to food aid: pro-govt source,"
DUBAI (AFP) - Yemeni rebels blocked the UN from accessing vital food aid near the flashpoint port city of Hodeida, a pro-government source said Tuesday.
More than 100 workers were denied access to the Red Sea mills warehouse, said a source in the Saudi-led coalition fighting on the side of the Yemeni government.
""Unfortunately, the Huthi (rebels) have decided to once again renege on a previous commitment, denying the team access to the mills,"" the source told AFP.
In February, a team from the UNÃÂ s World Food Programme visited the Red Sea mills warehouse for the first time since September, when they became inaccessible due to the conflict between pro-government forces and the Iran-aligned Huthi rebels.
The WFP said laboratory tests confirmed the wheat had been infested with insects and had to be fumigated to feed million of people.
WFP spokesman Herve Verhoosel told AFP Tuesday the mission planned by the UN agency to the Red Sea mills was postponed due to ""security reasons"".
Before the UN lost access in September the Red Sea mills held 51,000 tonnes of grain, which was enough to feed more than 3.7 million people for a month.
This comes after an agreement was struck in Sweden in February, in which Yemeni rivals agreed to redeploy their fighters outside the ports and away from areas that are key to the humanitarian relief effort.
The ports are in the rebel-held west of the country, and the agreement especially set out free access to the Red Sea mills warehouses, under control of the Saudi-backed government forces.
YemenÃÂ s war escalated in March 2015, when a Saudi-backed coalition intervened against the Iran-aligned Huthi rebels.
Since then, the conflict has killed around 10,000 people -- most of them civilians -- and has left more than 60,000 wounded, according to the World Health Organization.

Red Cross wants to send IS children back,"
NEW YORK (AFP) - The International Red Cross wants hundreds of children of foreign fighters from the Islamic State group in Syria to be allowed to return to their countries of origin and possibly be reunited with family there, the ICRC president said Tuesday.
The children are living without their parents at the Al-Hol camp in northeastern Syria that holds between 80,000 and 100,000 people displaced in the assault by US-backed forces against the last IS holdout.
About 10,000 foreign women and children with ties to IS foreign fighters are held in a separate area of the camp, with children under 12 accounting for two-thirds of this group.
""Our priority is to proactively look to bring kids back to their country of origin where there are hopefully still family if there are unaccompanied,"" Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC), told reporters.
Foreigners at Al-Hol camp are from some 30 to 40 countries.
Once the identity of the children is established, the Red Cross will notify governments and see if there is family in those countries ""to which we can send the kids back"", Maurer told reporters.
He did not have a specific figure for the number of children without their parents at Al-Hol camp, but estimated that there were ""certainly hundreds, maybe more.""
With the collapse of the last IS bastion in Syria last month, several governments have been grappling with the problem of what to do with captured jihadist fighters from their country, the women who married them and their children.
The ICRC president complained that governments were showing little interest in tackling the problem of foreign nationals linked to IS, limiting their response to offering emergency assistance.
""ThatÃÂ s not really the big issue,"" said Maurer. ""The big issue will be: how do we find a system which deals with the different categories of people, which tries to identify who is a victim, to look at individual cases,"" he said.
France last month took in five orphans, but it has a case-by-case approach to the return of the children.

"Floods hit 40,000 displaced people in northwest Syria: UN","
BEIRUT (AFP) - More than 40,000 displaced people in northwestern Syria have seen their camps flooded by heavy rains in the past three days, a United Nations spokesman said Tuesday.
Around 14 camps were affected in the northwestern province of Idlib, David Swanson of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs told AFP.
The Idlib region, controlled by SyriaÃÂ s former Al-Qaeda affiliate, is home to more than 3 million people -- more than half of them displaced by the countryÃÂ s eight-year war.
Civil defence workers known as the White Helmets have been working to save people and their scant belongings from the rising muddy waters.
""For the second day in a row, White Helmets... continue to respond to the catastrophic situation in the northern Syria camps,"" they said on Twitter late Monday.
One video posted by the group on Sunday showed brown water cascading out of a flooded tent.
In another published the same day, civil defence workers clung on to a rope as they waded through a brown torrent above knee level.
The downpour has affected tens of thousands of civilians, displaced persons, crops and livestock in Idlib, as well as in the Aleppo and Hasakeh provinces since Saturday, Swanson said.
In Aleppo province, tents were destroyed in several camps for the displaced and a hospital in the countryside had to shut down due to the flooding.
SyriaÃÂ s war has killed more than 370,000 people and displaced millions since starting in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.
Tens of thousands of displaced Syrians in the north of the country depend on handouts from humanitarian aid groups, including food, blankets and heating fuel for the winter months.

"Britain, France, Germany seek full UN report of Iran missile activity","
UNITED NATIONS (AFP) - Britain, France and Germany are accusing Iran of developing missile technology, following recent activities, that they said was inconsistent with a UN resolution, and are calling for a full UN report, according to a letter released Tuesday.
The European trio cited IranÃÂ s launch of a space vehicle and the unveiling of two new ballistic missiles in February as forming ""part of trend of increased activity inconsistent"" with the resolution, according to the letter sent to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.
UN Security Council Resolution 2231 -- adopted just after the 2015 nuclear deal -- calls on Iran ""not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons.""
Tehran insists that its missile program is defensive and that it has no intention of developing a nuclear capability.
The three countries asked Guterres to ""report fully and throughly on Iranian ballistic missile activity"" in his next report, which is expected in June.
The letter from the European countries, which are signatories to the nuclear deal along with the United States and Russia, came nearly a month after the United States made a similar appeal to the council, saying it was time to bring back tougher international restrictions on Tehran.
President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the nuclear accord in May last year and reimposed sanctions on Iran, citing concerns about missile development among its reasons.
At a council meeting in December, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for tighter restrictions on Iran to curb its missile program but Russia flatly asserted that there was no proof that IranÃÂ s missiles can carry a nuclear payload.
The European countries said the Safir space launch vehicle used for a satellite blastoff on February 6 is based on two other missiles and uses technology closely related to the development of long-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles.
On February 7, the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards unveiled the Dezful surface-to-surface missile which they claimed had a range of 1,000 kilometers, according to the letter sent on March 25.
During a public display in Tehran on February 4, Iran revealed a variant of the Khorramshahr ballistic missile that the letter said was ""potentially an intermediate-range ballistic missile.""
Iran reined in most of its nuclear program under the landmark nuclear deal with major powers but has kept up development of its ballistic missile technology.

British PM seeks new Brexit delay to approve deal,"
LONDON (AFP) - Prime Minister Theresa May said Tuesday she would ask the EU to delay Brexit again to avoid Britain crashing out of the bloc next week, signalling she could accept a closer relationship with Europe to break months of political deadlock.
After more than seven hours of talks with her ministers, May said she would request a delay that was ""as short as possible and which ends when we pass a deal"" through the British parliament.
In a move which enraged the Brexit-supporting wing of her Conservative Party, she also offered to work with the leader of the main opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, who favours closer ties with the European Union.
""This is a decisive moment in the story of these islands. And it requires national unity to deliver the national interest,"" May said in a televised address.
Corbyn responded saying he was ""very happy"" to meet.
Brussels has set Britain an April 12 deadline to either pass the divorce deal it agreed with May four months ago, settle on an alternative, or leave the EU without an agreement.
In reality, the deadline is even closer as the EU has called an emergency leaders summit for April 10.
EU president Donald Tusk responded cautiously to MayÃÂ s statement, saying: ""Even if, after today, we donÃÂ t know what the end result will be, let us be patient.""
Britain voted by 52 to 48 percent to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum. However, the exit process has only exacerbated divisions among the public and politicians, including MayÃÂ s cabinet.
Her statement follows weeks of turmoil.
MPs have rejected MayÃÂ s divorce deal three times, but after seizing control of the process, were unable to come up with their own plan.
May said she was ""taking action to break the logjam"".
She noted calls in her own party for Britain simply to end its 46-year-old membership of the bloc without any agreement with the EU, but she said that ""leaving with a deal is the best solution"".
May said she believed her existing deal was still necessary for an orderly Brexit, but offered to talk to Labour about a new plan for future trade ties.
Corbyn has called for a new customs union with the EU and close alignment to the blocÃÂ s single market, two things that until now, May has strongly opposed.
""I recognise my responsibility,"" Corbyn said, stressing that the most important issue was ""to make sure we donÃÂ t crash out of the EU next week with no deal"".
Corbyn said any new proposals could be voted on by parliament ""early next week"".
If May and Corbyn could agree on a plan that MPs supported, the prime minister said she hoped to take it to the April 10 Brussels summit.
If not, she promised to allow MPs to direct what she does, expressing hope that Britain could still leave with a deal before May 22, so it did not have to take part in European Parliament elections.
The political chaos has already forced May to ask the EU to postpone the original Brexit date of March 29, but European leaders have warned they will not delay Brexit indefinitely.
French President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday that while he was ""open"" to a lengthy delay on certain conditions, it was ""neither a certainty nor automatic"".
The EUÃÂ s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, warned that the other 27 EU nations were prepared for a ""no deal"" situation, and ""it becomes day after day more likely"".
The EU has repeatedly refused to renegotiate the Brexit divorce deal it agreed with May last November after almost two years of negotiations but has said it could revise the accompanying political declaration on future relations.
""What we need to focus on is our future relationship with the EU,"" May said of her talks with Corbyn.
Key Conservative Brexit-backers slammed MayÃÂ s move.
Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said it was ""very disappointing"" that Corbyn was being given a key role in the Brexit process.
Jacob Rees-Mogg MP suggested the Labour leader could undermined the referendum.

Algeria's President Bouteflika resigns: state TV,"
ALGIERS (AFP) - AlgeriaÃÂ s ailing leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika submitted his resignation with immediate effect, state television said Tuesday, ceding power in the face of massive street protests after two decades at the helm.
Bouteflika ""officially advised the Constitutional Council of the end of his term of office as President of the Republic"" from Tuesday, said a news ticker on the public broadcaster.
Long accused of clinging to power, Bouteflika has come under mounting pressure to step down since his decision to seek a fifth term despite rarely being seen in public after suffering a stroke in 2013.
The 82-year-old, who uses a wheelchair, said last month he would pull out of the bid for another term, and on Monday his office said he would resign before his mandate expires at the end of the month.
The moves failed to satisfy protesters who feared a ploy to extend his rule, with hundreds of students taking to the streets earlier on Tuesday.
The news of his resignation ends 20 years of rule, with the veteran of the independence struggle finally losing his grip after weeks of massive street protests and the loss of support from key loyalists.
Car horns sounded in the street as small crowds of people began gathering to celebrate in Algiers.
AlgeriaÃÂ s constitution says that once the president officially resigns the speaker of the upper house of parliament would act as interim leader for up to 90 days during which a presidential election must be organised.
The resignation came hours after the military demanded impeachment proceedings be launched against Bouteflika immediately as it dismissed the announcement he would resign before his mandate expires.
Armed forces chief Ahmed Gaid Salah called for ""the immediate application of the constitutional procedure for removing the head of state from power"", in a defence ministry statement after a meeting of top brass.
The statement said the army considered an announcement from the presidency on Monday that Bouteflika would resign by the end of his term on April 28 as invalid because it did not come from the president himself.
""Any decision taken outside the constitutional framework is considered null and void,"" the general said.
Without naming anyone, Gaid Salah criticised ""the stubbornness, the procrastination and the deviousness of certain individuals who are trying to make the crisis last and make it more complex with the only concern being their narrow personal interests"".
He said the armyÃÂ s ""sole ambition"" was to ""protect the people from a handful of (other) people who have unduly taken over the wealth of the Algerian people"".
A long-time Bouteflika ally, the general last week called on the president to resign or be declared unfit to rule, becoming one of the first of his faithful supporters to abandon him.
On Monday, the presidency said in a statement that Bouteflika would resign ""before April 28, 2019"", after ""important decisions"" were taken, without specifying when these moves would occur.
The veteran leader would take ""steps to ensure state institutions continue to function during the transition period"", it said in the brief statement that was carried by the official APS news agency.
That announcement was greeted by little sign of euphoria as people insisted that the whole ruling establishment must go.
BouteflikaÃÂ s resignation would not ""change anything"", psychology student Meriem Medjdoub said as she marched in central Algiers earlier Tuesday with around 1,000 protesters.
""We are demanding a radical change,"" she told AFP.
As rumours swirled of frantic behind-the-scenes manoeuvring, prosecutors on Monday announced they had banned corruption suspects from leaving Algeria after launching graft probes against unnamed individuals.
The authorities did not say who was being targeted by probes into corruption and illegal money transfers abroad, but they followed the arrest of the presidentÃÂ s key backer, businessman tycoon Ali Haddad.
Haddad, who Forbes magazine describes as one of AlgeriaÃÂ s wealthiest entrepreneurs, was detained at the weekend at a border post with neighbouring Tunisia.
Bouteflika had named a new government on Sunday, made up mainly of technocrats under recently appointed premier Noureddine Bedoui.
The administration -- supposed to steer the country towards transition -- included General Gaid Salah remaining in his position as deputy defence minister.
Among the other key Bouteflika backers is his younger brother and special adviser Said, who was frequently cited in the past as a likely successor to the president.
Discreet and rarely seen in public, Said Bouteflika has exerted increasing influence behind the scenes as his brotherÃÂ s health woes worsened, but the presidentÃÂ s resignation could take away much of his power.

Pentagon expects Turkey to buy US missile system,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - US Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said Tuesday he was confident that Turkey would drop its plan to purchase the Russian S-400 missile defense system and buy the US Patriot system instead.
A day after Washington put a freeze on its joint F-35 fighter jet program with Turkey in protest to the S-400 deal, Shanahan said he expects Ankara to opt for the Patriot missiles.
That would then allow the F-35 program to continue, he confirmed.
""IÃÂ ve had a number of conversations with Defense Minister (Hulusi) Akar and I really think weÃÂ ll resolve this situation with our strategic partners,"" he said.
""I am very confident in the Patriot proposal that weÃÂ ve delivered to Turkey, its availability, its pricing, and very importantly, the industrial participation that comes along with the Patriot system.""
Asked if that meant he expects Turkey will buy the Patriot system, Shanahan replied: ""I expect weÃÂ ll solve the problem so that they have the right defense equipment in terms of Patriots and F-35s.""
As for the F-35s planned for Turkey, he said: ""I expect them to be delivered.""
On Monday, the Pentagon said it was halting all deliveries and joint work with Turkey on the F-35 if Ankara insisted on buying the S-400 system from Russia, a move which has alarmed TurkeyÃÂ s NATO allies.
The tough step came after months of warnings from Washington that TurkeyÃÂ s adoption of Russian missile technology alongside US fighter jets would pose a threat to the F-35 technology and endanger Western defenses.
""Pending an unequivocal Turkish decision to forgo delivery of the S-400, deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of TurkeyÃÂ s F-35 operational capability have been suspended while our dialogue on this important matter continues with Turkey,"" the Pentagon said in a statement.
Later, Marine Corps General Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reiterated that the US had made Turkey a ""very good offer"" on the Patriot system.
""The S-400 and the F-35, weÃÂ ve made it very clear those are incompatible systems,"" Dunford said. ""But weÃÂ re still working our way through this. And I hope we can come up with an arrangement with Turkey.""
""So we havenÃÂ t given up yet is the bottom line.""
The purchase of a Russian system is highly unusual for a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Western alliance forged to counter the Soviet Union.
But Dunford maintained that the US-Turkey relationship is solid.
""I have every confidence and I spent a lot of time, as you know, with our Turkish allies, and I have every confidence that our areas of convergence are far more than any areas of divergence in the Turkish relationship,"" he said.
The US suspension announcement came two days before foreign ministers from NATOÃÂ s 29 members were due in Washington to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the alliance.
Last week, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu met in Turkey with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and insisted that the S-400 purchase would go ahead.

Trump administration steps up threats to 'shut down' Mexico border,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - The Trump administration stepped up its threat to close down the US-Mexico border on Tuesday, warning both Congress and Central American governments to take action to stem the flow of migrants into the country.
""The presidentÃ¢ÂÂs not threatening. HeÃ¢ÂÂs taking his job as the commander in chief very seriously in terms of protecting the American people,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.
Closing the border is ""not our first choice,"" she said. However, she added, ""Maybe that itÃ¢ÂÂs the best decision.""
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen cut short an official trip to Europe to return for meetings early Tuesday on the border crisis.
And DHS officials said border crossing times were already lengthening as they divert staff to areas between official ports to deal with tens of thousands of migrant families crossing illegally into the country.
A senior Homeland Security official, who declined to be named, told reporters that a definitive solution on border closures had not been made yet.
""The bottom line is all options are on the table right now,"" he said.
""We are in a full blown emergency,"" he said.
""The volume of vulnerable populations thatÃ¢ÂÂs arriving is unsustainable. The humanitarian situation cannot be ignored and the security situation cannot be ignored.""
On Saturday Trump said in a tweet that he was prepared to shut border crossings to force Mexico to halt the flood of migrants fleeing poverty and violence in Central America.
Officials said the number being detained for crossing the border illegally has reached near 100,000 a month, mostly from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
""Mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the USA. Our detention areas are maxed out & we will take no more illegals. Next step is to close the Border!""
The warning stirred fears across border populations who cross legally daily for business, family visits and other reasons.
But it also shook US and Mexican industry, which depend heavily on the open border for trade in everything from farm goods to auto parts.
Delays for incoming traffic at key ports mounted Monday, hitting three hours at Brownsville, Texas, as port staff was diverted to dealing with migrants.
DHS says that besides getting Mexico to block the transit of migrant caravans to the border, Congress should take immediate action to give border officials the power to forcibly repatriate Central American illegal immigrants, including children who arrived alone, back to their countries.

"Trump punts on health care, Democrats go on offense","
WASHINGTON (AFP) - Emboldened Democrats on Tuesday demanded Donald TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs administration end its assault on the Affordable Care Act, after the US president said he would not seek to replace the health law until after next yearÃ¢ÂÂs election.
Trump thrust health care back into the spotlight last week when the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced it was siding with a court ruling declaring the Barack Obama-era reforms unconstitutional.
But late Monday Trump essentially punted away the problem of crafting a quick solution, after several Republicans warned that there was no coherent Obamacare replacement ready.
A new Republican plan ""will be far less expensive & much more usable than ObamaCare,"" Trump tweeted.
""Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win back the House,"" he added. ""It will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America.""
TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs messaging essentially turns health care into a 2020 campaign issue.
Democrats, sensing an opening, gathered on the steps outside the US Supreme Court to announce resolutions in the House and Senate calling for Trump and the DOJ to reverse their position.
""The president has been trying to do away with the Affordable Care Act from day one,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, noting how the move would bump some 20 million people off their insurance and end protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs position a ""callous legal assault on AmericansÃ¢ÂÂ health care,"" as he mocked the president for suddenly delaying his own plan.
""Translation: They have no health-care plan,"" Schumer said.
""What a ruse. What a shame. What a disgrace... The American people will not stand for the president playing cynical games with health care.""
The Justice Department had previously said it backed parts of Obamacare. But in its new position, it said it sided fully with the December ruling in a Texas federal court by Judge Reed OÃÂ Connor following a lawsuit brought by conservative states.
That ruling is being appealed and the resulting impasse looks increasingly likely to end up in the Supreme Court putting a politically radioactive issue center stage in the middle of a heated presidential campaign.
Democrats have stressed that dismantling Obamacare would end protections for people with pre-existing conditions and allow insurers to deny coverage to cancer patients, charge women more due to their gender, and raise rates on seniors.
Trump caught fellow Republicans off guard when he pivoted to health care shortly after Special Counsel Robert Mueller submitted his report on Russian interference in the 2016 US elections.
Republicans overall showed little appetite to focus on the issue, particularly after the 2018 midterm elections when health care proved a winning campaign argument for Democrats.

Hamas leader says rocket that hit Israeli house fired in error,"
GAZA CITY (AFP) - Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said Tuesday the rocket from Gaza that hit a house in Israel last week launched due to a technical error, his first official statement on the strike.
The rocket that was fired from the Gaza Strip on March 25 destroyed a house north of Tel and injured seven Israelis.
Israel responded by striking a series of Hamas targets in the Palestinian enclave, including flattening HaniyehÃ¢ÂÂs office, before Egypt brokered a ceasefire that prevented a full conflict.
In his comments on Tuesday, Haniyeh said the rocket was ""due to a technical defect, but was a mini demonstration if (Israel) thought to commit folly against the Palestinian people.""
The statement from his office said he made the remarks during a meeting with political analysts.
He did not provide further details on what type of technical defect could have caused the launch.
Previously only unnamed officials from Hamas, the Islamist movement that rules Gaza, have said the rocket was fired due to a technical error.
Following the latest ceasefire, Hamas said Egypt had brokered a truce that would see Israel ease its crippling blockade of the enclave in exchange for calm.
Israel has not publicly commented on the reported agreement.
On Monday, Israel expanded the fishing zone around Gaza, increasing it in one area to the largest distance in years, in what Hamas officials said was the first step.
An Egyptian security delegation visited Gaza late Monday and met with Hamas.
Haniyeh said the delegation brought a timetable from the Israeli side for implementing the agreements.

NATO head to meet chief critic Trump,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg visits the White House on Tuesday to meet the Western military allianceÃ¢ÂÂs biggest partner and now critic - US President Donald Trump.
The White House visit comes before two days of talks in Washington among the 29 foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with the specter of Russia again topping the agenda.
The occasion is meant to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the alliance, which since the end of World War II has cemented Europe and the United States in a partnership fusing military strength with shared democratic values.
But even as NATOÃ¢ÂÂs once implacable foe Moscow is again rising up the agenda, the alliance is struggling with an unexpected new source of turmoil: TrumpÃÂ s heated criticism of an organization he claims is taking the United States for a ride.
Trump, in an unlikely role for the president of NATOÃ¢ÂÂs founding member, has long questioned the usefulness of the alliance and characterized fellow members as freeloaders relying on the US defensive umbrella and giving little in return.
He has derisively questioned why NATO would defend tiny Montenegro and has been incensed that Germany, EuropeÃ¢ÂÂs largest economy, is not on track to meet a NATO target for each country to spend 2.0 percent of GDP on defense.
Stoltenberg, speaking to reporters before leaving NATOÃ¢ÂÂs home base of Brussels, agreed that Germany should live up to commitments from a NATO summit in 2014.
""I expect Germany to make good on the pledge Germany made together with all other NATO allies,"" said Stoltenberg, a former prime minister of Norway.
""I expect them to meet spending commitments, and they have submitted to NATO a national plan where they outline how Germany will increase defense spending in real terms by 80 percent over a decade.""
NATO foreign ministers will discuss the ""importance of fair burden-sharing"" during a working lunch on Thursday, a State Department official said.
""We anticipate there will be by the end of the 2020 more than $100 billion in additional new spending from our allies on defense, but of course there is also more work to be done and, as the secretary general said in Brussels, there needs to be a new sense of urgency on this,"" the official told reporters on condition of anonymity.
ÃÂ 
Further steps on Ukraine
ÃÂ 
If spending questions are dividing NATO, most alliance members share concerns about Russia which backs separatists in a low-intensity war in Ukraine from which it seized the Crimean peninsula in 2014.
""We will be looking at ways to do more in the whole Black Sea region. We will be doing more surveillance, there will be more ships in the Black Sea from NATO countries, and there are sanctions that have already been imposed"" over actions against Ukraine, Hutchison said.
Stoltenberg said the foreign ministers will likely agree to step up support to Ukraine as well as Georgia, including through training maritime forces and coast guards and further port visits and exercises.
He said NATO will also discuss further steps after the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty, with the United States and its allies saying that a Russian missile system has negated the key Cold War pact.
Stoltenberg will address a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday.
But the anniversary will be comparatively low-key, with NATO waiting until December to hold a full leaders-level summit in London.

Pound drops as Brexit disarray drags on,"
LONDON (AFP) - The pound dropped against the dollar and euro on Tuesday as concerns grew that Britain was increasingly likely to crash out of the EU next week without an orderly withdrawal agreement.
A day after British MPs once again rejected a series of alternatives to Prime Minister Theresa MayÃ¢ÂÂs divorce deal, the EUÃ¢ÂÂs chief negotiator Michel Barnier warned that a ""no-deal"" Brexit is ""day after day more likely"".
French President Emmanuel Macron warned that the EU ""would not be held hostage"" and a lengthy extension of BritainÃ¢ÂÂs April 12 deadline was ""not a certainty"".
""If the United Kingdom is unable three years after the referendum to propose a solution that commands a majority, it will have chosen de facto for itself to leave without a deal and we are unable to prevent this failure,"" he said.
The pound was down about 0.5 percent versus the dollar in early evening trading.
The fall spurred LondonÃÂ s benchmark FTSE 100 index which features several multinationals who earn vast sums in dollars to surge by more than one percent to a six-month high.
""The Brexit-weakened pound offered support to the UK index, ensuring that it rallied ahead of its European counterparts,"" said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index.
""The only reason that the pound hasnÃÂ t fallen further today is because MPs are pushing to move avoiding a no-deal Brexit into law.""

According to dealers, the American currency also reached to a record peak of Rs 141.10 with an increase of Rs .20 in interbank market.
The economists see this rise due to strict monetary policies of government in order to fulfill the requirements of IMF and due to a fall in Foreign Direct investment (FDI).
Due to recent hike in the price of dollar the masses are expected to take burden of high inflation with increase in the prices of household items.

Talks with IMF enter final stage: Asad Umar,"
ISLAMABAD (APP) Ã¢ÂÂ Finance Minister Asad Umar on Monday said negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had entered the final stage with settlement of almost all the issues related to the signing of an agreement.
Ã¢ÂÂWe are very close to each other and there is no fundamental difference,Ã¢ÂÂ the minister said while talking to media-persons after launching the State Bank of PakistanÃ¢ÂÂs (SBP) Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs) Regulations here.
The minister said there were issues relating to timing and sequence, which had been resolved. Similarly, the main issue of how to reduce current account deficit had also been sorted out. Now there was no issue with unbridgeable differences, he added.
Asad Umar said at present the IMF was engaged in summer meetings with the World Bank and soon after the meetings, its mission would visit Pakistan to finalize the bailout package.
He said the IMF programme usually lasted for three years and it would disburse loan to Pakistan in three tranches. If the IMF sanctioned $6 billion package, Pakistan would get $2 billion during the current year and in case $9 billion, it would receive $3 billion as first tranche.
He, however, said the IMFÃ¢ÂÂs loan amount would not matter. It was important that after the agreement, the worldÃ¢ÂÂs trust in Pakistan would be restored and it would be able to get more funds from the international bond market, he added.
With respect to aid from the friendly countries, the minister said Saudi Arabia had released its total pledged amount of $3 billion, China had transferred $2.1 billion, and the United Arab Emirates had also remitted $2 billion out of total committed amount of $3 billion.
China, he said, had also pledged to import goods worth $1 billion from Pakistan. All the formalities in that regard had already been finalized and the process to dispatch goods to China would begin during the current month, he added.
To a question regarding delay in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects, the minister said work on all the pending projects, including the multi-billion rupees ML-1 railway track, would start soon.
Asad Umar said shortfall in tax revenues during the current fiscal year was mainly due to the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs efforts to curtail the current account deficit which resulted in significant decline in imports. About 40 percent revenue was generated from the imports.
With regard to increase in petroleum prices, he said the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) had recommended increase in the petrol price by over Rs 11 per liter. However, the government allowed around Rs 6 per liter increase by slashing the tax rate, he added.
The minister attributed the increase in the prices of petroleum products to the rise in the international market along with devaluation of Pak rupee.
Increase in the inflation rate was mainly due to the fact that the government had to take harsh measures to improve the economy, which was on the brink of bankruptcy, he added.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-02-19/news_big_images/485057_25586783.jpg,business,"To a question regarding delay in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects, the minister said work on all the pending projects, including the multi-billion rupees ML-1 railway track, would start soon.",positive

KARACHI (Dunya News) Ã¢ÂÂ The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Monday held the launching ceremony of regulations of Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs) in Islamabad. Federal Minister for Finance, Revenue and Economic Affairs, Asad Umar was the chief guest.

He acknowledged the commitment and full support of the stakeholders who provided extensive and valuable feedback by thoroughly reviewing the draft.
Ahmad recalled that SBP had issued the regulations for branchless banking about a decade ago that enabled the entry of telecommunication companies into the arena of banking and payments.
Ã¢ÂÂThe prime objective of Branchless Banking was to enable the delivery of financial services using telco-based agent network,Ã¢ÂÂ he said adding, Ã¢ÂÂOver the past few years, branchless banking providers have evolved well and are now offering financial services to a large segment of our populationÃ¢ÂÂ.

South Korea's burned out millennials choose YouTube over Samsung,"
SEOUL (Reuters) - Yoon Chang-hyunÃ¢ÂÂs parents told him to get his sanity checked when he quit his secure job as a researcher at Samsung Electronics Co in 2015 to start his own YouTube channel.
The 65 million won (44,271 pounds) a year salary - triple South KoreaÃ¢ÂÂs average entry level wage - plus top-notch healthcare and other benefits offered by the worldÃ¢ÂÂs biggest smartphone and memory chip maker was the envy of many college graduates.
But burned out and disillusioned by repeated night shifts, narrowing opportunities for promotion and skyrocketing property prices that have pushed home ownership out of reach, the then 32-year old Yoon gave it all up in favour of an uncertain career as an internet content provider.

Yoon is among a growing wave of South Korean millennials ditching stable white collar jobs, even as unemployment spikes and millions of others still fight to get into the powerful, family-controlled conglomerates known as chaebol.
Some young Koreans are also moving out of city for farming or taking blue collar jobs abroad, shunning their societyÃ¢ÂÂs traditional measures of success - well-paid office work, raising a family and buying an apartment.
Ã¢ÂÂI got asked a lot if I had gone crazy,Ã¢ÂÂ Yoon said. Ã¢ÂÂBut IÃ¢ÂÂd quit again if I go back. My bosses didnÃ¢ÂÂt look happy. They were overworked, lonely...Ã¢ÂÂ
Yoon now runs a YouTube channel about pursuing dream jobs and is supporting himself from his savings.

Samsung Electronics declined to comment for this article.
Chaebols such as Samsung and Hyundai powered South KoreaÃ¢ÂÂs dramatic rise from the ashes of the 1950-53 war into AsiaÃ¢ÂÂs fourth-largest economy in less than a generation. Well-paid, secure jobs provided a gateway to the middle-class for many baby boomers.
But with economic growth stagnating and competition from lower cost producers weighing on wages, even milliennials who graduated from top universities and secured chaebol jobs say they are less inclined to try to fulfil societyÃ¢ÂÂs expectations.
Similar issues among younger workers are being seen globally. However, South KoreaÃ¢ÂÂs strict hierarchical corporate culture and oversupply of college graduates with homogeneous skills make the problem worse, says Ban Ga-woon, a labour market researcher at state-run Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education & Training.

South Koreans had the shortest job tenure among member countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as of 2012, just 6.6 years compared to the average of 9.4 years and 11.5 years in neighbouring Japan.
The same survey also showed barely 55 percent of South Koreans were satisfied with their jobs, the lowest rate in the OECD.
This January, Ã¢ÂÂquitting jobsÃ¢ÂÂ appeared on the nationÃ¢ÂÂs top 10 new year resolution list on major social media sites.

Ã¢ÂÂDONÃ¢ÂÂT TELL THE BOSSÃ¢ÂÂ

Some workers are even going back to school to learn how to do just that.
A small three-classroom campus in southern Seoul, named Ã¢ÂÂSchool of Quitting JobsÃ¢ÂÂ, has attracted over 7,000 attendees since opening in 2016, founder Jang Su-han told Reuters.
The 34-year-old Jang, who himself quit Samsung Electronics in 2015 to launch the school, said it now offers about 50 courses, including classes on how-to-YouTube, manage an identity crisis, and how to brainstorm a Plan B.
The schoolÃ¢ÂÂs rules are displayed at its entrance: Ã¢ÂÂDonÃ¢ÂÂt tell your bosses, say nothing even if you run into a colleague, and never get caught until your graduation.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂThere is strong demand for identity-related courses, as so many of us were too busy with cram schools to seriously think about what we want to do when were teenagers,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.
To be sure, the lure of a prestigious chaebol job remains strong, especially with the country mired in its worst job slump since 2009 and youth joblessness near a record high.
Samsung Electronics is still the most desired workplace for graduates as of 2019, a survey of 1,040 job seekers by Saramin, a job portal, showed in February.
However, many entering the workforce are much less willing to accept the long hours or mandatory drinking sessions synonymous with the countryÃ¢ÂÂs hierarchical, cutthroat corporate life, says Duncan Harrison, country head of London-based recruitment agency Robert Walters Plc.
Ã¢ÂÂThe mindset of people entering the workforce is very different from past generations,Ã¢ÂÂ Harrison said.


YOUTUBER, SPORTS STAR, CLEANER

Among elementary school students, YouTube creator is now the fifth-ranked dream job, behind being a sports star, school teacher, doctor or a chef, a 2018 government poll showed.
Some are choosing a simpler life in the country.
Between 2013 and 2017, South Korea saw a 24 percent increase in the number of households who ditched city life for farming - more than 12,000 in total.
And in the face of dwindling opportunities at home, nearly 5,800 people also went abroad for jobs last year using government-subsidized programmes, more than tripling from 2013, according to government data.
Others left without support or new jobs lined up.
Plant engineer Cho Seung-duk bought one-way tickets to Australia in December with his wife and two kids.
Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt think my son could get jobs like mine in South Korea,Ã¢ÂÂ said 37 year-old Cho, who moved from Hyundai Engineering & Construction to another top construction firm in 2015 before he emigrated.

"Power-hitting a concern for Pakistan, says Mickey Arthur","
LAHORE (Agencies) - Mickey Arthur, the Pakistan coach, has cited one area of concern for Pakistan at the ICC MenÃ¢ÂÂs Cricket World Cup 2019: the lack of power-hitting.
Pakistan were blanked 5-0 against Australia in the United Arab Emirates, and despite a couple of individual performances, their batting was by and large found wanting. When batting first, they failed to press home the advantage, and when chasing, they struggled to take it down to the wire, even losing by 80 runs in the decisive third one-day international.
There were plenty of centuries Ã¢ÂÂ two each from Haris Sohail and Mohammad Rizwan, and one from Abid Ali Ã¢ÂÂ but as filled as they were with strokes, there was no muscle and power. Arthur was left longing for that.
Ã¢ÂÂThatÃÂ s one of our areas of concern,"" said Arthur. Ã¢ÂÂWe have to make sure that we get our guys to bat in those positions as best as they can. ThatÃÂ s the reason we used Faheem Ashraf in two games. He has done hell of a work in that regard and we wanted to give him more batting time. We have worked really hard with Imad Wasim in that role.
Ã¢ÂÂHasan [Ali] can hit the ball long distances. Shadab [Khan] has worked extremely hard on that aspect of his game. Shoaib Malik and Mohammad Hafeez have worked consistently on their power-hitting. But it is an area that is a worry, and we have to work extremely hard to rectify it.Ã¢ÂÂ
The series was a test of PakistanÃ¢ÂÂs bench strength, and despite the loss, it did throw up some interesting talking points ahead of the World Cup, fitness being the top-most among them.
Ã¢ÂÂIÃÂ ve already asked our skill coaches to give me what they think is necessary for our players. That might be working on death bowling, on variations or bowling slower balls,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂPower-hitting is the one on which we need to work constantly. IÃÂ ve asked the skill coaches to give me those plans and we will start implementing in the next couple of days.
""Plus, we need our players to have optimum fitness levels. We saw the difference in the field between our normal players, the guys with whom weÃÂ ve worked for two years, and the players who have just came to our system. The gap is massive, we canÃÂ t have that happen ever again.Ã¢ÂÂ
PakistanÃ¢ÂÂs preparations for the World Cup arenÃ¢ÂÂt done yet. They head to England later this month, where they will play a solitary Twenty20 International and five ODIs. Arthur said this would be the Ã¢ÂÂbest-prepared squad thatÃ¢ÂÂs ever left PakistanÃ¢ÂÂ for the World Cup.

New Zealand name experienced World Cup squad,"
WELLINGTON (AFP) - New Zealand opted for experience in a 15-man squad named Wednesday for this yearÃÂ s cricket World Cup, with rookie Tom BlundellÃÂ s inclusion as back-up wicketkeeper the only real surprise.
The Blacks Caps hope to shed their tag as valiant losers and claim the title after exiting in the semi-finals six times and suffering a heavy defeat to Australia in their only appearance in the final four years ago.
Coach Gary Stead said the Kane Williamson-led Black Caps had repeatedly proved itself at the top level and he was confident the consistency would shine through at the tournament in England and Wales.
""WeÃÂ ve got a squad here of 15 players that we think can give us a really, really good chance of going far into the tournament,"" he said.
""If we play close to our potential, then hopefully we can do New Zealand proud.""
Wellington keeper Blundell was selected after Tim Siefert, the regular back-up to first-choice gloveman Tom Latham, broke his finger in a domestic match last month.
While Blundell, who has two Test caps, will likely make his one-day international debut at the tournament, his role will be marginal if Latham stays fit.
Mitchell Santner will be the New ZealanderÃÂ s primary spinner, with Ish Sodhi edging Todd Astle to claim the second slow bowling position.
The pace attack comprises Tim Southee, Trent Boult, Lockie Ferguson and Matt Henry, while Jimmy Neesham and Colin de Grandhomme add allround options.
Henry Nicholls is set to open the batting with veteran Martin Guptill after displacing Colin Munro at the top of the order, although Munro will make the trip as batting cover.
Williamson and Ross Taylor, in his fourth World Cup campaign, complete a battle-hardened batting line up.
Williamson, Taylor and Guptill have collectively amassed 526 ODI appearances between them.
Guptill and Taylor have not confirmed their post-tournament plans but will most likely be looking to exit cricketÃÂ s biggest stage on a high.
The Black Caps will open their campaign against Sri Lanka in Cardiff on June 1.

'I just want to prove it to myself' Ã¢ÂÂ Jason Roy opens up on Test ambitions,"
LONDON (Agencies) - Could EnglandÃÂ s ODI opener Jason Roy be the answer to their top-order struggles in Test cricket? His list of achievements in white-ball cricket is long, and growing by the day. He holds the record for EnglandÃ¢ÂÂs highest ODI score Ã¢ÂÂ 180 v Australia Ã¢ÂÂ and has shared in their highest ODI partnership, an unbeaten 256 with Alex Hales v Sri Lanka in 2016.
He has opened for England in ODIs more often than anyone else since the last MenÃ¢ÂÂs Cricket World Cup, and no one has played more than his 73 ODIs for England without playing at least one Test match.
Following the retirement of Sir Alastair Cook, and with England having struggled even before his departure to find suitable candidates at the top of the order. Since Andrew Strauss retired in 2012, they have tried 13 men in the position. None have lasted more than 20 Tests in the role, or made more than 1,000 runs from the top two.
With the Ashes approaching, RoyÃÂ s name has floated towards the top of many peopleÃ¢ÂÂs lists, searching for someone comfortable in the international arena and setting the tone of a contest. His first-class record, averaging 46.45 since the start of 2014, also marks him out as a Test candidate. HeÃ¢ÂÂs feeling comfortable with the attention.
Ã¢ÂÂThere are people that want me to play, people that donÃ¢ÂÂt want me to play,Ã¢ÂÂ Roy said to Sky Sports. Ã¢ÂÂI just want to play to prove it to myself really. To see where IÃ¢ÂÂm at and to see if I can actually do it. You never know what is going to happen but I just want to put the right stepping stones in and make sure that IÃÂ m selected, that is the first process.Ã¢ÂÂ
One man who knows more opening in Test cricket and Jason Roy than most is former England opener and Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart, who has emphatically backed his chargeÃ¢ÂÂs Test chances.
Ã¢ÂÂHe is someone who wants to play Test cricket,Ã¢ÂÂ Stewart told Sky Sports. Ã¢ÂÂHe is such a talent that I believe can play all forms of the game. I said two years ago that he is good enough to play Test match cricket. He has to have a good World Cup and if he does that, I reckon his name will be near enough at the top of the list to play in that Ashes series.Ã¢ÂÂ
Roy has rarely opened in first-class cricket, but Stewart thinks his experience in ODIs should stand him in good stead.
Ã¢ÂÂJason is opening in one-day international cricket. Twenty20 and Test cricket are miles apart, but in the first 10 or 15 overs of 50-over cricket you still have to respect that new ball,Ã¢ÂÂ he told BT Sport. Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt see it as a big issue for him and heÃ¢ÂÂd cope with the stepping stone up to Test cricket.
Ã¢ÂÂThe Australia attack is a challenging attack, but JasonÃ¢ÂÂs method is a solid one. HeÃ¢ÂÂs a good stroke player and a good hitter of the ball, but he can defend well too, which you have to be able to do.Ã¢ÂÂ

DUBAI (Web Desk) Ã¢ÂÂ Pakistan all-rounder Imad Wasim has made huge gains in the MRF Tyres ICC MenÃ¢ÂÂs ODI Player Rankings after scoring 141 runs in the series against Australia and taking three wickets.
The left-hander, who led his side in the last two matches after Shoaib Malik had to withdraw due to an injury, has gained 16 places to reach 68th among batsmen, advanced seven places to reach 37th in the list of bowlers and moved from 16th to joint-sixth among all-rounders along with West Indies captain Jason Holder.

Australia captain Aaron Finch has moved into the top 10 of the ODI rankings after a superb run in the series against Pakistan which his side won 5-0 to bolster its confidence just two months before the ICC MenÃ¢ÂÂs Cricket World Cup 2019.
The 32-year-oldÃ¢ÂÂs player of the series effort of 451 runs, with two centuries and at an average of 112.75, has seen him gain 12 slots to reach joint-ninth position, even as his other team-mates too made important gains in the list of batsmen with memorable efforts in the five-match series in the United Arab Emirates.
FinchÃ¢ÂÂs opening partner Usman Khawaja has gained six slots to reach 19th position after scoring 272 runs in the series while Glenn Maxwell has advanced 10 places to reach 23rd place with 258 runs. Shaun Marsh has gained three slots to reach 44th after an aggregate of 182 runs.

There has been no change of positions in the MRF Tyres ICC MenÃ¢ÂÂs ODI Team Rankings but Australia have increased the gap over Pakistan from one to 11 points.

Cooley's Ashes job to be a hit-and-run affair,"
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia bowling coach Troy Cooley has no plans to carry on the role full-time after this yearÃ¢ÂÂs Ashes series and expects to head back to his usual job at the national cricket academy after plotting EnglandÃ¢ÂÂs downfall.
Cooley, who helped England win back the urn in the memorable 2005 series, left his post as head bowling coach at the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane to join the Australian camp for the recent one-day series against Pakistan and India.
Although announced as bowling coach for the Ashes last week, Cooley confirmed he would be in the role for a good time, not a long time.
Ã¢ÂÂAshes, it gets me out of bed in the morning,Ã¢ÂÂ the 53-year-old said in Dubai, where Australia completed a 5-0 whitewash of Pakistan on Sunday.
Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs one of the best jobs going around.
Ã¢ÂÂYou could not pass up an opportunity like this.
Ã¢ÂÂBut I would probably be more inclined to continue the (NCC) head coaching role.Ã¢ÂÂ
Cooley replaced David Saker, AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs last full-time bowling coach, for the India and Pakistan ODI series, but governing body Cricket Australia have yet to decide on a long-term appointment.
As one of the principal architects of EnglandÃ¢ÂÂs droughtbreaking 2-1 series win in 2005, CooleyÃ¢ÂÂs involvement is a boost for an Australian team hoping to claim the urn on English soil for the first time since 2001.
He said reverse swing might not have as much of an impact on the series as it had in 2005 because of stadium upgrades.
Ã¢ÂÂIt really depends on Mother Nature,Ã¢ÂÂ Cooley said.
Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂll exploit that if we get an opportunity to, depending on the conditions.
Ã¢ÂÂBut a lot of English grounds now have got irrigation and been redone, so you donÃ¢ÂÂt have those real dry outfields like in Ã¢ÂÂ05.Ã¢ÂÂ
Even with first choice quicks Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood currently injured, Australia are unlikely to be short of quality pacemen.
Cooley said AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs whole attack would need to be versatile to have success in England when the series gets underway in August.
Ã¢ÂÂThe fast bowlers and the spinners have got to work as a team and I know Ã¢ÂÂJLÃ¢ÂÂ (head coach Justin Langer) is really keen to make sure that pack mentality is tight and theyÃ¢ÂÂre covering all bases,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

Man Utd director Sawhney takes charge as new world cricket chief,"
NEW DELHI (AFP) - Indian-born media executive Manu Sawhney has taken over as chief executive of the International Cricket Council, the world body said Monday as it started a new era aiming to boost the sportÃÂ s television revenues and profile.
Sawhney, who has been managing director of broadcaster ESPN Star Sports and is a non-executive director of football giants Manchester United, succeeds former South African Test wicketkeeper Dave Richardson.
Sawhney has been preparing for the transition alongside Richardson at the ICCÃÂ s Dubai headquarters for the past six weeks as cricket becomes the latest in a series of sports to turn to a business executive to lead its operations.
Star Sports has in recent years become one of the key international cricket broadcasters.

Richardson joined the ICC as general manager of cricket operations, and was promoted to chief executive in 2012 after South African Haroon Lorgat quit.
""I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at the ICC and I am pleased with what we have achieved in recent times particularly in creating greater context for all formats of the game,"" said Richardson.

It takes so much dedication and determination to consistently perform at the highest level in Test cricket.

Finch sounds World Cup warning as Australia confidence rockets,"
DUBAI (AFP) - Captain Aaron Finch warned Australia will embark on their World Cup defence next month with confidence riding high after completing an ODI sweep against Pakistan on Sunday hot on the heels of a series victory in India.
Written off after a torrid 15 months which saw Australia win just three of 18 one-day internationals, Finch led the 2015 World Cup winners from 2-0 down last month to beat Virat KohliÃ¢ÂÂs formidable side 3-2, AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs first series win in India since 2009.
They then romped to a 5-0 rout of a depleted Pakistan who rested six top players for the series played in the United Arab Emirates, including regular captain Sarfraz Ahmed, ahead of the World Cup which begins on May 30.
""WeÃ¢ÂÂll go to the World Cup with a lot of confidence now, even after a lot of people wrote us off,"" said Finch who was declared man of the series for his 451 runs including two hundreds and two fifties.
""Potentially we had a real focus coming here and that was our last hit-out before the World Cup so we wanted to go into that tournament with a lot of momentum,"" he said after inflicting a fourth whitewash on Pakistan in a bilateral series.
Winners of 2015 World Cup at home, Australia had endured a miserable time in limited-overs cricket since last yearÃ¢ÂÂs ball-tampering controversy in South Africa.
The scandal resulted in former captain and vice-captain Steve Smith and David Warner being banned for a year, suspensions that expired only last week, and Australia were then routed 5-0 in England and dropped home series 2-1 to both South Africa and India.

Tough selection calls

Finch admitted the potential return of Warner, who has been in top form in the Indian Premier League, and Smith would mean some difficult choices when the World Cup squad is named later this month.
""There will be some unlucky guys,"" said Finch of squad that could also see the return of fast bowlers Mitchell Starc, Jos Hazlewood and Pat Cummins after injury.
""Everyone who has an opportunity has played some great cricket. At the end of the day there will be some tough calls, but its exciting for Australia at the same time because six month back a lot of people were slamming us.
""A lot of people were writing us off, not in just the one-day cricket but in all forms of the game. ItÃ¢ÂÂs been really positive last couple of months and we have been building nicely.""
PakistanÃ¢ÂÂs head coach Mickey Arthur, who has also coached South Africa and Australia, said the defending champions were in good shape.
""All the final jigsaw pieces are coming together nicely. Australia look a very, very good side. They will be a threat at the World Cup,"" said Arthur.
Arthur defended leaving out key players Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Hasan Ali, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Sarfraz, while Mohammad Hafeez was missing injured.
""All we can do is prepare as best we can,"" he said. ""We got on the road in September last year for the Asia Cup and then went to South Africa and then had the Pakistan Super League so we had to rest them.""ÃÂ ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-01-19/news_big_images/484875_83669314.jpg,Cricket,"Tough selection calls

In-form Aussies give Langer 'brutal' World Cup selection dilemma,"
SYDNEY (AFP) - Australia coach Justin Langer Monday admitted some players will be ""brutally unlucky"" as he faces a World Cup selection dilemma with the return of Steve Smith and David Warner.
The defending champions must name their 15-man squad this month for the tournament in England and Wales and Langer said the make-up was becoming clear on the back of the resurgent teamÃ¢ÂÂs stunning eight-game one-day win streak against India and Pakistan.
""ItÃ¢ÂÂs actually becoming more obvious by the day to me. The same with the other selectors,"" he said on the Cricket Australia website.
""We know categorically there are going to be one or two guys brutally unlucky not to get selected because theyÃ¢ÂÂre all going so well... the blokes in the squad at the moment will be praying itÃ¢ÂÂs not them.""
Australia made it eight in a row with a 20-run win in the fifth and final one-dayer against Pakistan in Dubai on Sunday to sweep the series 5-0 after coming from behind to beat India 3-2 last month.
Their red-hot form has been built on the back of a rock-solid opening partnership between skipper Aaron Finch and Usman Khawaja.
Shaun Marsh, Peter Handscomb and Glenn Maxwell have also been in fine touch with the bat, leaving difficult decisions as to where Warner and Smith will fit back in after serving their one-year bans for their part in a ball-tampering scandal.
The bombastic Warner seems a certain starter for their World Cup opener against Afghanistan in Bristol on June 1 after his blistering return to the Indian Premier League.
He bludgeoned a century in 55 balls on Sunday after smashing 85 and 69 in his first two outings for Sunrisers Hyderabad last week.
Former captain Smith, who has scored more modestly with 20 and 28 for the Rajasthan Royals so far, is also expected to be recalled by Australia.ÃÂ 

Ã¢ÂÂGood problemÃ¢ÂÂ to have

Langer said having Warner banging down the door to open the batting -- a position he has occupied in all but one of his 104 ODI innings -- was a ""good problem"" to have.
""Aaron has had a really good partnership with David Warner as well,"" he said, while pointing to the current partnership between Finch and Khawaja as ""blossoming at the moment"".
""They (Finch and Khawaja) are both pretty chilled out and I think they work really well together. I think itÃ¢ÂÂs a positive thing.
David has shown heÃ¢ÂÂs a very versatile player, UzzieÃ¢ÂÂs batted three a number of times, FinchyÃ¢ÂÂs batted in the middle order. VersatilityÃ¢ÂÂs important,"" he added.
AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs selectors also face a bowling conundrum as they target a record sixth World Cup triumph.
Pat Cummins is a certain starter but Mitchell Starc, the 2015 World Cup player of the tournament, and Josh Hazlewood, who was also integral to their successful campaign at home four years ago, have both been struggling with injury.
They missed the recent winning run and in their absence Jhye Richardson, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Jason Behrendorff and Kane Richardson all played well.
""ThereÃ¢ÂÂs actually some good depth of talent now,"" said Langer. ""ThereÃ¢ÂÂs a number of guys who we could easily select... weÃ¢ÂÂve got some more confidence in the other guys.""
Australia are expected to take two spinners, with Adam Zampa starting to work well in tandem with Nathan Lyon and conditions expected to be similar to the United Arab Emirates.
Marcus Stoinis had a quiet series with bat and ball against Pakistan but is expected to be named as the all-rounder because Mitch Marsh is out of favour.ÃÂ ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-01-19/news_big_images/484872_34501816.jpg,Cricket,The defending champions must name their 15-man squad this month for the tournament in England and Wales and Langer said the make-up was becoming clear on the back of the resurgent teamÂs stunning eight-game one-day win streak against India and Pakistan.,negative
Grief-stricken New Zealand postpone U-19 tour to Bangladesh,"
DHAKA (AFP) - Grief-stricken New Zealand have postponed a tour of their youth cricket team to Bangladesh, saying they were still in a ""state of shock"" following the Christchurch mosque attacks earlier this month, an official said on Sunday.
The New Zealand Under-19 cricket team was scheduled to arrive in Dhaka on April 10 to play five youth one-day international matches against their Bangladeshi counterparts.
But the Bangladesh Cricket Board chief executive officer Nizamuddin Chowdhury said the tour has now been postponed as the Kiwis have yet to recover fully from the shock of the racist massacre that left 50 Muslims dead.
""We have been recently communicated by the New Zealand cricket authorities that they are unable to send the youth team to Bangladesh as the country is still in a state of shock,"" he said.
""The series has now been postponed. It will be held at a later date,"" he said.
BangladeshÃÂ s Test cricket team which was on tour in New Zealand narrowly escaped the March 15 attacks.
At least 17 members of the team drove up to ChristchurchÃÂ s Al Noor mosque in a bus to join Friday prayers when a white supremacist gunman stormed the building, in what is thought to be the worst act of terror directed against Muslims in the West.
They later watched as blood-soaked victims staggered from the building, according to team manager Khaled Mashud, who said if they had arrived just a few minutes later the team could have been caught up in the massacre.
The team was in Christchurch for their third and final Test match against the home side scheduled to begin the next day, which was promptly cancelled to allow the cricketers to return home at the earliest possible time.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-01-19/news_big_images/484845_24687439.jpg,Cricket,"

After the torture case surfaced, new revelations opened up a new debate between those who justify her husbandÃ¢ÂÂs act of shaving her head and torturing her for refusing to dance in front of his friends because of her dance video.
They feel that the husband need not to be blamed, as Asma was accustomed to dancing in parties, referring to her viral dance video.
Sanam Saeed, the famous actress has spoken up in favour of the victim, saying that her video doesnÃ¢ÂÂt justify the criminal act.

Streaming helps boost 2018 music industry sales,"
LONDON (AFP) - Worldwide music sales rose by nearly 10 percent in 2018, a fourth consecutive year of growth fuelled by online streaming, according to figures released on Tuesday by an industry body.
Revenues reached $19.1 billion last year, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which represents the recorded music industry worldwide, said in its Global Music Report 2019.
""We are now much more optimistic,"" said IFPI chief executive Frances Moore, describing the period prior to recent growth as a ""mourn-fest"" when ""we only had bad years"".
However, the overall growth of 9.7 percent in sales masks a discrepancy within the industry, with streaming buoyant -- accounting for almost half of revenues -- while downloads and physical purchases continued to drop.
The streaming sector, which includes subscription fees and advertising income, grew by 34 percent to reach $8.9 billion in 2018.
There were 255 million users of paid streaming services at the end of year, according to the report.
But paid downloads fell by 21.2 percent and physical sales of music were down by 10.1 percent.
Despite the growing presence of paid streaming services, piracy remains a problem with an estimated 120 million online users illegally ripping music from streams each month, Moore said.
""They are hacking and downloading the music... at the price of the stream, and very often they are not paying at all,"" he said.
""And whole discographies can be downloaded with bittorrent and other forms,"" Moore added.
Marked regional disparities exist within the positive global growth picture.
For a second year running, Latin America saw the largest increase, with total sales up 16.8 percent.
In North America, where the transition from physical to digital music formats is well advanced, sales also jumped, by 14 percent last year.
However, in Europe sales rose a miniscule 0.1 percent.
Meanwhile, the IFPIÃ¢ÂÂs annual singles chart saw rising Cuban-American star Camila Cabello, Canadian rapper Drake and Briton Ed Sheeran top of the pile.
In the album rankings, the soundtrack of smash hit musical movie ""The Greatest Showman"", South Korean boyband BTS and US star Lady Gaga were the biggest sellers.
Vinyl, an increasingly popular format for audiophiles and nostalgic listeners, also saw sales grow for the 13th consecutive year.
It now represents 3.6 percent of the industryÃ¢ÂÂs total turnover.   ÃÂ ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-03-19/news_big_images/485204_58040333.jpg,entertainment,"

Pop singer Nazia Hassan's 54th birth anniversary being celebrated today,"
(Dunya News) Ã¢ÂÂ Regarded as the original pop diva of the sub continent, late Nazia Hassan is being remembered on her 54th birthday by her fans in Pakistan and abroad.
Pop queen Nazia Hassan was born on April 3rd 1965 and debuted into the massive music industry of the subcontinent by introducing the disco genre with her Aap Jaisa Koi song for Feroz KhanÃ¢ÂÂs film Qurbani.
Aap Jaisa Koi was a massive hit that led to the trio Nazia Hassan, her brother Zoheb Hassan and London-based music director Biddu collaborating for their very first album Disco Deewane which was another massive hit and had topped the charts home, India and abroad.
The iconic Disco Deewane that became youthÃ¢ÂÂs anthem at the time was so ahead of its time that it was borrowed in Karan JoharÃ¢ÂÂs 2012 film Student Of The Year.
Nazia and Zoheb went on to release four more albums namely Star, Young Tarang, Hotline and Camera Camera.
The pop icon decided to quit singing in order to pursue philanthropy, a reason why her final album was dedicated to the battle against narcotics cause.
Nazia went on to earn her LLB degree from University of Lancaster and took a job as Political Analyst at the United Nations headquarters in New York where she concentrated her research on disputed areas especially the Palestinian territories and Kashmir.
She was diagnosed with cancer and went through several chemotherapy sessions. Just when it looked as though she had beaten the cancer, her health deteriorated and she was admitted to the hospital again where she breathed her last on August 13, 2000.
Nazia Hassan earned several awards and honours in her short yet glorious career including a Filmfare award and Golden Disk Award. She was also awarded the highest civil award Pride of Performance posthumously.ÃÂ

Mick Jagger to undergo heart surgery: report,"

The iconic British band had announced Saturday it was delaying the ""No Filter"" tour for the 75-year-old rocker to receive an unspecified medical treatment.
Leading industry magazine Rolling Stone reported on Monday the cause was heart valve surgery, following an earlier report from Drudge Report, which added the procedure would take place this Friday in New York.

Grammy-nominated US rapper Nipsey Hussle shot dead: reports,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - Grammy-nominated rapper Nipsey Hussle was shot dead in the US city of Los Angeles on Sunday, US media reported.
A Los Angeles police department spokesman could not confirm the deceased victimÃ¢ÂÂs name, but told AFP that a shooting on Sunday afternoon had killed one person and wounded two others.
The shooter is still at large, the spokesman said.
Just hours earlier, Hussle -- a 33-year-old whose youth was intertwined with Los Angeles gang culture -- tweeted: ""Having strong enemies is a blessing.""
The rapper was mourned by big names in the music industry.
""Gone 2 soon,"" rapper Snoop Dogg posted on Instagram. ""IÃ¢ÂÂm so sad right now IÃ¢ÂÂll just reflect on the good times we had.""

"Disney's 'Dumbo' soars, sort of, to top N.American ticket sales","
LOS ANGELES (AFP) - DisneyÃÂ s new live-action film ""Dumbo"" took flight over the weekend but didnÃÂ t quite make the expected altitude, taking in an estimated $45 million in North American theaters, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations reported Sunday.
Analysts expected the movie, Tim BurtonÃÂ s live-action remake of the 1941 classic about a small elephant with huge and magical ears, to take in at least $50 million in its opening three-day weekend, according to Variety. The film had a $170 million production budget.
With a cast including Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Eva Green and Danny DeVito, ""Dumbo"" may yet catch on overseas, where it has taken in $71 million. The last Burton/Disney live-action  collaboration, ""Alice in Wonderland,"" earned $1.02 billion worldwide.
""Dumbo"" pushed last weekendÃÂ s box office leader, ""Us,"" down to second place but the Universal horror film still brought in a respectable $33.6 million. Written and directed by Jordan Peele, ""Us"" stars Lupita NyongÃÂ o and Winston Duke as a couple frighteningly confronted by their doppelgangers.
In third spot was another Disney film, ""Captain Marvel,"" which had North American ticket sales of $20.5 million, pushing its cumulative worldwide total to just under $1 billion. Oscar winner Brie Larson stars as a former fighter pilot with superpowers.
LionsgateÃÂ s ""Five Feet Apart,"" featuring Haley Lu Richardson and Cole Sprouse as a pair of enamored teens who must keep their distance as they deal with cystic fibrosis, came in fourth at $6.3 million.
Fifth place went to new release ""Unplanned"" from Christian production company Pure Flix, at $6.1 million -- a shade over its $6 million production budget. Ashley Bratcher stars in the true story of a young Planned Parenthood employee who becomes an anti-abortion activist.

Play charts epic rise and fall of Lehman Brothers,"
NEW YORK (AFP) - For one month only, the original Lehman Brothers have returned to New York City, and they have lots to say about the virtues and vices of American capitalism.
Henry, Emanuel and Mayer Lehman are at the center of ""The Lehman Trilogy,"" a play that chronicles how a trio of Jewish immigrant brothers from Germany and their sons grew Lehman Brothers from a tiny cotton broker in Alabama into global financial juggernaut.
The firm survived the Civil War, the 1929 stock market crash and other crises before imploding spectacularly in 2008 to spark the global financial crisis.
The play, which debuted in Paris in 2013 and has played in various incarnations throughout Europe, made its US premiere this week at the Park Avenue Armory in a production originally presented at the National Theatre in London.
The venue is only blocks away from where Mayer and Emanuel lived and walkable from the firmÃ¢ÂÂs midtown headquarters when it went under.
The Oscar- and Tony-winning director Sam Mendes, who was living in New York in 2008, made tweaks in light of the audience.
""In London, it felt slightly broader and more comic and here it is still full of mischief and wit,"" Mendes said in a panel discussion at the Armory.
""But it feels weÃ¢ÂÂre closer to the bone here, and that means you have to take it a little bit more seriously and you need to be careful how you articulate things.""

Three-man show

In a twist, the English-language adaptation features just three actors who take on the personas of the brothers and also play their sons, clients, rivals and wives in the more than three-hour show.
The brothers did business by the handshake and were driven by an abstract hope to make a better life, rather than ""rows and rows of zeroes,"" as EmanuelÃ¢ÂÂs son, Philip Lehman, says at one point.
The continual presence of Henry, Emanuel and Mayer ""holds 1844 all the time... even as the story moves through to 2008,"" said Ben Power, who adapted the script from a 400-page text by Italian playwright and author Stefano Massini.
Versions of the play have run as long as 10 hours with much bigger casts, said Power, who sees a logic in the interest among Europeans in Lehman.
""ItÃ¢ÂÂs a story about European immigrants coming to this country and building something,"" Power said. ""Sometimes it takes an outsider to show you yourself.""

Ã¢ÂÂMerchants of moneyÃ¢ÂÂ

The Lehman saga begins with the arrival in New York in 1844 of the eldest brother Hayum Lehmann, whose name is quickly changed to Henry Lehman before he moves to Montgomery Alabama and opens a general store.
Following the arrival of the younger brothers, they establish ""Lehman Brothers"" in 1850, which evolves into a cotton broker, a business that grows dramatically after Emanuel relocates to New York and markets the commodity to clothing manufacturers.
The firm moves into other commodities and then goes on to finance the national railroad system and the Panama Canal. Its funds also help propel new industries, including air travel, department stores and entertainment, financing the studio that made ""King Kong"" and ""Gone with the Wind.""
Throughout, the Lehman men demonstrate a knack for sussing out an unfilled or unarticulated need that they quickly meet in ways that both anticipate and create the future.
Their efforts help make the United States a superpower, but as the sons of the founders emerge -- American-born men with more distance from the familyÃ¢ÂÂs old-world graciousness and religious faith -- they push the business in new and riskier directions.
""We are merchants of money,"" Philip Lehman tells his father and uncle Mayer as he is seizing control of the company. ""We use money to make more money.""
Reckless speculation creates a bubble that ends with the 1929 crash -- an event that portends 2008 and which is marked in the play with the chilling accounts of young stock brokers who jumped off buildings or shot themselves in the head.
In another fateful moment, PhilipÃ¢ÂÂs son Bobbie, the last family member to lead the bank, hires Lewis Glucksman in 1965 to establish a trading division that is housed separately from LehmanÃ¢ÂÂs headquarters.
""I do the dirty work down in the gutter,"" Glucksman tells Bobbie Lehman. ""A trading division will make you millions in a day, but you wonÃ¢ÂÂt be able to show it off in your living room.""
Bobbie later visits GlucksmanÃ¢ÂÂs operation with Paul Mazur, an elderly Lehman partner who serves as a kind of stand-in for the original brothers and is horrified and terrified by what he sees.
""The play tries to chart the way that human beings lose control of the things they create,"" Power said.
""There was a nobility at the beginning. These structures were created in part to make money, but in part to do good,"" Power said. ""It went disastrously wrong and weÃ¢ÂÂre still living with the consequences.""",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/March/03-31-19/news_big_images/484769_17976178.jpg,entertainment,"""ItÂs a story about European immigrants coming to this country and building something,"" Power said.",positive

First woman to win 'Afghan Star' TV show to fight Taliban with music,"
KABUL (AFP) - The first woman to win the Afghan version of American Idol says she will fight the Taliban with her music, embracing a victory rich in symbolism as her country faces an uncertain future.
Zahra Elham won the 14th edition of Afghan Star last week, after male contestants took the prize in the hugely popular televised singing competition 13 years in a row.
Elham, from AfghanistanÃ¢ÂÂs ethnic Hazara minority, enchanted audiences with her high-pitched, raspy voice, performing Hazara and Persian folk music in traditional loose, colourful Afghan dresses and heels.
The result made international headlines at a time when many women in the deeply patriarchal country fear their hard-won rights may come under threat as Washington, seeking a way out of the war, holds talks with the Taliban.
Elham, who spoke to AFP in an interview at private television channel Tolo, which produces Afghan Star, appeared taken aback by her new fame more than a week on -- but determined to use it to inspire other girls.
""I was very proud of myself but at the same time shocked to be the first woman to win the contest,"" the young woman in her early 20s said, her hair elegantly covered with an olive green scarf, visibly still uncomfortable with a camera.
No one sings in her family, she said. She was inspired to compete after watching YouTube videos of idols such as Aryana Sayeed, an Afghan pop singer and social media star often likened to Kim Kardashian -- a characterisation that in conservative Afghanistan is a bold, deeply political one.
When asked if she, like Sayeed, is now a role model for AfghanistanÃ¢ÂÂs young women, ElhamÃ¢ÂÂs response underscored the importance of her new platform in a country where women are largely absent from public spaces.
""Yes, my voice is important for the women of Afghanistan,"" she replied bluntly.
""Other girls will get courage and sing, like I have been following Aryana Sayeed ... when I saw a girl like Aryana Sayeed I thought to myself, Ã¢ÂÂIf she can, so can I. She has two hands and two legs, as do IÃ¢ÂÂ.""

Ã¢ÂÂMake my future brightÃ¢ÂÂÃÂ 


Despite her passion, Elham, who is also a Justin Bieber and Maher Zain fan, says she has no intention of going in to politics.
But if the Taliban return to some semblance of power in Afghanistan, she says, ""I will fight with my music, because I want to make my life music and singing"".
The Taliban used their strict interpretation of Islam to ban music and force women behind closed doors and beneath burkas during their austere rule of Afghanistan from 1996 until they were ousted in 2001.
Since then they have waged an increasingly bloody insurgency against the Afghan government and US-led international troops.
Now, as talks with the US progress, fears are sharp in Kabul that Washington may rush to exit, paving the way for the Taliban to return to some semblance of power in Afghanistan.
Young women, keenly aware of how their gender were suppressed under Taliban rule -- and still facing steep restrictions in Afghanistan today -- are among the most vocal in warning they will not compromise their rights if the insurgents return.
For now, however, Elham says her victory is a matter of pride -- and that she remains focused on her music, with plans to learn the guitar and make more video clips of herself performing.
""I see my future in music, and I can make my future bright with singing,"" she says.ÃÂ ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/March/03-30-19/news_big_images/484696_34272527.jpg,entertainment,"

Japan Display to supply OLED screens for Apple Watch,"
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Display Inc will begin to supply organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens for the Apple Watch later this year, two sources said, a breakthrough for the cash-strapped company whose late shift to OLED has cost it orders from Apple.
The supply deal would mark Japan DisplayÃ¢ÂÂs foray into the OLED display market, the two sources familiar with the matter said, declining to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media.
A spokesman for Japan Display said he could not comment on specific customers.
Japan DisplayÃ¢ÂÂs mainstay liquid crystal display (LCD) business has been slumping due to Apple IncÃ¢ÂÂs recent shift away from LCD, and disappointing sales of the iPhone XR, the only LCD model in AppleÃ¢ÂÂs 2018 line-up.
The OLED display market is dominated by Samsung Electronics unit Samsung Display and LG Display, with Chinese players quickly catching up. OLED displays are generally thinner and allow more flexibility than LCD screens.
Samsung Display is currently the exclusive supplier of OLED panels for iPhones, while LG Display provides a majority of panels for the Apple Watch.
Hiroshi Hayase, senior director at IHS Markit, said it is a positive step for Japan Display, but added that the company would face a tough road ahead.ÃÂ ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-03-19/news_big_images/485326_47821565.jpg,Technology,"

South Korea to launch world's first national 5G networks,"
SEOUL (AFP) - South Korea launches the worldÃ¢ÂÂs first fully-fledged 5G mobile networks Friday, a transformational leap that already has superpowers sparring for control of an innovation that could potentially change the day-to-day lives of billions of people.
The superfast communications heralded by fifth-generation wireless technology will ultimately underpin everything from toasters to telephones; from electric cars to power grids.
But while the South has won the race to be first to provide the user experience, that is only one part of a wider battle that has pitted the United States against China and ensnared giants including Huawei.
Hyper-wired South Korea has long had a reputation for technical prowess, and Seoul has made the 5G rollout a priority as it seeks to stimulate stuttering economic growth.
The system will bring smartphones near-instantaneous connectivity -- 20 times faster than existing 4G -- allowing users to download entire movies in less than a second.
In the same way that 3G enabled widespread mobile web access and 4G made new applications work ranging from social media to Uber, 5G will herald a new level of connectivity, empowered by speed.
It is crucial for the future development of devices ranging from self-driving vehicles that send data traffic to one another in real time, industrial robots, drones and other elements of the Internet of Things.
That makes it a vital part of the infrastructure of tomorrow, and the 5G standard is expected to bring about $565 billion in global economic benefits by 2034, according to the London-based Global System for Mobile Communications, an industry alliance.
ÃÂ 
Ã¢ÂÂOne million devicesÃ¢ÂÂ
ÃÂ 
ÃÂ 
But the implications have pitted Washington against Beijing in an increasingly bitter standoff.
The US has pressed its allies and major economies to avoid 5G solutions from Chinese-owned telecom giant Huawei, citing security risks that technological backdoors could give Beijing access to 5G-connected utilities and other components.
But Chinese firms dominate 5G technology.
Huawei, the global leader, has registered 1,529 5G patents, according to data analysis firm IPlytics.
Combined with manufacturers ZTE and Oppo, plus the China Academy of Telecommunications Technology, Chinese entities own a total of 3,400 patents, it says -- more than a third of the total.
South Korea comes next, with its companies holding 2,051 patents.
In contrast, US firms have 1,368 altogether, IPlytics said -- 29 fewer than FinlandÃ¢ÂÂs Nokia alone.
All three of South KoreaÃ¢ÂÂs mobile operators go live with their 5G services on Friday.
""5GÃ¢ÂÂs hyper speed can connect one million devices within a one square kilometer zone simultaneously,"" KT said in a report.
Neither KT nor SK Telecom use Huawei technology in their 5G networks, but it is a supplier to LG UPlus, the three companies told AFP.
On the same day, Samsung Electronics will release the Galaxy S10 5G, the worldÃ¢ÂÂs first available smartphone using the technology, and rival phone maker LG follows with the V50s two weeks later.
ÃÂ 
- Cost barrier -
More than three million South Koreans will switch to 5G by the end of this year, predicted KT vice-president Lee Pil-jae.
Until now, no mobile networks have offered nationwide 5G access. In the US, hotspots in a few selected cities have offered 5G speeds but over Wi-Fi only, while Qatari firm Ooredoo says it offers 5G services in and around Doha -- but does not have devices available to use them.
US network carrier Verizon will launch fifth-generation services for mobile users in Chicago and Minneapolis next week, with more than 30 cities due to follow this year.
Japan is also expected to roll out a limited deployment in 2019 before full services start in time for next yearÃ¢ÂÂs Tokyo Olympics.
Cost is likely to be a barrier for user uptake initially, analysts say, as the cheapest version of the new Galaxy handset will be priced at 1.39 million won ($1,200).
""While there are many cheap 4G smartphones under $300, SamsungÃ¢ÂÂs 5G phones are well over $1,000, which could be a major minus point for cost-savvy consumers,"" a KT representative told AFP.
None of South KoreaÃÂ s three network operators would say how much they have invested in 5G -- but SeoulÃÂ s economy minister Hong Nam-ki put it at least $2.6 billion this year alone.
""If 5G is fully implemented,"" he said, ""it will greatly improve peopleÃ¢ÂÂs lives"".

New Gmail feature will let users schedule emails,"
(Web Desk) Ã¢ÂÂ GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs e-mail service Gmail has turned 15 and to celebrate the tech giant has introduced a new feature of scheduling emails for sending them at a particular time.
""Just write your email as you normally would, then schedule it to arrive in your recipientÃ¢ÂÂs inbox at a later date and time,"" Google said in a blog post.
HereÃ¢ÂÂs how to do it:
Firstly, users need to actually wait for the feature to roll out fully which should happen in the coming days. Google said it started rolling out the feature on Monday but it could take up to a couple weeks to reach everyone.
Users do not need to install any software upgrades to get new features in G Suite. Instead, features appear in usersÃ¢ÂÂ accounts automatically.
Once users have received the update, when it comes to hitting send on an e-mail, you will notice that you can click on a little arrow on the right side of the blue ""Send"" button and then hit ""Schedule send"".
In the mobile app, tap the three dots in the top right corner to bring up the menu which allows you to schedule messages.
From there, users can just choose the date and time you want it to drop into the recipientÃ¢ÂÂs inbox.
Scheduled messages will appear in a ""Scheduled"" folder while queued to be sent.
For some reason, Google thinks this has something to do with respecting peopleÃ¢ÂÂs digital wellness but at any rate, itÃ¢ÂÂs a welcome feature.
Until now, users had to rely on third-party Chrome extensions to schedule your messages or compose an email in draft mode and then go in a hit send at the desired time.
But now users will be able to more easily schedule emails to be sent at any time of day or night.
The company has also improved its Smart Compose technology that guesses what we want to write and pre-empts us with suggestions to speed the whole thing up. Google says it has made the technology work to be more personalised to the user and their writing style.
So hopefully Google can figure out that I am far less liberal with my exclamation marks than it seems to be.
On mobile, Google is also bringing Smart Compose to Android and iOS, no longer making it exclusive to its own Pixel 3 smartphone.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-03-19/news_big_images/485199_12557744.jpg,Technology,"Until now, users had to rely on third-party Chrome extensions to schedule your messages or compose an email in draft mode and then go in a hit send at the desired time.",negative
WhatsApp launches fact-check service to fight fake news in India,"
MUMBAI (Reuters) - WhatsApp on Tuesday launched a service for Indians to check the veracity of information, in the messaging platformÃ¢ÂÂs latest attempt to combat fake news in India ahead of national elections beginning this month.
WhatsApp said in a statement it was working with local startup Proto to classify messages sent to the service by users as true, false, misleading or disputed. They will also build a database of such content to better understand misinformation.
The move comes as WhatsApp, with over 200 million users in India, battles criticism of its platform being used for the spread of misinformation, while social media companies across the board work to prevent the phenomenon - particularly during sensitive events such as elections.
WhatsApp owner Facebook Inc said on Monday it had deleted 712 accounts and 390 pages in India and Pakistan for Ã¢ÂÂinauthentic behaviourÃ¢ÂÂ, saying many were linked to IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs opposition Congress party and others related to PakistanÃ¢ÂÂs military.
The first phase of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs elections are scheduled to begin on April 11, with final results expected on May 23.
Major Indian political parties have accused each other of propagating fake news on WhatsApp while denying they do so themselves. In February, a senior WhatsApp executive said parties were trying to use the app in Ã¢ÂÂways for which it was not intendedÃ¢ÂÂ.
WhatsApp had a similar challenge during Brazilian elections last year, when politicians had faced claims of spreading falsehoods on the platform.
Ã¢ÂÂThe goal of this project is to study the misinformation phenomenon at scale,Ã¢ÂÂ ProtoÃ¢ÂÂs founders Ritvvij Parrikh and Nasr ul Hadi said in a statement. Ã¢ÂÂAs more data flows in, we will be able to identify the most susceptible or affected issues, locations, languages, regions, and more.Ã¢ÂÂ
WhatsApp said Proto would be helped by two other organisations with experience working on misinformation-related projects.
Ã¢ÂÂThe challenge of viral misinformation requires more collaborative efforts and cannot be solved by any one organisation alone,Ã¢ÂÂ WhatsApp said.
The new service, dubbed Checkpoint Tipline, can receive messages in the form of images and video as well as text in English and four regional languages, it added. Checkpoint is a research project commissioned by WhatsApp.
Reuters received a message on WhatsApp containing false information and forwarded it to the service around 0640 GMT.
It was still awaiting classification more than two hours later.
Ã¢ÂÂThank you, weÃ¢ÂÂve received your request and you should hear from us again shortly,Ã¢ÂÂ a reply said.
WhatsAppÃ¢ÂÂs end-to-end encryption allows groups of many users to exchange text messages, images and video beyond the oversight of independent fact checkers or even the company itself.
In July, the company introduced a measure limiting the number of messages a user can forward, a move aimed at curbing mass forwards in India, where the spread of rumours led to several killings and sparked calls for government action.

Poland plans stricter rules for transport companies like Uber,"
WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland will require Uber to use licensed taxi drivers from next year, under a plan approved by the cabinet on Tuesday aimed at creating fair competition.
Polish taxi drivers have staged protests demanding equal rules for themselves and drivers of app-based car firms such as Uber, mytaxi and itaxi, which have become hugely popular in Polish cities but licensed taxi drivers complain they are driving down taxi fares.
They plan to hold another demonstration in Warsaw next week.
The new law to impose stricter rules on such app-based transport companies, if passed by parliament, will come into effect at the start of next year.
Uber has faced opposition to its low-cost service in other countries around the world, including in PolandÃ¢ÂÂs neighbor Czech Republic which also plans to require Uber drivers to be licensed.
In Poland, there had been speculation that Uber and other app-based taxi firms would come under greater scrutiny.
Daily newspaper Rzeczpospolita reported in January, citing UberÃ¢ÂÂs regional chief and Polish ministers, that Uber will invest 37 million zloty ($9.7 million) in its R&D center near Krakow this year, creating an additional 250 jobs. The newspaper speculated that Uber was hoping the job creation would be welcomed by the government and discourage it from tightening regulations against the company.
Uber did not respond to an emailed request for comment on Tuesday.

"After the Moon in 2024, NASA wants to reach Mars by 2033","
WASHINGTON (AFP) - NASA has made it clear they want astronauts back on the Moon in 2024, and now, they are zeroing in on the Red Planet - the US space agency confirmed that it wants humans to reach Mars by 2033.
Jim Bridenstine, NASAÃ¢ÂÂs administrator, said Tuesday that in order to achieve that goal, other parts of the program - including a lunar landing - need to move forward more quickly.
""We want to achieve a Mars landing in 2033,"" Bridenstine told lawmakers at a congressional hearing on Capitol Hill.
""We can move up the Mars landing by moving up the Moon landing. The Moon is the proving ground,"" added the former Republican congressman, who was appointed by President Donald Trump.
NASA is racing to enact the plans of Trump, who dispatched Vice President Mike Pence to announce that the timetable for once again putting man on the Moon had been cut by four years to 2024.
The new date is politically significant: it would be the final year in TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs eventual second term at the White House.
Many experts and lawmakers are concerned that NASA cannot make the deadline, especially given the major delays in development of its new heavy-lift rocket, the Space Launch System, which is being built by aerospace giant Boeing.
Any mission to Mars would take at least two years, given the distance to be traveled. Getting there alone would take six months, as opposed to the three days needed to reach the Moon.
A round trip to Mars can only take place when the Red Planet is positioned on the same side of the Sun as Earth that occurs about every 26 months, so the dates are 2031, 2033, and so on.
In 2017, a NASA budget bill set 2033 as the target date for the first manned mission to Mars, but NASA itself has talked about the ""2030s"" in its roadmap.
NASA wants to learn how to extract and use the tons of ice at the MoonÃÂ s south pole.
""Water ice represents air to breathe, it represents water to drink, it represents fuel,"" Bridenstine said.
""The intent of course is to not just get humans to the surface of the Moon but prove that we can live and work on another world.""
Democratic lawmaker Eddie Bernice Johnson, the chair of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, asked Bridenstine to put a price tag on the new schedule.
The NASA chief said he would make his updated budget request by April 15.

"US, China leading race for 5G wireless","
WASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States and China are in a virtual deadlock in the race for 5G, or fifth-generation wireless networks expected to unlock new services, an industry survey showed Tuesday.
The report shows the United States has closed the gap with China in ""readiness"" for the ultrafast wireless systems and has more 5G deployments planned in 2019 than any other country.
The study for the wireless industry group CTIA and conducted by the research firm Analysis Mason showed the US moved ahead of South Korea in 5G readiness over the past year to a virtual tie with China, as a result of considerable investment in 5G systems.
CTIA president Meredith Attwell Baker said in a statement that the United States has made ""impressive strides"" in preparing for the new technology but that more is needed to maintain leadership.
""We canÃ¢ÂÂt be complacent as the 5G race has really just begun,"" she said.
""We must redouble our efforts to combat the 5G ambitions and investments by China and others.""
Analysts expect 5G networks to play a crucial role in delivering data for autonomous vehicles, remote medicine and other services with heavy data usage.
US officials have sought to block Chinese firms such as Huawei from deploying 5G systems on national security grounds, raising concerns that this will slow the rollout of high-speed networks.
Officials have also floated the idea of a government-backed 5G network which could be more secure against foreign espionage, an idea roundly opposed by the telecom industry.
According to the report, the US leads with 92 commercial 5G deployments planned for 2019 but noted that ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs wireless operators are conducting ""hundreds of large-scale 5G trials across the country.""
""China retains a significant infrastructure advantage,"" the report said. ""A recent study showed China with more than 14 wireless cell sites per 10,000 people, compared to 4.7 in the United States.""
The report said to maintain growth in 5G, the US needs to do more to allocate wireless spectrum, in some cases reassigning bands now used for other purposes.
According to the survey, South Korea ranked third in 5G readiness, followed by Japan, Britain and Italy.

Facebook seeks tab to promote 'high quality journalism',"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - Facebook is working on a ""news tab"" that could be used to financially support ""high quality and trustworthy"" journalism, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said Monday.
Zuckerberg made the comments in a video conversation about the future of technology and society with Mathias Doepfner, chairman of German-based media giant Axel Springer.
Zuckerberg said he sees interest in building a product separate from its personalized feed that would serve people who want news from professional media.
""We want this to surface high quality and trustworthy information,"" Zuckerberg said in the video.
""ThereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of people who have a demand (for) more news.""
Zuckerberg said he believes as many as 10 to 15 percent of Facebook users would be interested in a dedicated news tab.
The news tab would be created in a way to compensate news organizations whose content is selected, he noted.
""WeÃ¢ÂÂre not going to have journalists making news,"" he said.
The comments marked a new direction for Facebook, which has been accused of enabling the spread of misinformation and hoaxes on its ""news feed"" that contains posts from friends as well as other content personalized for users.
Zuckerberg reiterated that Facebook did not want to be a ""publisher,"" a longstanding position it has taken to avoid being considered a media company, but was willing to be a partner for the sector.
""ItÃÂ s important to me that we help people get trustworthy news and find solutions that help journalists around the world do their important work,"" Zuckerberg said in a post accompanying the video.
Zuckerberg said any news tab would require ""curation"" or selection, without offering details, and that he would hope to build this in consultation with news organizations.
He noted that details of this new product were still being studied but that he sees a possibility that it could help news organizations struggling with the transition to digital content.
""There is a real opportunity in a separate news service to have better monetization for publishers than we have in news feed,"" he said.
""Facebook could potentially have a direct relationship with publishers to make sure their content is available.""

E-cigarettes haven't made teen smoking cool again,"
PARIS (AFP) - The rapid spread of e-cigarette use among young teenagers has not slowed the decline in smoking in the same age group, much less reversed it, according to a new study.
Nor has vaping caused 13-to-15 year olds canvassed in Britain to see tobacco use in a more positive light, researchers reported Tuesday.
The findings, published in the BMJ journal Thorax, are the latest to conclude that nicotine-delivering electronic cigarettes are not, as once feared, a gateway drug for tobacco.
""Our research does not support the hypothesis that e-cigarettes Ã¢ÂÂrenormalizedÃ¢ÂÂ youth smoking during a period of growing but largely unregulated use in the UK,"" the study concluded.
But neither did it alleviate growing concern about the health consequences of vaping, which remain largely unknown in part because the practice is so new.
It took decades, experts point out, to determine that smoking tobacco -- which accounts for more than seven million premature deaths worldwide every year -- is truly dangerous.
Research on nearly 100,000 adults in the United States -- presented at a major conference last month there -- showed that e-cigarette use increases the likelihood of heart attacks, coronary artery disease and depression by 34, 25 and 55 percent respectively.
Rates of these conditions were far higher among smokers.
Another study from February, published in the Nature Journal Scientific Reports, linked chemicals used in 90 percent of vaping systems to impaired lung function.
""We must take aggressive steps to protect our children from these highly potent products,"" the US Surgeon General said in a rare public advisory in December, warning of the harmful impact of nicotine on still-developing brains.
The new findings looked at changes in behavior and attitude among a quarter of a million young teens in Britain from 1998 to 2015.
During that period, they found, the percentage of 13-to-15 year olds who had smoked at least once fell from 70 to 27, and the share of regular smokers dropped from 19 to five percent.
Smoking not Ã¢ÂÂrenormalizedÃ¢ÂÂ
Perceptions changed as well. Only 27 percent of young teens in 2015 said it was ""OK to try a cigarette"", compared with 70 percent 15 years earlier.
Crucially, the rate at which these shifts took place barely slowed, if at all, from 2011 to 2015, the period when e-cigarettes were taking off.
""Favorable perceptions of regular smoking among this age group also fell at a faster rate after the proliferation of e-cigarettes, which would not be expected if smoking was in the process of being Ã¢ÂÂrenormalizedÃ¢ÂÂ,"" the authors concluded.
Figures from the rest of Europe and North America suggest similar trends.
The use of e-cigarettes in the United States jumped by more than 75 percent in 2018 compared with the year before, prompting the US Food and Drug Administration to call last fall tighter regulations.
Teens in every age bracket are today more likely to vape than to smoke cigarettes, according to the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).
Nearly 10 percent of 13-to-14 year olds said they had vaped within the last month, but less than four percent had lit up a cigarette, the NIDA reported in November.
For 17-to-18 year olds, the gap closed, but the number of smokers was still 50 percent lower than users of e-cigarettes.
In the United States today, one in 20 adults -- or more than 10 million people -- use e-cigarettes, while three times as many are smokers.

Facebook reveals how it ranks items in the news feed,"
LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook is lifting the lid on the algorithm that decides which posts appear in its news feed, as part of a drive to be more transparent and offer greater control to users.
The feature Ã¢ÂÂWhy am I seeing this post?Ã¢ÂÂ, being rolled out from Monday, offers some insight into the tens of thousands of inputs used by the social network to rank stories, photos and video in the news feed, the foundation of the platform.
Ã¢ÂÂThe basic thing that this tool does is let people see why they are seeing a particular post in their news feed, and it helps them access the actions they might want to take if they want to change that,Ã¢ÂÂ FacebookÃ¢ÂÂs Head of News Feed John Hegeman told reporters on Monday.
After a series of privacy scandals, Facebook needs to regain usersÃ¢ÂÂ trust as it prepares to roll out a single messaging service combining Facebook messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram that could make it even more central to usersÃ¢ÂÂ communications.
The new news feed feature will show users the data that connect them to a particular type of post, Hegeman said, for example that they are friends with the poster and theyÃ¢ÂÂve liked their posts more than others, theyÃ¢ÂÂve frequently commented on that type of post before, or that the post is popular with users with the same interests.
It will detail some of the interactions that lead the algorithm to reach its conclusion, he said, although it will not show all of the thousands of inputs that influence the decision.
Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂve tried to really focus on the signals that are most important and play the biggest role in what causes people to see a post or not,Ã¢ÂÂ Hegeman said.
Ã¢ÂÂWe donÃ¢ÂÂt think this is going to solve everything on the theme of transparency but we think this is an important step.Ã¢ÂÂ
Facebook developed the new tool with research groups in New York, Denver, Paris and Berlin, he said, and as a result of feedback Facebook has made it easy for users to access tools to control what is in the news feed themselves.
Facebook is also updating its Ã¢ÂÂWhy Am I Seeing this Ad?Ã¢ÂÂ feature launched a few years ago with additional details, Hegeman said, such as explaining how ads work that target customers using email lists.
The company shifted its strategy for its centrepiece news feed in early 2018 when it decided to prioritise posts from family and friends and downgrade non-advertising content from publishers and brands.

NASA chief terms India's destruction of one of its satellites a 'terrible thing',"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - The head of NASA on Monday branded IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs destruction of one of its satellites a ""terrible thing"" that had created 400 pieces of orbital debris and led to new dangers for astronauts aboard the International Space Station.
Jim Bridenstine was addressing employees of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration five days after India shot down a low-orbiting satellite in a missile test to prove it was among the worldÃ¢ÂÂs advanced space powers.
Not all of the pieces were big enough to track, Bridenstine explained. ""What we are tracking right now, objects big enough to track -- weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about 10 centimeters (six inches) or bigger -- about 60 pieces have been tracked.""
The Indian satellite was destroyed at a relatively low altitude of 180 miles (300 kilometers), well below the ISS and most satellites in orbit.
But 24 of the pieces ""are going above the apogee of the International Space Station,"" said Bridenstine.
""That is a terrible, terrible thing to create an event that sends debris at an apogee that goes above the International Space Station,"" he continued, adding: ""That kind of activity is not compatible with the future of human spaceflight.""
""ItÃ¢ÂÂs unacceptable and NASA needs to be very clear about what its impact to us is.""
The US military tracks objects in space to predict the collision risk for the ISS and for satellites. They are currently tracking 23,000 objects larger than 10 centimeters.
That includes about 10,000 pieces of space debris, of which nearly 3,000 were created by a single event: a Chinese anti-satellite test in 2007 at 530 miles from the surface.
As a result of the Indian test, the  risk of collision with the ISS has increased by 44 percent over 10 days, Bridenstine said.
But the risk will dissipate over time as much of the debris will burn up as it enters the atmosphere.

"Facebook, rights groups hit out at Singapore's fake news bill","
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore submitted wide-ranging fake news legislation in parliament on Monday, stoking fears from internet firms and human rights groups that it may give the government too much power and hinder freedom of speech.
The law would require social media sites like Facebook to carry warnings on posts the government deems false and remove comments against Ã¢ÂÂpublic interestÃ¢ÂÂ.
The move came two days after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said governments should play a more active role in regulating the online platform.
But Simon Milner, who works on FacebookÃ¢ÂÂs public policy in Asia, said after the law was tabled, the firm was Ã¢ÂÂconcerned with aspects of the law that grant broad powers to the Singapore executive branch to compel us to remove content they deem to be false and proactively push a government notification to usersÃ¢ÂÂ.
Ã¢ÂÂAs the most far-reaching legislation of its kind to date, this level of overreach poses significant risks to freedom of expression and speech, and could have severe ramifications both in Singapore and around the world,Ã¢ÂÂ said Jeff Paine, managing director of the Asia Internet Coalition, an industry association of internet and technology companies in the region.
Speaking to reporters on Monday, SingaporeÃ¢ÂÂs Law Minister K. Shanmugam said the new legislation would not hinder free speech.
Ã¢ÂÂThis legislation deals with false statements of facts. It doesnÃ¢ÂÂt deal with opinions, it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt deal with viewpoints. You can have whatever viewpoints however reasonable or unreasonable,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.
Tech giants Facebook, Twitter and Google all have their Asia headquarters in the city-state, a low-tax finance hub seen as a island of stability in the middle of the fast-growing but often-turbulent Southeast Asia region.

Ã¢ÂÂMALICIOUS ACTORSÃ¢ÂÂ

Singapore, which has been run by the same political party since independence from Britain more than 50 years ago, says it is vulnerable to fake news because of its position as a global financial hub, its mixed ethnic and religious population and widespread internet access.
It is ranked 151 among 180 countries rated in the World Press Freedom Index of Reporters Without Borders, a non-government group that promotes freedom of information, below the likes of Russia and Myanmar.
The new bill proposes that the government get online platforms to publish warnings or Ã¢ÂÂcorrectionsÃ¢ÂÂ alongside posts carrying false information, without removing them.
This would be the Ã¢ÂÂprimary responseÃ¢ÂÂ to counter falsehoods online, the Law Ministry said.
Ã¢ÂÂThat way, in a sense, people can read whatever they want and make up their minds. That is our preference,Ã¢ÂÂ Law Minister K. Shanmugam told reporters on Monday.
Under the proposals, which must be approved by parliament, criminal sanctions including hefty fines and jail terms will be imposed if the falsehoods are spread by Ã¢ÂÂmalicious actorsÃ¢ÂÂ who Ã¢ÂÂundermine societyÃ¢ÂÂ, the ministry said, without elaborating.
It added that it would cut off an online siteÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂability to profitÃ¢ÂÂ, without shutting it down, if the site had published three falsehoods that were Ã¢ÂÂagainst the public interestÃ¢ÂÂ over the previous six months.
It did not say how it would block a siteÃ¢ÂÂs profit streams.
The bill came amid talk of a possible general election this year. Law Minister Shanmugam declined to comment when asked if the new legislation was related to a vote.
Ã¢ÂÂThis draft law will be a disaster for human rights, particularly freedom of expression and media freedom,Ã¢ÂÂ said Phil Robertson, deputy director, Asia division, at Human Rights Watch.
Ã¢ÂÂThe definitions in the law are broad and poorly defined, leaving maximum regulatory discretion to the government officers skewed to view as Ã¢ÂÂmisleadingÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂfalseÃ¢ÂÂ the sorts of news that challenge SingaporeÃ¢ÂÂs preferred political narratives.Ã¢ÂÂ

NASA and MIT model new airplane wing for flight efficiency,"
(Web Desk) Ã¢ÂÂ A team of researchers from NASA and MIT has created a new type of airplane wing that can alter its shape to control the planeÃ¢ÂÂs flight for providing a significant boost in aircraft production, flight, and maintenance efficiency, researchers say.
Assembled from hundreds of tiny identical pieces, the new approach of wing construction could afford greater flexibility in the design and manufacturing of future aircraft Ã¢ÂÂ thus making air travel far more efficient.
In a paper published in the journal Smart Materials and Structures on Monday, the researchers describe how they built an airplane wing from hundreds of identical, lightweight cube-like structures, all bolted together and then covered with a thin polymer material.
The design allows the wing to change shape automatically; adjusting itself to whatever configuration is optimal for the current phase of flight Ã¢ÂÂ with one configuration for take-off, for example, and another for landing.

ÃÂ  ÃÂ  ÃÂ ÃÂ Wing assembly is seen under construction, assembled from hundreds of identical subunits, in a NASA wind tunnel

Bigger and Better

The wing the researchers created and tested for the new paper is about the same size as what youÃ¢ÂÂd find on a single-seater plane, according to MIT News, but theyÃ¢ÂÂd already demonstrated their designÃ¢ÂÂs feasibility with a smaller wing several years ago.
Not only does this new wing show that the concept scales up to a size that could carry a person, but it also demonstrates a new manufacturing process that cuts the time needed to produce each individual structure down from several minutes to just 17 seconds.
""The research shows promise for reducing cost and increasing the performance for large, light weight, stiff structures,"" Aurora Flight Sciences structures researcher Daniel Campbell, who wasnÃ¢ÂÂt involved in the research, told MIT News.

""Most promising near-term applications are structural applications for airships and space-based structures, such as antennas.""
Researchers explain that for each of the phases of a flightÃ¢ÂÂtakeoff and landing, cruising, maneuvering and so onÃ¢ÂÂeach has its own, different set of optimal wing parameters, so a conventional wing is necessarily a compromise that is not optimized for any of these, and therefore sacrifices efficiency. A wing that is constantly deformable could provide a much better approximation of the best configuration for each stage.

While it would be possible to include motors and cables to produce the forces needed to deform the wings, the team has taken this a step further and designed a system that automatically responds to changes in its aerodynamic loading conditions by shifting its shapeÃ¢ÂÂa sort of self-adjusting, passive wing-reconfiguration process.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-02-19/news_big_images/485030_29364523.jpg,Technology,"Assembled from hundreds of tiny identical pieces, the new approach of wing construction could afford greater flexibility in the design and manufacturing of future aircraft Â thus making air travel far more efficient.",negative

Keen Lab, a two-time honoree of TeslaÃ¢ÂÂs ""bug bounty"" hall of fame program, said in a research paper on Saturday that it found two ways to trick AutopilotÃ¢ÂÂs lane recognition through changing the physical road surface.
The first attempt to confuse Autopilot used blurring patches on the left-lane line, which the team said was too difficult for someone to actually deploy in the real world and easy for TeslaÃ¢ÂÂs computer to recognise.
""It is difficult for an attacker to deploy some unobtrusive markings in the physical world to disable the lane recognition function of a moving Tesla vehicle,"" Keen said.
The researchers said they suspected that Tesla also handled this situation well because itÃ¢ÂÂs already added many ""abnormal lanes"" in its training set of Autopilot miles. This gives Tesla vehicles a good sense of lane direction even without good lighting, or in inclement weather, they said.

Not deterred by the low plausibility of the first idea, Keen then set out to make TeslaÃ¢ÂÂs Autopilot mistakenly think there was a traffic lane when one wasnÃ¢ÂÂt actually present.
The researchers painted three tiny squares in the traffic lane to mimic merge striping and cause the car to veer into oncoming traffic in the left lane.
""Misleading the autopilot vehicle to the wrong direction [of traffic] with some patches made by a malicious attacker is sometimes more dangerous than making it fail to recognise the lane,"" Keen said. 
""If the vehicle knows that the fake lane is pointing to the reverse lane, it should ignore this fake lane and then it could avoid a traffic accident.""
In response to KeenÃ¢ÂÂs findings, Tesla said the issues didnÃ¢ÂÂt represent real-world problems and no drivers had encountered any of the reportÃ¢ÂÂs identified problems.
""In this demonstration the researchers adjusted the physical environment (e.g. placing tape on the road or altering lane lines) around the vehicle to make the car behave differently when Autopilot is in use,"" the company said.
""This is not a real-world concern given that a driver can easily override Autopilot at any time by using the steering wheel or brakes and should be prepared to do so at all times.""
TeslaÃ¢ÂÂs Enhanced Autopilot supports a variety of capabilities, including lane-centering, self-parking, and the ability to automatically change lanes with the driverÃ¢ÂÂs confirmation. The feature is now mostly called ""Autopilot"" after Tesla reshuffled the Autopilot price structure. It primarily relies on cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and radar to gather information about its surroundings, including nearby obstacles, terrain, and lane changes. It then feeds the data into onboard computers that use machine learning to make judgements in real time about the best way to respond.
In a detailed, 37-page report, the researchers wrote:
""Tesla autopilot moduleÃ¢ÂÂs lane recognition function has a good robustness in an ordinary external environment (no strong light, rain, snow, sand and dust interference), but it still doesnÃ¢ÂÂt handle the situation correctly in our test scenario. This kind of attack is simple to deploy, and the materials are easy to obtain. As we talked in the previous introduction of TeslaÃ¢ÂÂs lane recognition function, Tesla uses a pure computer vision solution for lane recognition, and we found in this attack experiment that the vehicle driving decision is only based on computer vision lane recognition results. Our experiments proved that this architecture has security risks and reverse lane recognition is one of the necessary functions for autonomous driving in non-closed roads. In the scene we build, if the vehicle knows that the fake lane is pointing to the reverse lane, it should ignore this fake lane and then it could avoid a traffic accident.""",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-02-19/news_big_images/485025_51477309.jpg,Technology,"The first attempt to confuse Autopilot used blurring patches on the left-lane line, which the team said was too difficult for someone to actually deploy in the real world and easy for TeslaÂs computer to recognise.",positive
"Indian satellite destruction created 400 pieces of debris, endangering ISS: NASA","
WASHINGTON (AFP) - The head of NASA on Monday branded IndiaÃÂ s destruction of one of its satellites a ""terrible thing"" that had created 400 pieces of orbital debris and led to new dangers for astronauts aboard the International Space Station.
Jim Bridenstine was addressing employees of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration five days after India shot down a low-orbiting satellite in a missile test to prove it was among the worldÃÂ s advanced space powers.
Not all of the pieces were big enough to track, Bridenstine explained. ""What we are tracking right now, objects big enough to track -- weÃÂ re talking about 10 centimeters (six inches) or bigger -- about 60 pieces have been tracked.""
The Indian satellite was destroyed at a relatively low altitude of 180 miles (300 kilometers), well below the ISS and most satellites in orbit.
But 24 of the pieces ""are going above the apogee of the International Space Station,"" said Bridenstine.
""That is a terrible, terrible thing to create an event that sends debris at an apogee that goes above the International Space Station,"" he continued, adding: ""That kind of activity is not compatible with the future of human spaceflight.""
""ItÃÂ s unacceptable and NASA needs to be very clear about what its impact to us is.""
The US military tracks objects in space to predict the collision risk for the ISS and for satellites. They are currently tracking 23,000 objects larger than 10 centimeters.
That includes about 10,000 pieces of space debris, of which nearly 3,000 were created by a single event: a Chinese anti-satellite test in 2007 at 530 miles from the surface.
As a result of the Indian test, the  risk of collision with the ISS has increased by 44 percent over 10 days, Bridenstine said.
But the risk will dissipate over time as much of the debris will burn up as it enters the atmosphere.

"Walking daily in green spaces safeguards overall health, reduces depression","
ISLAMABAD (APP) - A daily walk for at least 30 minutes in a green area like a park or on a trail does wonders for body in general and for brain and heart in particular.
Walking is a powerful mood medicine that safeguards brain health and sharpens memory.
Medical specialists are of the view that just 12 minutes of walk in a green area increases joviality, vigor, attentiveness and self-confidence as compared with the same time spent in sitting.
While walking, breathing in cooler air can help regulate and even lower the temperature of brain and a cool brain is more pleasurable to body and mind than a warm brain.
Moreover, deep breathing exercise in open aids some of the systems of body which are harmed by stress.
Further, these exercises can reduce blood pressure and may even be able to change the expression of genes.
In addition to that, it is a medically proven fact that besides scenery of green area, chirping of birds is a powerful anti-depressant.
Medical practitioner Dr. Saima Razak laying emphasis on the importance of walk said it was a physical activity in the open and had its own merits.
She further said, Ã¢ÂÂWalk reduces depression, boosts self-esteem and improves overall body functions.""
According to Medical experts, while walking, breathing in cooler air can help regulate and even lower the temperature of brain and a cool brain is more pleasurable to body and mind than a warm brain.
Moreover, deep breathing exercise in open aid some of the systems of body which are harmed by stress.
Further, these exercises can reduce blood pressure and may even be able to change the expression of genes.
According to psychiatrists, a daily walk for at least 30 minutes prompts the body to release hormones endorphins which reduce perception of pain and also trigger a positive feeling in the body.
This positive feeling, they say is good for over all well being of the body in general and for heart and brain in particular thus endorsing the popular saying that a healthy body has a healthy mind.
According to scientific studies the consumption of volume of oxygen (VO2) by the body for regular functioning of its parts is essential because more the volume of oxygen consumed by the body, the more perfectly its parts work.
It merits a mention here that highly oxidative organs such as the heart has a high demand for oxygen and therefore has a relatively high oxygen consumption.
Similarly, the brain consumes about 25 percent of a persons oxygen intake.
Consultant physician and Chest Specialist Dr. Zaheer Ahmed told APP that a brisk walk for 30 to 45 minutes daily in a park or along roadside in the morning was best for staying healthy.
He, however, cautioned that a heart patient should go for a walk after consultation with his doctor.
Symptoms of heart disease as pointed by Dr. Zaheer were:
-Tiredness after walking a lilttle bit.
-A rapid heart beat after going upstairs.
-Congestion in the chest or chest pain after a brisk walk.
Dr. Zaheer advised that anybody having the above mentioned symptoms should immediately consult a doctor.
When asked what should be the diet to prevent heart diseases he stressed that it should be very simple based on vegetables, fruits and fruit juices.
Ã¢ÂÂToo much red meat should not be used; only once a week or once a month it should be taken .Ã¢ÂÂ
Dr. Zaheer advised that white meat and fish should be preferred.
The use of salt and oil, he said, should be minimal.
Reportedly, a French cyclist continued to chase records at the age of 105 by biking around a track in an hour. Robert Marchand completed 92 laps within an hour in front of hundreds of fans at the velodrome at Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines in france.
Merchand has set multiple cycling records in the over-100s category, including traveling 16 miles in an hour at the age of 102, and a new over-105s category to accomodate his new achievement.
According to doctors MerchandÃ¢ÂÂs VO2 maximum oxygen consumption is the same as a man of half his age who doesnÃ¢ÂÂt do any sports.
Different medical practitioners while talking to APP recommended daily walk for 30 minutes to make body healthier.
The medical experts observed that people in communities with abundant green space generally enjoy better health.
Three golden rules to stay away from diseases as advised by medical expert were:
-Regular walk
-Simple food (Maximum consumption of fruits and vegetables)
-No heavy diet.ÃÂ ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-01-19/news_big_images/484949_99424520.jpg,Technology,"This positive feeling, they say is good for over all well being of the body in general and for heart and brain in particular thus endorsing the popular saying that a healthy body has a healthy mind.",positive
