Indian claims of downing Pakistan's F-16 fall flat on its face,"
(Web Desk) – Ever since the Balakot incident, ‘Magnificent India’ has come up with one fabricated story of false bravado after another.
In hind sight one can only decipher, what was more damaging to the Modi regime’s hegemonic designs carved by the ‘Hindutva doctrine.’
Was it the lame attempts of India at showing off its aerial dominance; through trespassing Pakistani territory only to de-root a few trees, especially in an election year when all eyes are on the poll results and the anti-Pakistan rhetoric was to play significant role in its last attempt at sweeping in the general elections?
Or was it engaging Pakistan in an aerial dogfight resulting only into a humiliating downing of its jets and capture of the IAF pilot Abhinandan by Pakistan.
Nevertheless, the Indian media’s drum beating, creating war hysteria to up the nationalist agenda proved quite futile, when no one from the international community backed up the Indian claims.
More sorry state of affairs surfaced when one proof after another put a stamp on India’s fictitious claims aimed at misleading the naive masses.
The recent blow to the Indian superiority bubble came today when a leading magazine published a piece, on ‘No F-16 found missing from Pakistan’s arsenal,’ again disapproving Indian heroic and miraculous claims of shoot down of F-16 by a MIG-21.
The Indians still dumbfounded by the latest revelations, are asking questions to their government of what really went down that day, though some are still sticking to their own claims of downing an F-16 coming up with more fabricated lies.
Social media was filled with questions and criticism on both sides of borders with F-16 the top trend on Twitter in India.
Pakistanis were overjoyed as it was another feat in their favor, feeling proud of their armed forces capability and superiority.
Let’s ponder on the days happenings on Twitter; the social media battle field of the internet warriors.
Some irked Indian’s called the whole charade as Modi’s wonderland.

We shot down our own helicopter. Pakistan shot down our MIG21. PM lied that we shot down Pakistan F16 . PM sought vote for valour of Army which actually didnt happened and its proved without doubt. Welcome to wonderland of Modishah? @atti_cus

"Govt not going anywhere, you are going to jail, PM Imran tells Asif Zardari","
JAMRUD (Dunya News) – Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday while lashing out at former president and Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari said that the government was not going anywhere but you are going to land in jail.
Addressing a public gathering in Jamrud on Friday, he said that Pakistan is going through difficult economic time but it will be over soon, adding that during the tenure of Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP), Pakistan’s total debt was Rs6000 billion which soared to Rs30,000 billion during the tenure of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).
Imran Khan challenged the PPP co-chairman to hold demonstration in Islamabad for at least a week and said that a sit-in is only successful when you deliver the public’s narrative.
The prime minister said that the PML-N was expert in money laundering and stealing money.
Imran Khan said that Rs100 billion would be spent in tribal areas in next 10 years, aiding that interest free loan will also be provided to the youth.
While announcing supply of gas, water and electricity for Jamrud, the PM said development projects will be initiated in the tribal areas. “Torkham border will be opened round the clock,” Khan added.
On Thursday, addressing a public gathering in Garhi Khuda Baksh, former president Asif Ali Zardari said that time has come to send the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government packing.

Zardari asked the people to be prepared for march towards Islamabad. “Be patient, we will announce a campaign soon to bring topple the government. We will not stage sit-in like them (PTI) and will continue sleeping on the roads till they resign.”
Criticizing the government’s policies and inflation, the former president said the prices of vegetables have doubled during the PTI government’s tenure.
“I had already said the PTI government’s main target is 18th government,” he added.
Later, addressing the gathering, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari also lashed out at PM Imran Khan and his government.
Bilawal said, ""the PTI government has done nothing with sincerity except lying."" He said PTI government launched inquiries through National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to scare PPP leaders, adding that NAB is exacting revenge instead of carrying accountability.
The PPP chairman said, ""The stories of Benami (fake accounts) are just stories and allegations."" Paying rich tribute to ZAB, Bilawal said today is the 40th martyrdom anniversary of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
He went on to say, ""They (PTI and Imran Khan) say Pakistan has become bankrupt due to the 18th amendment. The Benami Prime Minister does not know strong provinces are the sign of a strong federation."" Bilawal added they (federal government) does not want Sindh but wants to grab its gas, water and other resources.

US count exposes India's claim of shooting down Pakistani F-16: Foreign Policy,"
WASHINGTON (Web Desk) – India’s lie was once again exposed when Foreign Policy reported that New Delhi misled the international community by claiming that a Pakistani F-16 was shot down.
India’s claim of shooting down a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet in an aerial battle between the two nuclear powers in February appears to be wrong, the report said. Two senior U.S. defense officials with direct knowledge of the situation told Foreign Policy that U.S. personnel recently counted Islamabad’s F-16s and found none missing.
The findings directly contradict the account of Indian Air Force officials, who said that Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman managed to shoot down a Pakistani F-16 before his own plane was downed by a Pakistani missile.
The count, conducted by U.S. authorities on the ground in Pakistan, sheds doubt on New Delhi’s version of events, suggesting that Indian authorities may have misled the international community about what happened that day.
The dogfight between the two nations occurred on February 27. During the aerial battle, Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman took a missile hit and ejected safely into Pakistani territory.
He was captured by the Pakistani army and released days later in an effort to de-escalate the crisis.
One of the senior U.S. defense officials with direct knowledge of the count said that Pakistan invited the United States to physically count its F-16 planes after the incident as part of an end-user agreement signed when the foreign military sale was finalized. Generally in such agreements, the United States requires the receiving country to allow U.S. officials to inspect the equipment regularly to ensure it is accounted for and protected.
Some of the aircraft were not immediately available for inspection due to the conflict, so it took U.S. personnel several weeks to account for all of the jets, the official said.
But now the count has been completed, and “all aircraft were present and accounted for,” the official said.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-05-19/news_big_images/485572_55065376.jpg,pakistan

Asked about the claims made against him and whether more women might come forward with similar allegations, Biden said he ""wouldn t be surprised.""
But he added: ""I’ve had hundreds and hundreds of people contact me -- who I don’t know -- and say the exact opposite.""
On Wednesday, Biden released a video on social media addressing his physical contact with women, pledging to ""be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future.""
President Donald Trump -- who has faced his own share of accusations over his conduct with women, some far more serious than those facing Biden -- was quick to mock the Democrat on Twitter.
He also dismissed the former senator and vice president as a potential challenger in 2020.
""I don’t see Joe Biden as a threat,"" Trump told reporters Friday. ""I think he s only a threat to himself.""
Biden made an awkward joke about the situation Friday during his speech before the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, telling the crowd that ""I had permission to hug"" the union’s president.
In his address, he stressed his family’s blue-collar roots and wondered aloud how some Americans had ""gotten so damn elitist.""
""This country was not built by Wall Street bankers, and CEOs and hedge fund managers,"" he said.
""It was built by the great American middle class,"" and the group that forged the country’s middle class was ""unions,"" he added.
Trump, despite saying he was unworried about a Biden challenge, posted what appeared to be a goading tweet just as the former vice president stopped talking, suggesting he might have been watching.
""I’ve employed thousands of Electrical Workers. They will be voting for me!"" Trump tweeted.

UN chief to meet eastern Libya commander as fighters close in on Tripoli,"
TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI (Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was due to meet eastern Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar in Benghazi on Friday in a bid to avert renewed civil war as his forces advanced on the capital Tripoli to challenge the internationally recognised government.
The military thrust by Haftar s Libyan National Army (LNA), which is allied to a parallel administration based in the east, marked a dangerous escalation of a power struggle that has dragged on since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
LNA forces on Thursday took Gharyan, about 80 km (50 miles) south of Tripoli after skirmishes with forces allied to Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj.
But they failed to take a checkpoint about 30 km west of the capital in a bid to close the coastal road to Tunisia. An LNA-allied militia withdrew overnight from so-called Gate 27, leaving it abandoned in the morning, a Reuters reporter said.
Meanwhile militias allied to the U.N.-backed Tripoli government moved more machinegun-mounted pickups from the coastal city of Misrata to Tripoli to defend it against Haftar s forces.
Libyan forces allied to Tripoli have taken 145 troops prisoner from the Eastern forces, a commander said on Friday.
The prisoners were captured in the town of Zawiya west of Tripoli, said Mohamed Alhudairi, commander of the operations room for the western region. He told Reuters 60 vehicles had also been confiscated.
An eastern military source confirmed that 128 men had been captured, without elaborating.
The escalation surprised the United Nations, whose Secretary-General Guterres had been in Tripoli this week to help organize a national reconciliation national conference planned for later this month.
Guterres, who spent Thursday night in the heavily fortified U.N. compound in a Tripoli suburb, was flying to Benghazi on Friday to meet Haftar.
He will also go to Tobruk, another eastern city, to meet lawmakers of the House of Representatives, which is also allied to Haftar.
""My aim remains the same: avoid a military confrontation. I reiterate that there is no military solution for the Libyan crisis, only a political one,"" Guterres said on Twitter.
Assembly President Aguila Saleh welcomed the offensive, a spokesman said.
Haftar also enjoys the backing of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, which see him as bulwark against Islamists and have supported him militarily, according to U.N. reports.

 
INTERNATIONAL CONCERN

Germany called an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council due to the military escalation.
Russia said it was not helping Haftar s forces and it supported a negotiated political settlement that ruled out any new bloodshed.
""The situation should be resolved peacefully,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
Former colonial power Italy, which lies across the Mediterranean from Libya, was very worried by the turn of events, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said.
""We need to throw water on the fire, not petrol on the fire. I hope that people, acting out of economic or business self-interest, is not looking for a military solution, which would be devastating,"" Salvini said.
The United Nations and Western countries have been trying to mediate between Serraj and Haftar, who met in Abu Dhabi last month to discuss a power-sharing deal.
The conference the United Nations is helping to organize is aimed at forging agreement on a road map for elections to resolve the prolonged instability in Libya, an oil producer and transit point for refugees and migrants trekking across the Sahara with the aim of reaching Europe.

Judge orders psychiatric test for Christchurch shooting suspect,"
CHRISTCHURCH (AFP) - The man accused of shooting dead 50 Muslim worshippers in a Christchurch mosque sat impassively Friday as a New Zealand judge ordered him to undergo tests to determine if he is mentally fit to stand trial for murder.
Survivors and relatives of those killed in the March 15 attacks packed into a Christchurch courtroom as alleged gunman Brenton Tarrant appeared via audio-visual link from a maximum-security prison in Auckland.
The 28-year-old Australian faces 50 murder and 39 attempted murder charges over the shootings at two mosques, which shocked the world and rattled normally peaceful New Zealand.
High Court judge Cameron Mander ruled during the brief hearing that Tarrant would be examined by two health assessors to determine ""whether he is fit to stand trial or insane"".
The suspect -- a self-avowed white supremacist -- sat motionless throughout the hearing, listening intently to proceedings.
He was not required to enter a plea and was remanded in custody until his next court appearance on June 14.
About 50 people were in the court s public gallery to catch a glimpse of the man charged with the deadliest massacre in modern New Zealand history.
While the public gallery could see Tarrant on screen, the position of the camera in court ensured his view from prison was restricted to the judge and lawyers.
For most, Tarrant s appearance on screen was the first chance to see the face of the man accused of gunning down their loved ones in cold blood.
Yama Nabi, whose 71-year-old father was killed, went to bear witness on behalf of his ""heartbroken"" family.
""I just wanted to see his face... it s not going to bring the loved ones back. I was like (he s a) coward,"" he told reporters outside the court.
Survivor Tofazzal Alam lay down in the Linwood mosque to avoid being shot during the attack and never saw the gunman up close.
""I wanted to see him because he killed so many of my friends. He looks crazy and it was very upsetting,"" he said after the hearing.
""I m very upset to see him. He killed 50 people and he doesn t look like he s bothered. I didn t see any emotion on his face.""
Ahead of the shooting, Tarrant posted a rambling manifesto on social media in which he identified himself by name and described himself as a white supremacist out to avenge attacks in Europe perpetrated by Muslims.
He live-streamed himself as he opened fire in the packed Al Noor mosque during Friday prayers and then travelled across town to continue the carnage in the suburban Linwood mosque.
Tarrant was initially charged with one murder count as a holding measure when he made his first court appearance a day after the killings.
However, the charges were updated Friday to include the names of all 50 who were killed in the attack and 39 others who were wounded.
Tarrant had sacked a court-appointed lawyer after the initial court appearance, raising fears he wanted to represent himself and attempt to use any trial as a right-wing propaganda platform.
However, two Auckland lawyers, Shane Tait and Jonathan Hudson, appeared in court Friday on his behalf.
Judge Mander barred media from filming or photographing proceedings and reiterated an existing ruling that Tarrant s face must be pixillated in images taken during his previous court appearance.
He also ordered the names of the 39 attempted murder victims to be suppressed, saying identifying them could hinder their recovery, and ruled a summary of the prosecution s allegations would not be made public as it contained sensitive information.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has called the mosque killings a well-planned ""terrorist attack"" and taken immediate steps to tighten the country s gun laws.
The government has also said it will review laws dealing with hate speech and called for social media giants to do more to combat online extremism.
The latest update from health authorities earlier this week said 24 people remained in hospital after the attacks, four of them critical, including a four-year-old girl.

"Turkey says US distorted meeting, but Pompeo stands by it","
ANKARA (AFP) - Turkey on Thursday accused the US State Department of making false claims about rows during a meeting between the top US and Turkish diplomats, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he stood by the account.
The NATO allies are at odds over issues including US support for a Syrian Kurdish militia viewed as terrorists by Ankara and Turkey s purchase of a Russian missile system over US objections.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held talks on Wednesday during the Turkish official s visit to Washington as part of 70th anniversary celebrations of the NATO alliance.
The US State Department said Pompeo had warned Ankara of ""potentially devastating consequences"" if Turkey launches an offensive in Syria and urged the ""swift resolution"" of legal cases involving US citizens and US mission employees under investigation in Turkey.
Pompeo also pressed Cavusoglu about Turkey s plans to buy the S-400 missile defence system from Russia, which Washington has warned could put Ankara at risk of US sanctions, the State Department said in a statement.
But Cavusoglu questioned on the issue by reporters in Washington insisted ""I was there... such language was never used, on Syria particularly they never mentioned such things about unilateral actions from Turkey.""
He backed up earlier comments by his foreign ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said the US readout ""not only fails to reflect the content of the meeting, but also contains matters that were not even raised during said meeting"".
It was not clear what ""matters"" Aksoy was referring to in his statement and foreign ministry officials were not immediately available for comment.
Aksoy said similar problems had arisen after previous talks, and urged statements to be prepared with ""greater care"".
Pompeo, asked by reporters about the Turkish comments, insisted that the State Department account was accurate.
""I ve re-read the readout of our meeting. Spot on. Stand by every word of it,"" Pompeo said.
Pompeo said he believed that Turkey ""understands the American position quite clearly"" but said he was hopeful of resolving issues.
""There s great opportunities for the United States and Turkey to work closely together,"" he said. ""I had a good, long conversation with the Turkish foreign minister yesterday and I am very confident we ll find a path forward.""
Ties have been frayed recently by Ankara s purchase of Russian S-400 missiles, which US officials fear have technology that will allow Moscow to gather data from NATO aircraft.
The US wants Turkey to instead opt to buy the US Patriot system.
Washington responded earlier this week by suspending Turkey s participation in the F-35 fighter-jet programme, in which Turkey has invested over $1 billion.

Libya strongman Haftar orders 'advance' on Tripoli,"
TRIPOLI (AFP) - Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar ordered his troops Thursday to ""advance"" on Tripoli, seat of the internationally-recognised unity government, as world powers warned of consequences for military action.
Haftar s forces announced Wednesday they were gearing up for an offensive in the west of the country to purge it of ""terrorists and mercenaries"", having seized key areas of the country s south since the start of the year.
""The time has come,"" Haftar said in an audio message released Thursday by his self-proclaimed Libyan National Army, pledging to spare civilians and ""state institutions"".
Dozens of militias have fought for control of the North African country since a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi in 2011.
Haftar s forces have emerged as a key player, opposing the government in Tripoli and backing a parallel administration in the east.
On Thursday evening LNA spokesman Ahmed Mesmari announced that the force was ""at the gates of the capital"" and said it was not clear whether there would be any resistance from armed groups there.
Unity government chief Fayez al-Sarraj earlier condemned Haftar s ""escalation"" and said he had ordered loyalist forces to prepare to ""face all threats"".
His interior ministry announced a ""state of maximum alert"" and powerful armed groups from Libya s western city of Misrata said they were ready to halt Haftar s advance.
A convoy of vehicles from Haftar s forces on Thursday pushed towards the city of Gharyan, some 100 kilometres (60 miles) from Tripoli, witnesses and military sources said.
Commander Abdessalem Al-Hassi told AFP Thursday that his forces had entered into the city without a fight.
But at least four sources in the city denied this, and a Gharyan official said there were ""ongoing efforts to avoid a confrontation"" between rival fighters who divide the city.
Haftar has repeatedly expressed his intention to march on Tripoli.
His forces in January launched an offensive from his eastern strongholds into oil-rich southern Libya, ostensibly aimed at wiping out ""terrorists"" and criminal groups.
The latest rise in tensions came as United Nations chief Antonio Guterres visited Tripoli ahead of a planned conference later this month to hammer out a roadmap for delayed parliamentary and presidential elections.
""I am deeply concerned by the military movement taking place in Libya and the risk of confrontation,"" Guterres tweeted.
The United States and its allies issued a joint statement urging ""all parties to immediately de-escalate tensions"".
""Our governments oppose any military action in Libya and will hold accountable any Libyan faction that precipitates further civil conflict,"" said the US, France, Britain, Italy and the United Arab Emirates.
""At this sensitive moment in Libya s transition, military posturing and threats of unilateral action only risk propelling Libya back toward chaos.""
The European Union warned that the ""military buildup underway in Libya and the escalatory rhetoric... seriously risks leading to an uncontrollable confrontation"".
The UN Security Council will meet behind closed doors on Friday to discuss Libya, at Britain s request, diplomats said.
Russia, which has courted Haftar, meanwhile called for a solution to Libya s problems through ""political-diplomatic"" means.
Rival Libyan leaders had agreed in Paris last year to hold elections before the end of the year, but that vote never materialised as Haftar s forces and the Tripoli government grappled for power.
The UN said Haftar and Sarraj agreed at a meeting in Abu Dhabi last month to make a new attempt to organise the elections.
Libyan analyst Emad Badi said factions in western Libya were angling for a joint front against the strongman, but ""whatever the result ... Haftar will benefit from it militarily or politically"".
""His progress can enhance his position in the negotiations"" if the UN-backed conference set for this month goes ahead, Badi added.
Jalel Harchaoui, a researcher at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, said that ""taking Tripoli is certainly not an easy or risk-free task, but it s still a possibility.""
""The risk of conflagration has increased,"" he said.

Australia open to return of IS fighter's orphaned children,"
CANBERRA (AFP) - Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Friday he was open to allowing the return of orphaned children of an Australian jihadist in a Syrian refugee camp following their desperate plea for help.
Morrison said his government was working with the Red Cross so the children could leave the Al-Hol camp in northeastern Syria and Australian officials could assess them.
""Where they might be in a position to return to Australia, we will cooperate with that process,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra.
""Where there are Australians who are caught up in this situation, particularly as innocent children, we will do what I think Australians would expect us to do on their behalf.""
The PM added that he would not put ""any Australian life at risk to extract people from these conflict zones"", a stance he has taken in recent weeks despite pleas from their grandmother Karen Nettleton.
Morrison s comments came as Hoda Sharrouf -- the 16-year-old daughter of Australian Islamic State fighter Khaled Sharrouf -- said she was worried about her siblings  health, including 17-year-old sister Zaynab who is seven months pregnant and ""very sick"".
""What about the children? What about the people that didn t want to come here? What about the people that are stuck here and never wanted to be here in the first place? They don t deserve this kind of treatment,"" she told The Sydney Morning Herald from the camp.
""We re Australians too. Australia needs to do something about it. They need to step up,"" she said in an interview published Friday.
The Sydney Morning Herald said there were five children in the family seeking help -- Hoda, Zaynab, their eight-year-old brother Hamzeh, and Zaynab s two young children -- Ayesha, 3, and Fatima, 2.
Sharrouf -- the first Australian to have his citizenship stripped under anti-terrorism laws -- left the country for Syria in 2013 with his wife Tara Nettleton, two daughters and three sons.
He made international headlines in 2014 when he posted an image on Twitter of another son holding a severed head.
He is believed to have died in a 2017 American air strike alongside his then pre-teen sons, while Nettleton reportedly died in 2015.
The fate of foreign fighters and their families has become a significant problem for governments as the conflict against IS draws to a close. Foreigners at the camp are from some 30 to 40 countries.
The Red Cross said Wednesday it wanted hundreds of children of foreign fighters living in the camp to be allowed to return home.
France last month took in five orphans and is dealing with returns on a case-by-case basis.

Taliban kill about 10 Afghan security forces: official,"
KABUL (AFP) - Taliban fighters have killed about 10 security forces in ongoing clashes in Afghanistan s western province of Badghis, an official told AFP on Thursday.
In the latest assault on Afghan forces, who have faced devastating losses in recent years, Taliban fighters smashed through government defence lines near the city of Bala Murghab, capturing several checkpoints.
Jamshid Shahabi, the Badghis provincial governor s spokesman, said ""around 10"" police and soldiers were killed in heavy fighting that started before dawn and continued throughout the day.
The Taliban ""are shelling the main bazaar of the district with mortars -- government forces are fighting back,"" Shahabi said.
In a statement, the defence ministry said Afghan forces had made a ""tactical retreat"" from a number of checkpoints in the district to ""avoid civilian casualties"".
Abdul Aziz Beg, the head of the Badghis provincial council, described the situation as ""critical"".
""If reinforcements are not urgently deployed, a catastrophe could happen in Bala Murghab district,"" Beg said.
The Taliban said they had conducted a coordinated attack on a series of government checkpoints, killing 12 security forces.
The clash comes as Zalmay Khalilzad, the US envoy tasked with forging a peace deal with the Taliban, is concluding a week-long visit to Afghanistan, where he has spoken to national leaders and stakeholders across the country.
In January, President Ashraf Ghani said 45,000 security forces had been killed since he took office in September 2014.

Britain's May ever more isolated in Brexit endgame,"
LONDON (AFP) - Prime Minister Theresa May s cuts an increasingly lonely figure after her decision this week to turn to opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to break the Brexit deadlock sparked a torrent of criticism from Conservatives.
The beleaguered leader wrote to Tory MPs on Wednesday to insist that several dozen Tories  stubborn resistance to her EU divorce deal had left her with little choice but to look to Labour for support.
Britain is set to crash out of the European Union at the end of next week if it has not passed May s withdrawal agreement or found a viable alternative plan.
""This is the only way to deliver the smooth, orderly Brexit that we promised,"" May said in her letter, in which she also reneged on previous pledges to leave without a deal if necessary.
The outreach to veteran leftist Corbyn, a reviled figure among British Conservatives and right-wingers who label him a Marxist, has drawn fury from eurosceptics in her party.
Corbyn wants to maintain closer ties with the EU than May through customs union membership and close alignment with the bloc s single market.
That is anathema to Brexiteers, with lawmaker Mark Francois telling her ""Jeremy Corbyn is not our friend"" and former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith MP accusing the prime minister of ""betrayal"".
""I fear for Brexit, it s never going to happen,"" he said.
Britain s right-wing newspapers joined in.
Tabloid The Sun labelled May a ""traitor"" on Thursday, while The Times said ""she s like a prisoner on death row, getting another two-week reprieve.
""The truth is she is no longer in control of events,"" it added.
The hemorrhaging within May s government has been steady since the general election of June, 2017, which she called but which resulted in her party losing its parliamentary majority.
More than 30 ministers have resigned -- with two more departing this week in protest at her pivot toward Labour -- and the prime minister has been increasingly slow in replacing them.
Downing Street on Thursday finally announced six new names for positions that had, in some cases, been vacant for weeks.
""Not even her cabinet can now look her in the eye,"" The Guardian columnist John Grace wrote.
""She has never been loved but there had been grudging respect for her resilience. Now there was just hatred.""
Paul Breen, a senior lecturer at the University of Westminster, London, said May has ""lost everybody"" at this point.
But he reserves blame for David Cameron, her predecessor as PM who called the referendum on European Union membership in 2016 and then quit when the result went against him, and the Conservative Party.
""It s such a contentious issue they should have created some sort of... group of people like lawyers, economists, business people, to look at the different options,"" Breen said.
Instead, in the aftermath of the divisive poll, May set out a series of unnegotiable ""red lines"" on key Brexit issues in an apparent bid to please Brexiteers.
But when the overall deal failed to satisfy enough of these eurosceptics, her hardline stances came back to haunt her.
""She s like a football manager who has lost the dressing room,"" said Breen.
""Once that happens that s it, you re finished.""

"Amazon's Bezos, ex-wife reach biggest divorce deal in history","
NEW YORK (AFP) - Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his ex-wife, MacKenzie, finalized the biggest divorce settlement in history on Thursday, leaving him with 75 percent of their stock in the tech giant and giving her nearly $36 billion in shares.
MacKenzie Bezos said she would give all of her stake in The Washington Post and the space exploration firm Blue Origin to her ex-husband -- the world s richest man -- as well as voting control of her remaining Amazon stock.
Jeff Bezos, 55, and MacKenzie, 48, a novelist, married in 1993 and have four children. Jeff Bezos founded Amazon in their Seattle garage in 1994 and turned it into a colossus that dominates online retail.
In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Amazon, which has a market capitalization of some $890 billion, said MacKenzie Bezos will control four percent of the company s outstanding common stock.
At Amazon s current share price that would be worth some $35.6 billion.
According to Forbes magazine, the divorce settlement makes MacKenzie Bezos the third wealthiest woman in the world after L Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers and Walmart s Alice Walton.
Jeff Bezos, who now owns 12 percent of Amazon, remains the world s richest man and the largest shareholder in the company with an estimated fortune of $110 billion, Forbes said, ahead of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett.
Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos announced their separation in January and posted Twitter messages on Thursday revealing the divorce settlement.
""Grateful to have finished the process of dissolving my marriage with Jeff with support from each other and everyone who reached out to us in kindness,"" MacKenzie Bezos wrote.
""Happy to be giving him all of my interests in the Washington Post and Blue Origin, and 75% of our Amazon stock plus voting control of my shares to support his continued contributions with the teams of these incredible companies,"" MacKenzie Bezos said.
""Excited about my own plans. Grateful for the past as I look forward to what comes next,"" she said.
Jeff Bezos, in a Twitter message of his own, said his now ex-wife has been ""an extraordinary partner, ally, and mother.""
""She is resourceful and brilliant and loving, and as our futures unroll, I know I ll always be learning from her,"" he said.
""I m grateful for her support and for her kindness in this process and am very much looking forward to our new relationship as friends and co-parents,"" Bezos added.
Bezos has largely kept his personal life private during his years steering Amazon.
But it was thrust into the spotlight with the announcement in January that he and his wife were divorcing after 25 years of marriage and the revelation by the National Enquirer that he had been having an affair with a former news anchor, Lauren Sanchez.
When the National Enquirer, controlled by President Donald Trump s ally David Pecker, threatened to release lurid, intimate pictures of Bezos and Sanchez, Bezos fought back by releasing the details of his exchanges publicly.
""Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I ve decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten,"" Bezos wrote in a blog post.
A lawyer for the National Enquirer denied that the supermarket tabloid had tried to extort and blackmail the Amazon founder.
Trump has been a frequent critic of the Post, which Bezos purchased in 2013, claiming that the newspaper is biased against him and calling it the ""Amazon Washington Post.""
Amazon shares were down 0.28 percent at $1,815.69 in New York on Thursday shortly before the close of trading.

"Israel was behind coup against Egypt's Morsi, admits Israelis general","
(Web Desk) – Israel worked to overthrow Egypt’s first democratically elected President, Mohamed Morsi, and to orchestrate a coup against him in 2013, Israeli army Brigadier General Aryeh Eldad said.
According to an article published in Maariv newspaper that “the outbreak of the January revolution coincided with the Israeli security assessment that President-elect Mohamed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood man, intended to cancel the peace agreement with Israel and send more Egyptian military forces to the Sinai Peninsula.”
“At that stage, Israel was quick and willing to activate its diplomatic tools, and perhaps even greater means, to bring Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi to power in Egypt, and convince the then US administration under President Barack Obama not to oppose this move.”
Eldad stressed that “contrary to all Israeli expectations, the Camp David agreement, which was made 40 years ago, has lasted for many decades despite the lack of real peace between us and the Egyptians, and despite the failure to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, because this conflict is not just geopolitical. We are rather having a religious war with the Palestinians and Arabs.”
He stated that “the stir caused by Israel’s sale of German submarines to Egypt in conjunction with the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the Camp David agreement is a new indication that we adhere to having Egypt on our side. And today, 40 years after the Camp David agreement, we reached the conclusion that Israel is fighting shoulder to shoulder.”
Eldad pointed out that “it is too early to talk about the usefulness of the peace agreement with Egypt, 40 years after the signing of the Camp David agreement in 1979, and contrary to the expectations that were issued when it was made, the agreement was able to withstand and continue, but opponents of the withdrawal from Sinai were not wrong then, because we did not have a real peace with Egypt.”
He added that “the Camp David agreement is the first of its kind between Israel and a hostile Arab state, which was then the largest and most dangerous Arab country. It resulted in the withdrawal until the last millimetre according to the international border between Egypt and Israel, knowing that I did not expect that Sadat would fulfil his commitment to the peace agreement with Israel, but I was wrong, too.”

NATO seeks new ways to counter Russia 'aggression',"
(AFP) – The 29 NATO nations looked Thursday for new ways to counter what they described as rising aggression by Russia as the alliance celebrated its 70th birthday.
Despite rifts between the United States with allies Germany and Turkey, foreign ministers from the Western alliance were looking to show a united front on NATO s core concern -- Russia.
After years of focusing on more faraway challenges such as Afghanistan, NATO allies in recent years have increasingly voiced worry about the trajectory of Russia under President Vladimir Putin.
Russia in 2014 seized the Crimean peninsula and has backed separatists in both Georgia and Ukraine, besides seeking to influence Western elections and being suspected in a poisoning attack in England.
""We will agree on new measures of support for our close partners Georgia and Ukraine,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters ahead of Thursday s session.
He said that NATO would also address ""the aggressive actions of Russia"" in the Black Sea.
Russia -- which has resented NATO s eastward expansion -- in November fired on and seized three Ukrainian navy vessels, capturing two dozen sailors, near the Kerch Strait off Crimea.
Kay Bailey Hutchison, the US ambassador to NATO, earlier said that the alliance was preparing a package to ""assure that there is safe passage for Ukrainian vessels through the Kerch Strait.""
She said that NATO allies would send more ships to the area to ensure that ""countries in and around the Black Sea are safe from Russian meddling.""

 The Eastern threat 

Russia criticized the Black Sea plan and, in a statement for the NATO anniversary, voiced regret that the alliance ""has no intention to renounce its political and military confrontation with Russia.""
""It is time to stop bringing back the  Eastern threat.  In the interest of peace, the world needs a de-escalation of military and political tensions,"" the foreign ministry said.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, opening a session with the ministers, said NATO needed to confront ""Russian aggression"" but also ""emerging threats"" including the rise of China as well as Iran.
The United States has enjoyed less support over those two issues, with all of its NATO allies backing an international accord on ending Iran s nuclear program from which President Donald Trump withdrew.
Pompeo has also been seeking with limited success to persuade US allies not to choose Chinese telecom giant Huawei for their fifth-generation networks, warning that the company poses risks to security and personal privacy.
The Trump administration has been livid at Germany, Europe s largest economy, for its budgetary plans that do not come close to the NATO goal of spending two percent on defense spending.
""Now is not the time to repeat tired excuses that our citizens don t support increased defense or security spending. Each nation has the duty to make the case to our people,"" Pompeo said.
NATO allies have also seen rising friction with Turkey, which has been clamping down on dissent and has defiantly insisted on buying a major missile defense system from Russia, even after the United States suspended its participation in the F-35 fighter-jet program.
But the NATO meeting is also witnessing the end to one long-running standoff with the participation of the foreign minister of North Macedonia.
The former Yugoslav republic had been in limbo for years, with Greece objecting to the name of Macedonia, which is historically tied to Hellenic rather than Slavic civilization.
Greece s left-wing prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, brokered a deal to welcome the country after it changed its name to North Macedonia and it is expected to enter NATO as its 30th member later this year.
Greek Foreign Minister Georgios Katrougalos, speaking at a forum in Washington on Wednesday, said the deal can be a ""blueprint"" for resolving conflicts as leaders need not see ""history as a prison.""

"Congress ends US support for Yemen war, Trump likely to veto","
WASHINGTON (AFP) - US lawmakers voted Thursday to end military support for the bloody Saudi-led war in Yemen, dealing a harsh bipartisan rebuke to Donald Trump and taking the historic step of curtailing a president s war-making powers.
The House of Representatives voted 247 to 175, with one congressman voting present, to approve a resolution that directs the president ""to remove United States Armed Forces from hostilities in or affecting the Republic of Yemen"" within 30 days.
The text cleared the Senate last month and now heads to Trump, who is expected to veto the legislation.
The White House has called the measure ""flawed"" and warned it would harm bilateral relations in the region, including with Saudi Arabia.
But the passage through Congress marked a historic milestone, as it was the first time in history that a measure invoking the 1973 War Powers Resolution will reach the president s desk.
Several Democrats have argued that the US involvement in the Saudi-led coalition fighting Huthi rebels -- mainly through the provision of military aid such as the refueling of aircraft -- is unconstitutional without congressional authority, and they have sought for months to reclaim US lawmakers  constitutional authority to declare war.
""Today we took a clear stand against war and famine and for Congress s war powers by voting to end our complicity in the war in Yemen,"" Senator Bernie Sanders, a lead author of the resolution and a 2020 presidential candidate, said after the House vote.
""The president will have to face the reality that Congress is no longer going to ignore its constitutional obligations with regard to foreign policy,"" House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Eliot Engel told the chamber.
 
- Rare bipartisanship -
 
At least 15 House Republicans joined Democrats in defying Trump on Yemen, where critics of American intervention have warned that Saudi forces are likely using US weapons to commit atrocities.
The war in Yemen is the world s worst humanitarian crisis, with an estimated 14 million people at risk of famine.
The World Health Organization says about 10,000 people have been killed in the war between forces loyal to the Yemeni government, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, and the Iran-aligned Huthi rebels. Rights groups say the death toll is far higher.
The United States provides weapons and refueling to the Saudi coalition.
The resolution is a reminder that Congress has the legal ability to compel the removal of US military forces, absent a formal declaration of war.
It is also likely to trigger the second veto of Trump s presidency. Last month he overrode a congressional resolution that aimed to reverse the border emergency that he declared in order to secure more funding for his wall between the United States and Mexico.
The Yemen vote, and the rare bipartisanship at the heart of it, came as US lawmakers have escalated their opposition to Saudi Arabia after the October murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom s consulate in Istanbul.
Republicans and Democrats alike have bristled over the White House s apparent embrace of the kingdom and its leadership.
Some members of Congress have publicly stated that they suspect that powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was directly responsible for the killing, based on the CIA s conclusions.
But congressman Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the foreign affairs panel, warned the resolution does ""nothing"" to address the humanitarian crisis in Yemen or deliver justice for Khashoggi s murder.

Global life expectancy up 5.5 years since 2000: WHO,"
GENEVA (AFP) - Global life expectancy grew by 5.5 years between 2000 and 2016, the World Health Organization said Thursday, warning though that unequal income and access to healthcare translates into far shorter lives for many.
The UN health agency also stressed significant gender differences in life expectancy worldwide.
On average, a child born in 2016 can expect to live 72 years, up from 66.5 in 2000, according to the annual World Health Statistics report.
The first 16 years of the century saw dramatic drops in deaths among children under five, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where progress has been made against malaria, measles and other communicable diseases, WHO said.
Life expectancy has also increased thanks to advances against HIV/AIDS, which ravaged much of Africa in the 1990s.
But despite progress in poorer countries, WHO said there remained significant life expectancy gaps between developed and developing nations.
People in low-income countries live 18 fewer years on average than those in high-income nations, statistics showed.
In Lesotho, for instance, people on average live to be just 52, or 53 in the Central African Republic 53 years of age, compared to over 83 for Switzerland and over 84 in Japan.
While most people who die in rich countries are old, nearly one in three deaths in poorer countries are children under five, WHO said.
 
-  Shocking differences  -
 
For the first time, WHO broke down its global health statistics by sex, clearly showing that females have better longevity prospects than males.
At birth, babies are more likely to be male than female, with some 73 million boys expected to be born this year, compared to 68 million girls, WHO said.
But due to greater biological frailty and riskier behaviours, mortality rates tend to be higher among boys and men, and the ratio shifts as the population ages.
At a global scale, girls born in 2016 are expected to live to the age of 74.2, while and boys on average will make it to 69.8 years, the report showed.
One reason why women appear to live longer is that they tend to be better about using available healthcare.
In countries facing HIV epidemics, for instance, women are far more likely to take HIV tests and access antiretroviral therapies than their male counterparts. Female TB patients are also more likely to seek treatment, WHO said.
It is therefore perhaps not surprising that the gap between men s and women s life expectancy is narrowest in places where women lack access to health services.
In low-income countries with scarcer services, one in 41 women die from maternal causes, compared to one in 3,300 women in high-income countries.
These are ""shocking differences"", WHO s head of data and analytics, Samira Asma, told reporters.
Overall, the statistics showed that life expectancy has risen in most countries, including significant jumps in places like Eritrea, where people on average are now expected to live 22 years longer than the 43 years predicted in 2000.
In Syria, meanwhile, which has been ravaged by eight years of conflict, life expectancy dropped by a decade, from 73 years in 2000 to 63.8 years in 2016.
People in the United States have meanwhile seen their life expectancy slip from 79 years in 2014 to 78.5 years two years later, the WHO numbers showed.
Asma said the drop was in part driven by the obesity epidemic.

India bans civilian movement on highway in Occupied Kashmir,"
SRINAGAR (Web Desk) – Authorities in Indian-held Kashmir have banned movement of civilian traffic on the Srinagar-Jammu Highway for two days every week.
According to Kashmir Media Service, the authorities have notified Sunday and Wednesday in a week for the movement of Indian forces’ personnel from Srinagar to Jammu. During these days, no civilian traffic would be allowed on the highway from 4:00am to 5:00pm, he added.
This prohibition would be from Baramulla through Srinagar, Qazigund, Jawahar Tunnel, Banihal and Ramban till Udhampur.
“These restrictions would remain in force till May 31, 2019,” a spokesperson said.
Condemning the move, All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) Chairman Syed Ali Gilani said that caging the entire population in their houses to facilitate the uninterrupted movement of Indian is shameful and humiliating violation of fundamental rights.
Gilani said after creating graveyards in length and breadth of the territory, rulers in Delhi very brazenly try to strangulate the common people, which can have catastrophic ramifications.
He said that power intoxicated Indian ruling class should bear in mind that Jammu and Kashmir was not their property and its people were not their slaves and whenever and whatever they want they will be free to do so.
The APHC chairman said that roads were means of connectivity and were not only used in normal life, but were of prime importance in some desperate and emergency situations. “Curtailing and banning such a basic and fundamental lifeline amounts to an unforgivable crime against helpless population.”
The pro-freedom leader said that souls of Changaze and Halaku might also have been surprised to hear such ridiculous and foolish announcements coming off and on from the mindless rulers. “It is better that they close all educational institutions, healthcare system, offices, universities and seal the residences, so that only their armed forces can roam around.”
Syed Ali Gilani said that world’s worst dictators might also not have done such inhuman actions, which the saffron brigade very cunningly and brazenly did, weaving a deceitful mask of so-called democracy.
The octogenarian leader deplored that a permanent resident of Kashmir now needed to take the permission from the outsider to use its own land. “Caging the entire population in their houses to facilitate the smooth and uninterrupted forces movement is not only shameful, but is gross and humiliating violation of one’s basic and fundamental rights,” he added.
He to appealed human rights bodies, peace-loving people, particularly Indian intelligentsia and conscious citizens to come forward and rescue the helpless Kashmiri people.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-04-19/news_big_images/485475_16993927.jpg,world
Putin says body of missing Israeli soldier found by Russian army,"
MOSCOW (AFP) - The body of an Israeli soldier missing since the 1982 Lebanon War was found by the Russian and Syrian armies, President Vladimir Putin said Thursday.
Sergeant First Class Zachary Baumel had been listed as missing along with two other Israeli soldiers in a deadly battle with Syrian forces in a Lebanese village, and the return of his remains will bring to a close a highly sensitive case for Israelis.
Putin made the revelation at a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is visiting Moscow five days before he is to seek a fifth term in office in a difficult election.
Netanyahu, 69, is running in the April 9 vote despite facing potential corruption charges and experts said he hopes the Moscow visit would increase his chances of success on election day.
""Our military together with Syrian partners found the place of his burial,"" Putin said of Baumel.
""We are very happy that he will be able to receive the right military honors in his homeland.""
Netanyahu said Baumel would be laid to rest at a ""very moving"" ceremony in Israel later Thursday.
""Zachary’s friends and family will take part,"" he said, adding that his family had been ""very touched"".
""His father is no longer alive, unfortunately,"" he added. ""His mother is around 100 years old. Zachary also has a sister.""
Neither Putin nor Israel have given details on how or where the remains were found.
Putin said only that Syria - with which Israel has technically been at war - participated in the operation.
‘Risking their lives’
Netanyahu’s spokesman posted photographs on Twitter showing a ceremony in the Russian defence ministry handing over the remains to Netanyahu on Thursday.
""Russia has handed over to Israel the remains of a member of a tank battalion, Zachary Baumel, missing for over 37 years,"" the ministry said in a statement.
The Israeli army had announced Wednesday that the body had already been recovered and returned to the country.
According to translated comments published on the Kremlin website, Netanyahu said ""Russian fighters, risking their lives, brought Zachary’s remains to Israeli territory.""
But Putin said Thursday: ""The remains are with us and, in accordance to military tradition, we will send them to Israel with your participation.""
Putin said ""it was not easy"" for Russian Special Forces to find the remains. He added that ""all the necessary genetic tests have been completed"".
He said he valued Netanyahu’s ""attitude to the memory of Red Army soldiers"", adding that Baumel shared the same fate as thousands of Soviet soldiers who went missing during World War II.
‘We will not forget this’
Baumel, who was born in the US in 1960 but immigrated to Israel, had been missing since what is known as the Battle of Sultan Yacoub in a Lebanese village of the same name near the Syrian border. Some 20 Israeli soldiers were killed in the fight.
Tank driver Baumel and two other soldiers, Zvi Feldman and Yehuda Katz, had been listed as missing and presumed dead. The other two remain missing.
Netanyahu said he asked Putin two years ago to help in the search for the remains of the missing men.
""You personally responded and gave the order to help in this holy deed,"" he said, thanking the Russian leader.
""We will not forget this act, it will go down in history.""
The return of the remains of soldiers missing in action is a highly important issue in Israel, which has fought repeated wars with its Arab neighbors since the state of Israel was established in 1948.

Saudi Arabia grants Iraq loans as consulate opens,"
BAGHDAD (AFP) - Saudi Arabia’s trade minister announced a one-billion-dollar aid package for Iraq during a visit to Baghdad on Thursday, pledging stronger bilateral ties as the kingdom competes with rival Iran for influence over Iraq.
Majed al-Qasabi also inaugurated a new Saudi consulate in Baghdad, one of four planned branches to open in Iraq after decades of no diplomatic links between the two countries.
Speaking to reporters alongside Iraqi Oil Minister Thamer Ghadban, Qasabi said the relationship had entered ""a new phase"".
""There’s no doubt that this exchange, this discussion, is a two-way street that will strengthen these ties,"" said Qasabi, wrapping up a two-day visit.
Saudi Arabia would provide Iraq with $1 billion in loans for development projects, said Qasabi, plus $500 million to boost exports and a gift of a 100,000-seat sports stadium to be built on Baghdad’s outskirts.
A joint Saudi-Iraq business council also proposed dozens of opportunities in Iraq for Saudi private investors and a free trade zone along the desertic border between the two countries, he said.
Ghadban said the council had prepared ""memoranda of understanding that will be signed in Riyadh during the upcoming visit of Iraq s prime minister.""
He said the trip would take place in the ""coming days,"" but Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi is set to travel to Iran on Saturday.
Iraq is caught in a tug-of-war over influence pitting Iran against the United States and Saudi Arabia.
Iran is the second-largest supplier of imported goods to Iraq and also has deep-rooted political influence in the country, particularly over Shiite factions.
But Tehran’s top foes Riyadh and Washington are seeking to increase their sway in Baghdad, including through trade.
Last year, Washington urged Baghdad to partner with US firms instead of relying on Iranian gas and electricity, key crutches for Iraq s faltering power sector.
Riyadh, too, has looked into providing electricity to Iraq through solar power and hosted Iraqi President Barham Salih last year, a major step in the bilateral relationship.
Saudi Arabia cut off ties with Iraq after former dictator Saddam Hussein’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait and only reopened its embassy in Baghdad in 2016.
But eight months later, the newly arrived ambassador was recalled to Riyadh in protest over the influence of Iran-backed Shiite militias in Iraq.
Iraqis had to travel to neighboring Jordan to apply for a Saudi visa, until the consulate opening on Thursday.
""Today, our brothers in Iraq can acquire a visa in Baghdad directly, without having to suffer a trip abroad,"" Qasabi said outside the consulate.

UN chief deeply concerned by military escalation in Libya,"
TRIPOLI (AFP) - UN chief Antonio Guterres expressed deep concern Thursday over the risk of confrontation in Libya after forces loyal to a controversial strongman announced they were preparing to advance on Tripoli.
""I am deeply concerned by the military movement taking place in Libya and the risk of confrontation,"" the visiting Guterres tweeted from the capital, which is controlled by a UN-backed unity government.
""There is no military solution,"" he added.
Dozens of militias have fought for control of the North African country since a NATO-backed uprising toppled longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi in 2011.
But the self-proclaimed Libyan National Army of Khalifa Haftar has emerged as a key player, opposing the government in Tripoli and backing a parallel administration in the east.
Haftar launched an offensive into oil-producing regions of southern Libya in January ostensibly aimed at wiping out ""terrorists"" and criminal groups.
He has repeatedly expressed his intention to march on Tripoli.
LNA spokesman Ahmed Mesmari said at a press conference on Wednesday that ""preparations are on the point of being completed... to purge the west of terrorists and mercenaries"".
Unity government chief Fayez al-Sarraj called the move an ""escalation"" and urged Haftar s forces to ""stop using the language of threats"".
He said he had ordered pro-government forces to prepare to ""face all threats... whether from terrorist groups, criminals, outlaws and all who threaten the security of every Libyan city"".
The bellicose comments from Haftar s forces come as the United Nations prepares to convene a conference later this month to hammer out a roadmap for delayed parliamentary and presidential elections.
""Only intra-Libyan dialogue can solve Libyan problems,"" Guterres said on Thursday.
""I call for calm and restraint as I prepare to meet the Libyan leaders in the country.""
The rival leaders had agreed in Paris last year to hold elections before the end of the year, but that vote never materialised as Haftar s forces and the Tripoli government grappled for power.
The UN has said Haftar and Sarraj agreed at a meeting in Abu Dhabi last month to make a new attempt to organise the elections.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-04-19/news_big_images/485452_89974412.jpg,world
Swedish companies offer smart solutions to urban challenges in Pakistan ,"
KARACHI (Dunya News) – Effects from climate change, urbanisation and a growing middle-class exert pressure on water, transportation and energy supplies in Pakistan’s cities. Meanwhile, Sweden is a world leader in innovation, start-ups and sustainable business, with green technologies that form the building blocks of a smart city. So, how can sustainable Swedish solutions help Pakistan meet its urban challenges? 
These issues were in focus at the business event “Smart Cities & Digital Transformation” at the National Incubation Center in Karachi, Friday April 5th. The Swedish illusionist Charlie Caper opened the event with a futuristic show on robotic technology, setting the tone for the following discussions on innovation for a sustainable future. Swedish companies and business entrepreneurs presented their solutions to areas such as water and waste management, clean air and energy, and IoT and connectivity. 
Business Sweden, the Swedish Trade and Invest Council, presented the “Smart City Sweden” platform – a gateway to Swedish companies working in all areas of urban development. The Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and Higher Education (STINT) shared their perspective on academia’s internationalisation and key role in innovation. 
“Today’s event presents smart Swedish solutions to Pakistan’s urban challenges, and displays how Sweden’s industry, academia and government collaborate in clusters that produce start-ups and innovations for sustainable growth. I look forward to increased trade and knowledge-sharing between Sweden and Pakistan”, said Ingrid Johansson, Ambassador of Sweden in Pakistan. 
“It was an absolute pleasure to have Ms. Ingrid Johansson, Ambassador of Sweden in Pakistan, Government Officials, and key stake holders join us at the Smart Cities and Digital Transformation event at National Incubation Center Karachi - the city s innovative hub of technology. The event offered valuable insights into Swedish technological solutions for urban challenges leading to digital innovation in lifestyle, infrastructure and society, which will help Pakistan in defining its future course”, said Atif Rais Khan, CEO LMKT.
Stakeholders from the Pakistani business sector, including representatives from the Pakistan’s Stock Exchange, the Prime Minister’s Council of Business Leaders and Secretary, Sindh Investment Department discussed key areas for Swedish solutions in Pakistan and how ease of doing business could promote such investments.

No-deal Brexit may have steep costs for some sectors: WTO chief,"
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a deal it could have “very significant” costs for some parts of the British economy, Roberto Azevedo, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), said on Thursday.
The British government is scrambling to find parliamentary consensus over the terms of its departure from the European Union ahead of an April 12 deadline, prompting warnings from some officials that the risk of a no-deal exit is increasing.
Azevedo said in Mexico City that economists were best placed to estimate the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit, which would leave the British economy trading on WTO rules.
“But I would say there will be costs, and the costs may be very significant in some sectors, and maybe less significant in other sectors. But overall, there will be an impact, we all know that,” he told Reuters in an interview.
Separately, Azevedo sounded a note of caution on ongoing efforts to resolve a dispute over the future of the WTO’s Appellate Body, the top court of global trade.
Washington has long argued that WTO judges have routinely broken with procedures and exceeded their mandates, and in a bid to force reforms, the U.S. government has blocked the appointment of judges to the Appellate Body.
If continued, the tactic could render the body inoperable by December, when terms end for two of the remaining three judges. Under WTO rules, three judges are required to hear appeals.
Azevedo said WTO member states were seeking to find a way around the impasse, noting that it was chiefly a U.S. concern.
“The truth is that it’s difficult to know if we’re advancing or not,” he said, “because the Americans haven’t been contributing in a very active way to these discussions.” ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-05-19/news_big_images/485551_89571558.jpg,business
"As new emperor arrives, Japan remembers bygone boom era","
TOKYO (AFP) - ""Money dripping off trees"": that was the sentiment in Tokyo the last time a new emperor took the throne, at the height of Japan’s economic boom. But things have changed.
As Emperor Akihito prepares to step aside and make way for his son Crown Prince Naruhito, the boom time excesses have long gone, replaced by lingering worry about stagnation in the world’s third-largest economy.
From the ashes of World War II, Japan witnessed what was dubbed an economic ""miracle"", fuelled by innovative electronic goods, that reached its pinnacle in the late 1980s.
Flush with cash, Japanese investors snapped up paintings like Van Gogh’s ""Sunflowers"" and US landmarks including the Rockefeller Centre in Manhattan.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange’s benchmark Nikkei index rallied to near 39,000 at the end of 1989, the first year of the Heisei era that will end with Akihito’s abdication on April 30.
Three decades ago, soaring land prices sparked wild cost comparisons: the Imperial Palace grounds were worth more than all of Canada, and Tokyo and its three surrounding prefectures worth more than the entire United States of America.
""It was an enormous asset bubble. It was a surreal world,"" said former banker Tag Murphy.
""It felt as if money was dripping off trees,"" he told AFP.
But as Naruhito prepares to ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne on May 1, the Nikkei has lost nearly half its peak value to hover around 21,000 and the central bank is waging a years-long losing battle against deflation.

‘Abnormal’

In the boom days, landowners made a fortune and bankers like Murphy had more business than they could handle.
Bottles of Dom Perignon and Romanee-Conti were popped open one after another at bars in the swanky Ginza district, and it was often impossible to find an empty taxi at night.
Atsushi Saito, a former executive at top brokerage Nomura Securities, remembers Wall Street giants like Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley expressing alarm as the Japanese advanced.
""They asked me, ‘What’s the end goal? Conquering the world?’ They were very afraid of Japanese financial firms,"" he told reporters last year.
Japanese corporate management was considered ""something like magic,"" said Koichi Haji, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute.
""People were even talking about Japan’s economy overtaking America’s,"" he told AFP, describing the situation as ""abnormal.""
But it all came crashing down when inflated property prices collapsed and the bubble burst in the early 1990s.
Nomura employees were told to take off corporate lapel pins to ward off attacks by furious investors who had lost money, said one former senior manager at the company.
A truck filled with human excrement was rammed into a Nomura office. Executives wore bullet-proof vests for months, according to the former employee, who said he kept the blinds in his office closed during the day.

Need for reform

Japan Inc. has never regained its glory, and the country is now struggling with a string of challenges ranging from a rapidly ageing population to innovation woes.
""Ideas that would cause pain but bring about reforms for the future are deeply unpopular,"" said Saito, who believes Japan needs global mergers and acquisitions, and stronger measures to attract foreign talent.
The country is also struggling to boost domestic demand and reform an entrenched system of life-time employment that Murphy describes as a ""labour aristocracy.""
Experts also point to a relatively slow uptake on digitalisation in manufacturing, and a preference for goods over services.
There have been small signs of inflation, with delivery company Yamato announcing in 2017 its first price increase for retail customers in 27 years.
""It was wrong to believe that loose monetary policy would rehabilitate the economy,"" said Haji at NLI, referring to a years-long programme by the central bank that has barely moved the needle on inflation.
""We must admit that we don’t really know that the cause of this sickness is,"" he adding, saying that a widening gap between the rich and poor, and worries over the future, could be factors. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-05-19/news_big_images/485548_38966368.jpg,business
Jeff Bezos keeps Amazon voting power in divorce settlement,"
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos will retain voting control of his entire $143 billion stake in the company under a divorce settlement with his wife, MacKenzie Bezos, who will own 25 percent of those shares, the couple said on Thursday, removing uncertainty over control of the online retailer.
The world’s richest couple had announced their impending divorce in a joint Twitter statement in January, causing some to worry that Jeff Bezos could wind up with less Amazon voting power or that he or MacKenzie would liquidate large positions.
“It takes the issue off the table, with less turbulence than you might have expected,” said an investor, whose company owns several million dollars worth of Amazon shares but who asked for anonymity because of a firm policy.
MacKenzie Bezos will wind up with a stake in Amazon that is worth roughly $36 billion (27 billion pounds). Her shares represent a 4 percent stake in Amazon, according to a regulatory filing by the company. The Amazon shares will make her the world’s third-richest woman while Jeff Bezos will remain the world’s richest person, according to Forbes.
The couple, who tweeted separately on Thursday, disclosed that under their settlement MacKenzie will give up her interests in the Washington Post, which Jeff Bezos bought in 2013 and which has been a frequent target of criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump, and the rocket company Blue Origin he founded in 2000.
“Grateful to have finished the process of dissolving my marriage with Jeff,” MacKenzie Bezos said in her tweet outlining the agreement, the first and only post from an account created this month.
The two did not provide any further financial details about the settlement.

“INFLUENCE WOULD BE THE SAME”

Amazon, the world’s biggest online retailer, said in the filing that 4 percent of its outstanding shares would be registered in MacKenzie Bezos’ name after court approval of the divorce, which is expected to occur in about 90 days.
The petition for divorce was filed in Washington state, a person familiar with the matter said.
Jeff Bezos, whom Amazon listed in its most recent proxy statement as its single largest shareholder with a 16.3 percent stake, will keep sole voting authority over the shares unless MacKenzie donates them to a nonprofit or sells them in the open market.
Amazon shares closed down 0.1 percent at $1,818.86.
Jeff Bezos, 55, is seen as essential to Amazon’s meteoric growth and stock price rise since he founded the company as an online bookseller in 1994. He has credited MacKenzie, 48, for her support when he uprooted the young couple to Seattle from New York to launch Amazon.
“When I think about Amazon, and the influence Bezos has on Amazon, I would argue his influence would be the same if he had 51 percent shares outstanding or 1 percent. I think his influence is dictated by his vision for Amazon,” D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said.
MacKenzie Bezos’ stake in Amazon is worth more than the market values of nearly 70 percent of the components of the S&P 500.
The settlement suggests that Amazon will be spared the kind of boardroom battle that has plagued other companies whose owners are dealing with family rifts, even though the divorce had jolted the once-private Bezos couple into the public spotlight.
Jeff Bezos re-tweeted MacKenzie’s statement and added in a separate post that he was grateful “for her support and for her kindness in this process.”
Liat Sadler, a San Francisco matrimonial lawyer, said the settlement should put investors at ease.
“They’ve done a lot of work behind the scenes to make their breakup as amicable as it seems,” she said. Still, Sadler added, “Without knowing what cash she received, I have no idea how favourable it was to him or not.”

Fighting graft boosts tax revenues: IMF,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - Reducing corruption allows governments to collect more in taxes, according to a study published Thursday by the International Monetary Fund.
The global crisis lender estimates that, among advanced economies, those that best combat graft collect on average 4.5 percent more in tax revenue as a share of GDP than those most beset by corruption.
""The annual cost of bribery alone is over $1.5 trillion, roughly two percent of global GDP,"" IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said Tuesday in remarks previewing next week s spring meetings with the World Bank.
""Money laundering and the financing of terrorism are other serious dimensions of the problem, where the IMF has been working with over 100 countries.""
Allowing corruption also results in lower public spending on education and health, said the authors of the report released Thursday, noting that this was particularly acute among low-income and emerging economies.
Commonplace corruption is hardest to eradicate, entrapping cities and even countries in pervasive venality, they added.
""A public official will be more tempted to accept a bribe when  everyone  takes bribes,"" the report found, noting that the reverse was also true.
As instances of corruption grow scarce, the temptation to accept a bribe weakens as officials increasingly fear being caught.
""Thus, escaping the trap of high corruption is difficult,"" the report s authors say, citing Georgia, Liberia and Rwanda as having made progress over a relatively short period.
Georgia had been ranked among the most corrupt nations in the world until 2003. But by 2008 combating graft there had boosted tax revenues to 25 percent of Gross Domestic Product from 12 percent, according to the report.
A year ago, the IMF said it had adopted a new framework to evaluate corruption more systematically among its 189 member countries.
In addition to assessing the nature and gravity of corruption and scrutinizing governance, the fund said it would review local government measures meant to prevent bribery and embezzlement.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-04-19/news_big_images/485499_20417783.jpg,business
"FBR selects 14,154 cases for audit for tax year 2018 ","
ISLAMABAD (APP) – Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on Thursday selected 14,154 cases of income tax, sales tax and federal excise duty (FED) for audit through an electronic balloting for tax year 2018.
In a ceremony for risk based selection of cases for audit held here, the FBR selected 477,374 income tax payers for balloting out of which 10,982 or 2.3% cases were selected whereas out of 124,004 or 2.5% sales tax cases, 3,116 cases were selected through balloting whereas out of 725 cases of FED, the FBR selected 56 cases for audit.
Minister of State for Revenue Hammad Azhar launched the audit program by pressing the button for conducting electronic balloting randomly selected for audit for tax year 2018.
On this occasion, the FBR also launched its new website with simplified features and more facilitation for online tax payers.
Addressing the ceremony, Hammad Azhar said unlike the previous exercise, the FBR had selected fewer cases for audit to ensure good quality of the audit as well as as cost cutting on the audit procedures.
“Once the notices are issued to the persons for audit, the tracking system would be utilized with the help of new technology and all the process would be complete within given time,” he remarked.
He said with respect to recovery of data of three to four million non tax filers, a huge exercise was continued with National Database Regulatory Authority and much of the data has already been received.
“We are going to launch an aggressive drive against such non-filers soon to expand our tax net besides enhancing the revenue collection,” he added.
With respect to shortfall in revenue collection, the minister attributed the shortfall of Rs 300 billion to increasing pricing trend of petroleum in the international market, compression of imports, change in income tax slabs by the previous regime, and the legal intervention in telecommunication sector.
Talking to media after his address, Hammad Azhar lashed out at former finance minister Ishaq Dar for spreading rumors regarding Pakistan’s currency saying that he wanted to further devalue the currency on the basis of his speculations.
He categorically rejected the former finance minister’s claim of making any pledge for taking down the Pak rupee to a certain level saying that the incumbent government had not make any such commitment.
He said Ishaq Dar’s claim of bringing the Dollar to Rupee rate down to Rs 120 was only possible by increasing foreign debts and country’s deficit.
“He is an absconder, and convicted in criminal acts, and is responsible to bring the country’s economy on the verge of bankruptcy,” he said adding he should better come to Pakistan and surrender before the law enforcing agencies instead of teaching the economy.
“What he can teach is how to make the economy worst and how to launder his money,” Hammad added.
To a question, Hammad said the government had not make decision of introducing new amnesty scheme, however, he said if the government will have to take such decision, it will do through proper channel and not through any ordinance.
Replying to another query, the minister said the government had managed to receive data of 152,000 offshore accounts from 29 countries with an approximate value of US$ 11 billion adding that FBR was on its toes to chase them and bring them under the tax net.
He said out of the total identified numbers, 50% accounts were already declared with tax authorities while the remaining were undeclared. Due to his flawed economic policies, every citizen of Pakistan is affected now. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-04-19/news_big_images/485467_92066762.jpg,business

He said Dar was spreading false news after causing immense damage to the economy during his four years tenure in the government.

Panama Papers helps recover more than $1.2 billion around the World,"
FRANKFURT AM MAIN (AFP/Web Desk) – Taxmen in 22 countries worldwide have raked in more than $1.2 billion in fines and back taxes thanks to the 2016 ""Panama Papers"" leak of information about offshore dealings, media reported Wednesday.
Since June 2018, the United Kingdom alone has added $119 million to bring its total to more than $252 million; Australia has collected another $43 million to eclipse $92 million, and Belgium has added an extra $6.5 million to its government coffers to surpass $18 million.
French tax authorities have confirmed nearly $136 million has now been recovered – and that figure is expected to rise. They have carried out more than 500 inspections since April 2016.
Canada’s Revenue Agency, which also raided two properties last week in connection to the investigation, has revealed it should recoup more than $11 million in federal taxes and fines from 116 audits. The agency said it planned to audit about 234 more taxpayers linked to the probe. Fewer than 10 criminal investigations are ongoing.
“The audit work will take several years to complete as many taxpayers are using litigation to obstruct CRA audits,” the CRA told ICIJ’s Canadian partner the Toronto Star.
In Iceland, the Directorate of Tax Investigations has finished 24 investigations relating to the Panama Papers and estimates it has recouped $25.5 million. Icelanders took to the streets after the 2016 investigation was released, and the former prime minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned just days after the first stories were published.
And in Panama, authorities have clawed back more than $14 million in the past three years.
Importantly, investigations are continuing in numerous countries including Austria (where regulators are examining whether two major banks followed procedures to prevent money laundering), Germany, France, and Norway.
German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung -- which received the massive leak of documents from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca on which the investigation was based -- reported Berlin has reaped $183 million from related tax probes.
""While recouping the proceeds of hidden assets helps to fund vital government services, there is a growing sentiment that the enduring legacy of the Panama Papers will be its effect on behaviour and public attitudes,"" the ICIJ said.
Tax authorities have scrambled to respond to the massive tax evasion system that the leak revealed was organised through Mossack Fonseca’s Panama City offices.
More than 100 media organisations participated in the investigation, which uncovered accounts in tax havens held by 140 politicians, football stars and billionaires and enjoyed a global media echo.
Taxing mindsets
Experts have anticipated that the enduring legacy of the Panama Papers will be its effect on behaviour and public attitudes while the recovered amount has funded vital government services. 
ICIJ member and founder and editor-in-chief of the L’Evenement newspaper Moussa Aksar considers the Panama Papers as ""a game-changer.""
“Today people in West Africa pay lots of attention when they do something and when they make a transaction. They say to themselves that could there be someone, somewhere working with the ICIJ or another organisation who could investigate this,"" he said.
“They don’t cheat like they used to. They know that sooner or later they will be found out.”
Although many of the methods of evading tax detailed in the Panama Papers were legal, their use has since been widely condemned in the court of public opinion.
University of Leeds Professor of Tax Law Rita de la Feria said the Panama Papers has changed public sentiment towards taxation itself – and a failure to pay a fair share of tax is no longer considered a victimless crime.
De la Feria said: “Before the Panama Papers there was a public tolerance, a kind of ‘good for you’ attitude towards anyone who could avoid paying their fair share of tax.
“The Panama Papers has helped to shift this perception to one of ‘you’re robbing us of public services.’
“The public didn’t fully grasp this reality before but it certainly does now.”

NEPRA approves increase in power tariff by Rs0.80 per unit,"
ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) on Thursday approved an increase in power tariff by Rs0.80 per unit under the fuel adjustment mechanism for the month of February.
According to details, the NEPRA approved the tariff in Islamabad following the recent hike in fuel charges. It is reported that the cost of electricity production has been raised by Rs3 billion due to increase in gas prices.
Besides, in the month of February, 22.7 percent of the power was generated by water resources.

The hike in power tariff will put an additional burden of Rs5 billion on consumers, however lifeline, K-electric and agricultural consumers have been excluded from being charged.
The power tariff hike comes days after the prices of petrol and high speed diesel were increased by Rs6 per litre.
Inflation rose to 9.41 percent year-on-year, up from 8.21 percent in February, Bureau of Statistics data showed on Monday, lifted by sharp rises in food, fuel and transport costs that have squeezed household budgets.
The Asian Development Bank has predicted that Pakistan’s economic growth is likely decelerate to 3.9% as “macroeconomic challenges continue and despite steps to tighten fiscal and monetary policies to rein in high and unsustainable twin deficits.”
“For FY2018, ended 30 June 2018, the estimated GDP growth rate [was] revised downward from earlier 5.8% to 5.2%. Growth therefore slowed from 5.4% a year earlier. The growth decelerated despite revived agriculture. The expansionary fiscal policy markedly widened the budget and current account deficits and drained foreign exchange,” the ADB report observed.
“Until macroeconomic imbalances are alleviated, the outlook is for slower growth, higher inflation, pressure on the currency, and heavy external financing needed to maintain even a minimal cushion of foreign exchange reserves. Recurrent crises in the balance of payments require that firms become more export competitive,” it added.
The ADB report said inflation is expected to rise sharply to average 7.5% in FY2019, driven up by continued heavy government borrowing from the central bank, hikes to domestic gas and electricity tariffs, further increases in regulatory duties on luxury imports, and the lagged impact of currency depreciation by more than 10.7% since July 2018.",,business
"Gold scales new peak of Rs72,200 per tola","
KARACHI (Dunya News) – Gold rate in Pakistan has hit Rs72,000 benchmark for the first time in Pakistan as the current rate of 24K per tola has increased to Rs72,200.
Likewise, the gold rate 24K per 10 grams has increased to Rs61,900 with the jump of Rs857, whereas the rate of 22K gold per 10 grams has increased to Rs56,742 from the previous Rs55,956.
In markets, jewellery sales have been slowed down as ever rising yellow metal rates had squeezed buying power of consumers. However, investors are quite upbeat in buying gold bars.
The prices have changed since yesterday following further depreciation of rupee by 30 paisa. The Pakistani rupee was being traded at 141.40 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market, and at 143.50 against the US dollar in the open market.
In international market, gold gained on Thursday, supported by an easing dollar as investors awaited progress on the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade negotiations after reports showed that both sides were nearing a deal.
Spot gold rose 0.2 percent to $1,291.89 per ounce as of 0332 GMT. U.S. gold futures firmed 0.1 percent at $1,296.90 an ounce.
“One of the key issues would be the China-U.S. trade negotiations. There is a lot of optimism around the idea that we will see a peaceful resolution and some agreement really soon,” said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist, CMC Markets.
“However, if the trade talks drag out we could see further support for gold because of its implications for growth.”
Gold is often seen as a safe investment during times of financial and political uncertainties.
A pause in the equities rally also helped the bullion. Asian shares held near an eight-month peak as investors awaited developments on trade talks.
Negotiations between the United States and China made “good headway” last week in Beijing and the two sides aim to bridge differences during talks this week, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said.
The dollar was trading near one-week low posted in the previous session after data showed U.S. services sector activity hit a more than 19-month low in March and private payrolls grew less than expected.
Market participants are now awaiting the U.S. nonfarm payrolls data, due on Friday, as it would offer insights on the strength of the U.S. economy.
A weak payrolls data could further weigh on the U.S. unit, making dollar denominated metals cheaper for investors holding other currencies.
Holdings in the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust, also fell for a third consecutive session on Wednesday. Holdings were at their lowest level since Dec. 17 at 24.57 million ounces.
Among other precious metals, spot platinum rose the most in more-than-two-years in the previous session to touch its highest level since end-June 2018 at $879.03 an ounce.
The auto-catalyst metal was down 0.2 percent at $872.93 an ounce on Thursday, while its sister metal palladium was up 0.3 percent at $1,409.15.
Silver dipped 0.3 percent to $15.09 per ounce.

ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet on Wednesday approved import of 100,000 tons of urea fertilizer to cater to the demand of farmers.
The committee, which met with Finance Minister Asad Umar in the chair, also decided to allow additional import of urea in the event of any demand-supply gap. 
It directed the Ministry of Industries and Production to review the price mechanism of fertilizer industry for ensuring provision of urea to the farmers at cheaper rates.
The ECC directed the relevant institution to check market manipulation activities in the fertilizer sector and use all the powers available under the law to penalize elements involved in that practice.
Earlier, the officials of the Industries and Production Division briefed the committee about the availability of urea in the country.
They also apprised the committee about the status of National Accountability Bureau cases against seven persons involved in corruption in Pakistan Steel Mills.

ADB predicts Pakistan's economic growth to go down to 3.9pc in 2019,"
(Dunya News) – Following a pronounced widening of the country’s balance of payments deficit in 2018, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has forecast Pakistan’s economic growth to go down to 3.9 percent in fiscal year 2019.
In its report titled “Asian Development Outlook (ADO) 2019,” the bank said Pakistan’s GDP growth is forecast to drop to 3.9% in FY2019 as “macroeconomic challenges continue and despite steps to tighten fiscal and monetary policies to rein in high and unsustainable twin deficits.”
The report said, “Until macroeconomic imbalances are alleviated, the outlook is for slower growth, higher inflation, pressure on the currency, and heavy external financing needed to maintain even a minimal cushion of foreign exchange reserves. Recurrent crises in the balance of payments require that firms become more export competitive.”
The ADB report mentioned inflation is predicted to rise sharply to common 7.5% in FY2019, pushed up by continued heavy authorities borrowing from the central financial institution, hikes to home gasoline and electrical energy tariffs, additional will increase in regulatory duties on luxurious imports, and the lagged affect of forex depreciation by greater than 10.7% since July 2018.
To meet its large financing needs, the government is discussing a macroeconomic stabilization program with the IMF in addition to arranging financial assistance and oil credit facilities from bilateral sources.
Continued fiscal consolidation in fiscal year 2020 will keep growth subdued at 3.6 percent. The supply side is already showing signs of slowdown. Agriculture is expected to under-perform the 3.8 percent growth target for fiscal year 2019 after water shortages struck as wet season crops were being sown.
Imports fell by 0.8 percent in the first 7 months of fiscal year 2019 from the same period of fiscal year 2018, with imports other than oil 5.7 percent lower because of slower domestic economic activity, currency depreciation, and an increase in import duties for nonessential items.
Remittances are expected to revive—having already risen by 10 percent in the first 7 months of fiscal year 2019 over the same period of fiscal year 2018—as the Pakistan rupee depreciate further, economic activity in the Middle-eastern oil exporting countries (major destination of Pakistani migrants) holds broadly steady, and the government takes measures to facilitate remittances through official channels.
The government’s diaspora bonds—issued in January 2019 with terms of 3 and 5 years and an attractive return of over 6 percent—aim to tap resources from overseas Pakistanis.
Inflows that do not incur debt, such as foreign direct investment, are expected to be lower in fiscal year 2019 as several CPEC energy projects are near completion.
Financing a high current account deficit in fiscal year 2019 will require substantial borrowing, as in the first 7 months of the year, and use much of the bilateral lending support announced in the early months of 2019 to finance the deficit in the balance of payments. Foreign exchange reserves, depleted to $8.1 billion in February 2019, will likely remain stressed at the end of fiscal year 2019.
The report further states that Pakistan ranks 107 of 140 economies on the Global Competitiveness Index 2018. It is classified as inhabiting the first stage of development among 35 factor-driven economies— that is, economies heavily reliant on unskilled labor and natural resources.
The high cost of doing business is a key factor limiting firms’ ability to compete. Access to affordable capital is constrained by a shallow and underdeveloped capital market.
Manufacturing firms face high corporate tax rates, taxes on dividends and retained earnings, cascading taxes levied on inter corporate dividends, and a super tax levied on retained reserves.
The effective corporate tax rate of up to 49% is significantly higher than taxes on international competitors. High custom duties on machinery imports raise the cost of investment, and high tariffs on raw materials and intermediate inputs erode the price competitiveness of both exporters and domestic industries facing stiff competition from imports. High tariffs and undependable electric power add to production costs.
Earlier, Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) data showed that  Inflation in Pakistan rose to its highest level for half a decade in March 2019.
The data further showed that data showed that CPI inflation General increased by 9.41% on year-on-year basis in March, 2019 as compared to an increase of 8.2% in the previous month and 3.2% in March 2018.
On month-on-month basis, it increased by 1.4% in March 2019 as compared to an increase of 0.6% in the previous month and an increase of 0.3% in corresponding month i.e. March 2018.

Rupee hits record low at Rs141.40 against US dollar ,"
KARACHI (Dunya News) – Rupee further depreciates by 30 paisa and is being traded at 141.40 against the US dollar in the interbank market, on speculations in the market that Pakistan has entered final stage with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to let the currency depreciate ahead of obtaining a bailout.
Subsequently, Pakistan s external debts increased by Rs110 billion.
Currency dealers said the greenback has started gaining fast against the rupee since the last visit of International Monetary Fund officials to the country in March. They added that the State Bank of Pakistan has directed the open market to trade dollar within the range of Rs142-142.50.
Economists see this rise due to strict monetary policies of government in order to fulfill the requirements of the IMF and due to a fall in Foreign Direct investment (FDI).
Due to the recent hike in the price of dollar, the masses are expected to take burden of high inflation with increase in the prices of household items, besides the recent increase in petroleum prices.
Since its inception, the Imran Khan led federal government has been trying to seek bilateral support to plug the trade gap and ease pressure from our foreign exchange reserves.
The latest round of rupee depreciation comes after the delay in the IMF bailout package that is still being negotiated.
Finance Minister Asad Umar said negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had entered the final stage with settlement of almost all the issues related to the signing of an agreement.
“We are very close to each other and there is no fundamental difference,” the minister said while talking to media-persons after launching the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs) Regulations.
The Minister added that at present the IMF was engaged in summer meetings with the World Bank and soon after the meetings, its mission would visit Pakistan to finalize the bailout package.",,business
Top Afghan cricket players criticise change of captain,"
ISLAMABAD (AFP) - Afghanistan has named a new captain to lead the cricket team into the forthcoming World Cup -- a move that has not gone down well with some of the players.
The Afghanistan Cricket Board announced Gulbadin Naib would skipper the one-day side, Rashid Khan the Twenty20 team and Rahmat Shah the Test squad.
Naib replaces Asghar Afghan, and board chairman Azizullah Fazli said the changes were a ""long time investment and to compete in a better way"".
But less than two months before the start of the World Cup in England and Wales, the move was criticized on social media by some players.
Former captain Mohammad Nabi tweeted the decision was ""ill timed with World Cup just round the corner"", saying the team had ""gelled really well under Asghar"".
""Being a senior member of the side and having seen the rise of Afghanistan Cricket, I don t think it is the right time to change the captain,"" said Nabi, who led Afghanistan in their first World Cup campaign four years ago.
Rashid Khan, the new Twenty20 skipper also sounded off.
""With all the respect to the Selection Committee, I strongly disagree with the decision as it is irresponsible & bias,"" he tweeted.
""As we have @cricketworldcup in front of us, Captain #MAsgharAfghan should remain as our team Captain.""
Afghanistan plays Australia in their opening match of the World Cup in Bristol on June 1.
They are regarded as dark horses having beaten both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in the Asia Cup last year, as well as forcing a tie with eventual champions India.

"Jonny be good as Bairstow, bowlers take Hyderabad to top of IPL","
NEW DELHI (AFP) - A quickfire 48 by England s Jonny Bairstow and disciplined bowling helped Sunrisers Hyderabad climb to the top of the Indian Premier League table after a five-wicket win over Delhi Capitals on Thursday.
Chasing a modest 130 for victory, Hyderabad depended on Bairstow s 28-ball blitz to achieve the target with nine balls to spare in Delhi and register their third straight win in this edition of the Twenty20 tournament.
Earlier skipper Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammad Nabi and Siddarth Kaul took two wickets each to set up the win for Hyderabad after they restricted Delhi to 129-8 in 20 overs.
""Really pleased with the start, just going to try and keep going,"" wicketkeeper-batsman Bairstow said after receiving the man of the match award.
""We have three games in quick succession now and hopefully we keep playing the same brand of cricket. We have a great bunch of guys and we hope to keep going.""
The in-form Bairstow, who hit a match-winning 114 in his team s previous game against Royal Challengers Bangalore, put on 64 with opening partner David Warner.
Bairstow, who was involved in a record 185-run opening stand with Warner in Sunday s win, took the attack to the opposition with nine fours and one six before being trapped lbw off leg-spinner Rahul Tewatia.
""Jonny is obviously in red-hot form coming on the back of a hundred. When you are confident like that, you don t think about the negative result,"" Australian great and Delhi coach Ricky Ponting told reporters after his team s third loss in five matches.
""Running down the wicket, he is not even thinking that he is going to miss the ball, always thinking about that he is going to hit it in the middle for a six.""
Left-handed Australian star Warner, who has also been in top form to boost his return from a ball-tampering scandal, looked out of sorts before falling to paceman Kagiso Rabada for 10 off 18 deliveries.
Delhi struck back with three more wickets but Yusuf Pathan, on nine, and Nabi, with 17, completed the chase as Hyderabad celebrated a third win in four games.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-04-19/news_big_images/485519_24652279.jpg,Cricket

Hazlewood says tight Ashes schedule will force bowling rotation,"
SYDNEY (AFP) - Australian pace spearhead Josh Hazlewood has foreshadowed bowler rotations during this year’s Ashes series, saying the tight schedule will make it ""near impossible"" for the top quicks to play every Test.
The team will face Joe Root’s England in five Tests in less than seven weeks, immediately after the one-day World Cup.
Hazlewood said the workload meant the chances of himself, Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins playing every Test was slim.
""The last four Tests are back-to-back,"" Hazlewood told Cricket Australia’s The Unplayable Podcast Thursday.
""I think it’s going to be near impossible for any quicks to play all five with it being such a tight schedule.""
Hazlewood, who has been sidelined since January with a back injury but is confident of being fit for the World Cup, admitted a long period of short-format cricket leading up the five-day Ashes Tests was not ideal.
But he said it would at least ensure the team was playing at the highest level.
""I think we’ve got one four-day game between those two tournaments (World Cup and Ashes) and a couple of training sessions,"" said Hazlewood.
""It’s going to be a pretty quick turnaround.""
Hazlewood played in the first four Tests during the Ashes in England in 2015 before an injury forced him out of the fifth.

"From retirement thoughts to WC spot, NZ's Neesham on the up and up","
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Less than 18 months ago, New Zealand all-rounder Jimmy Neesham had become so disaffected with cricket he would open the curtains on match day and hope it was raining.
A timely chat with Heath Mills, the head of the New Zealand players’ union, however, ended his thoughts about retirement and ultimately propelled him back into the national side and then on Wednesday into the country’s World Cup squad.
“Opening the shades and hoping it was raining is not the ideal way to begin a day of cricket,” Neesham told reporters on Thursday, the day after he was named in the squad for the May 30-July 14 tournament in England. “I think I needed to just have a full overhaul in the way I was approaching the game.
“I actually called Heath Mills 18 months ago and told him I was going to retire. He convinced me to take a little break.
“Luckily I took his advice ... and obviously since then it’s been on the up and up.”
With his ability to bat in the top order and bowl fast-medium pace, Neesham was once considered to be the answer to New Zealand’s search for an all-rounder when he made the side in late 2012.
The early stages of his career were hampered by injury, however, and in 2017 a decline with the ball saw him dropped from the national side.
The following year he was removed from the central contracts list, with the message from selector Gavin Larsen that he needed to “demand our attention again”.
The power-hitting left-hander tried to respond by pushing himself to score more runs, but only piled more pressure on himself.
“I wanted to dominate and score hundreds every game and once that starts going in a downward spiral and you’re not going well, you put more pressure on yourself,” he said.
“When I was the most driven, I played my worst. Trying too hard doesn’t seem to help as a cricketer.
“Once I got over those feelings and began to enjoy myself again then that’s when things started to get better.”
Part of that process involved leaving Otago, where he had spent seven years, and move to Wellington where coach Bruce Edgar, captain Michael Bracewell and former New Zealand pace bowler Hamish Bennett all helped him regain his confidence.
Since being recalled to the national side in January, the 28-year-old has played eight one-day internationals in his comeback and scored 204 runs at an average of 68, while taking 10 wickets at 22.90, enough to convince selectors he should be on the plane for England.
“It was a long road back, but once I got back to scoring runs and taking wickets I knew I wasn’t too far away if I put a good couple of months together,” he added.
“But to get the call, it’s pretty surreal.” ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-04-19/news_big_images/485368_62850339.jpg,Cricket
Chief selector Inzamam terms KP Talent Hunt Program vital for searching new faces,"
PESHAWAR (APP) – Chief Selection Pakistan Cricket Board Inzamam-ul-Haq and star wicket-keeper batsman Rashid Latif termed KP Talent Hunt Program a vital step taken by Senior Minister Sports KP Muhammad Atif Khan for searching out new faces in cricket and other games.
Talking to media men during a press briefing here at Media Center, Chief Selector Inzamam, also known as Inzi, urged upon the Directorate of Sports KP to extend such program at U-14 level so that to develop the much needed nurseries of various games at grassroots level.
While appreciating the Talent Hunt Program, Inzamam said allocating Rs. 50 Million for the Talent Hunt Program initially is very encouraging steps taken by Senior Minister for Sports, Tourism, Culture and Youth Affairs Muhammad Atif Khan and keen interest shown by DG Sports KP by involving Kabir Khan, Wajahat Ullah Wasti and other international and first class cricketers who visited across KP and merger tribal districts and conducted trials.
Answering a question about Pakistan team performance against Australia, chief selector Inzamam said that the team have given good fight despite we have rested 5 to 10 playing eleven players and hopefully the selected players would give good result in the World Cup.
Rashid Latif said that looking after the upcoming batsmen mean KP have good talent and certainly these batsmen would go through under qualified coaches would learn more as far their developing their skills are concerned.
Widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time, Inzamam is the leading run scorer for Pakistan in One-Day Internationals, and the third-highest run scorer for Pakistan in Test cricket, appreciated Senior Minister KP Muhammad Atif Khan for launching Talent Hunt Program in nine different games including cricket.
Inzamam is the only Pakistani batsman to score 20,000 runs in international cricket. He was the captain of cricket team from 2003–07 and is considered to be one of the best leaders in Pakistan Cricket history. Inzamam rose to fame in the semi-final of the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Inzamam retired from international cricket in 2007, following the second Test match against South Africa, falling three runs short of Javed Miandad as Pakistan’s leading run scorer in Test cricket at the time. Following his retirement, he joined the Indian Cricket League, captaining the Hyderabad Heroes in the inaugural edition of the Twenty20 competition. In the ICL’s second edition, he captained the Lahore Badshahs, a team composed entirely of Pakistani cricketers. In April 2016, he was appointed the chief selector of the Pakistan National Cricket Team.
Inzamam said that a total of 6000 players from 36 districts including district of recently merged tribal areas took part in the trials in their respective districts, out of the 6000 players 250 players were short-listed for the second phase of trials at Maazullah Khan Cricket Academy Peshawar.
Soon after selecting 250 players, he said, medical checkup of the players were conducted at Shaukat Khanum Hospital to ascertain age of every individual. He disclosed that out of 250, 110 players according to the medical report were declared overage and 140 were called for the trials.
Out of 140 players, a total of 82 players were short-listed in the morning session of the trials supervised by Inzamam and final 60 were short-listed to make four teams of 15 players each. These teams, he said, would play seven One-Day and as many Twenty20 matches before final selection of 20 players for a longer duration of training and coaching under qualified coaches.
A contract would also be signed with these final selected 20 players for two years. Answering a question, Inzamam said that out of the final 20 players the chances of the players would be high enough to be selected for the forthcoming Under-19 World Cup and other national teams. Besides cricket, Squash, Football, Volleyball, Hockey, Cricket (male), Badminton (male & female), Table Tennis (male & female), and Athletic (male & female).

Ponting backs Carey as World Cup keeper and potential captain,"
SYDNEY (AFP) - Alex Carey has been endorsed by Ricky Ponting to be Australia s wicket-keeper at the World Cup, with the team s batting coach also backing him as stand-in captain if Aaron Finch is injured.
The 27-year-old has enjoyed a rapid rise through the ranks with his calm demeanour and leadership qualities winning over the former skipper, who will be coach Justin Langer s right-hand man at the tournament in England and Wales this year.
""Alex Carey offers the best package as keeper,"" Ponting, who played at five World Cups, told cricket.com.au when asked who he sees filling the role.
Chief selector Trevor Hohns recently mentioned Test skipper Tim Paine and the in-form Matthew Wade, as well Peter Handscomb, as other possible wicket-keeping options.
But Ponting believes Carey deserves the opportunity after his performances in Australia s recent eight-game winning streak.
""He s dangerous at the top of the order or late in the innings because he does score 360 degrees, he s a deceptively hard hitter of the ball and for mine, he s just the right character, he s the right person that you want to have in your team,"" he said.
""I actually think he s got really good strong leadership qualities as well.
""If anything happened to Finch through the World Cup or leading into the World Cup, then I think he s really well-equipped to lead the side, even though he s still relatively inexperienced and never captained Australia before.""
Carey is already joint vice-captain alongside Pat Cummins, with several other senior players, such as Usman Khawaja, also possibilities to lead the side should Finch be injured.
Defending champions Australia must name their World Cup squad this month.
""I d like to be at the World Cup first,"" Carey said when asked about the captaincy, adding: ""We ve got lots of leaders around this group.""",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-04-19/news_big_images/485339_98471352.jpg,Cricket
"Power-hitting a concern for Pakistan, says Mickey Arthur","
LAHORE (Agencies) - Mickey Arthur, the Pakistan coach, has cited one area of concern for Pakistan at the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2019: the lack of power-hitting.
Pakistan were blanked 5-0 against Australia in the United Arab Emirates, and despite a couple of individual performances, their batting was by and large found wanting. When batting first, they failed to press home the advantage, and when chasing, they struggled to take it down to the wire, even losing by 80 runs in the decisive third one-day international.
There were plenty of centuries – two each from Haris Sohail and Mohammad Rizwan, and one from Abid Ali – but as filled as they were with strokes, there was no muscle and power. Arthur was left longing for that.
“That s one of our areas of concern,"" said Arthur. “We have to make sure that we get our guys to bat in those positions as best as they can. That s the reason we used Faheem Ashraf in two games. He has done hell of a work in that regard and we wanted to give him more batting time. We have worked really hard with Imad Wasim in that role.
“Hasan [Ali] can hit the ball long distances. Shadab [Khan] has worked extremely hard on that aspect of his game. Shoaib Malik and Mohammad Hafeez have worked consistently on their power-hitting. But it is an area that is a worry, and we have to work extremely hard to rectify it.”
The series was a test of Pakistan’s bench strength, and despite the loss, it did throw up some interesting talking points ahead of the World Cup, fitness being the top-most among them.
“I ve already asked our skill coaches to give me what they think is necessary for our players. That might be working on death bowling, on variations or bowling slower balls,” he said. “Power-hitting is the one on which we need to work constantly. I ve asked the skill coaches to give me those plans and we will start implementing in the next couple of days.
""Plus, we need our players to have optimum fitness levels. We saw the difference in the field between our normal players, the guys with whom we ve worked for two years, and the players who have just came to our system. The gap is massive, we can t have that happen ever again.”
Pakistan’s preparations for the World Cup aren’t done yet. They head to England later this month, where they will play a solitary Twenty20 International and five ODIs. Arthur said this would be the “best-prepared squad that’s ever left Pakistan” for the World Cup.

New Zealand name untested Blundell in World Cup squad,"
WELLINGTON (AFP) - New Zealand opted for experience in a 15-man squad named Wednesday for this year s cricket World Cup, with rookie Tom Blundell s inclusion as back-up wicketkeeper the only real surprise.
The Black Caps hope to shed their tag as valiant losers and claim the title after exiting in the semi-finals six times and suffering a heavy defeat to Australia in their only appearance in the final four years ago.
New Zealand are currently third in the one-day rankings, behind England and India.
Coach Gary Stead said the Kane Williamson-led side had repeatedly excelled at the top level and he was confident the consistency would shine through at the tournament in England and Wales.
""We ve got a squad here of 15 players that we think can give us a really, really good chance of going far into the tournament,"" he said.
""If we play close to our potential, then hopefully we can do New Zealand proud.""
Wellington keeper Blundell was selected after Tim Siefert, the regular back-up to first-choice gloveman Tom Latham, broke his finger in a domestic match last month.
While Blundell, who has two Test caps, will likely make his one-day international debut at the tournament, his role will be marginal if Latham stays fit.
Mitchell Santner will be the New Zealanders  primary spinner, with Ish Sodhi edging Todd Astle to claim the second slow bowling position.
""(Selecting) the spinners was very tough, and both had signs at times that they should ve been the one that was selected... but at the end of the day that s my call to make,"" Stead said.
The pace attack comprises Tim Southee, Trent Boult, Lockie Ferguson and Matt Henry, while Jimmy Neesham and Colin de Grandhomme add all-round options.
Henry Nicholls is set to open the batting with veteran Martin Guptill after displacing Colin Munro at the top of the order, although Munro will make the trip as batting cover.
Williamson and Ross Taylor, in his fourth World Cup campaign, complete a battle-hardened batting line up.
Williamson, Taylor and Guptill have collectively amassed 526 ODI appearances between them.
Guptill and Taylor have not confirmed their post-tournament plans but will most likely be looking to exit cricket s biggest stage on a high.
The Black Caps will open their campaign against Sri Lanka in Cardiff on June 1.

(Reuters) - Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) have fined Dimuth Karunaratne $7,000 after the test captain’s arrest on Sunday for a drink driving accident violated the terms of his player contract, the country’s governing body said on Wednesday.
The driver injured in the accident in Colombo was later discharged from hospital and Karunaratne was released on bail. The batsman later produced himself in court and also apologised for his actions as SLC began its own inquiry into the incident.
“Sri Lanka Cricket decided to impose a fine of $7,000 on Dimuth Karunaratne after the player was found to have violated the ‘Player Contractual Obligation’ entered into with SLC,” the board said in a statement.
“However, considering Karunaratne’s earlier track record, where he has maintained a very high professional standard as a player, SLC will not take further action against him.”
Karunaratne captained Sri Lanka when they became the first Asian team to win a test series in South Africa last month.

ICC to join hands with Interpol to tackle corruption,"
(Reuters) - The International Cricket Council (ICC) will work more closely with Interpol as part of ongoing efforts to combat corruption in the sport, the governing body said on Wednesday.
Alex Marshall, ICC’s general manager of its anti-corruption unit, met Interpol officials in Lyon last week to seek closer working relations, it added.
“The ICC has an excellent relationship with law enforcement agencies in a number of countries but working with Interpol means we are connecting with their 194 members,” Marshall said in a statement.
“Our focus is on education of players and prevention and disruption of corruptors. Where our enquiries reveal criminal offences have been committed, we will refer this to the relevant law enforcement organisations and this makes Interpol an important partner for us.”
Cricket has suffered a series of corruption cases in recent years.
In 2011, Pakistan’s Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were found guilty of taking bribes to fix part of a test match against England in a case that prosecutors said revealed rampant corruption at the heart of international cricket.
Earlier this year, the ICC had granted Sri Lankan cricketers a 15-day amnesty to report previously undisclosed information relating to corruption in the sport.

Eoin Morgan’s top-ranked side enter the tournament as the one of the most consistent teams in the format and their quest for a first 50-overs title begins against South Africa at The Oval on May 30.
Since their shock group-stage exit from the 2015 World Cup, England have been particularly strong at home, winning 30 of their 42 ODIs while losing only nine.
“England have an outstanding chance,” Cook, who retired last year from international cricket, told Sky Sports.
“This is first time going into a World Cup England have such a settled squad. Everything looks great from the outside, they have every option covered.”
England failed to cope with raised expectations at the 2017 Champions Trophy when they lost to eventual winners Pakistan in the semi-finals.
Cook is positive such blips can only make a team mentally stronger.
Since the start of last year, England have come out on top in bilateral ODI series against World Cup holders Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and India.
“They had that blip in the (2017) Champions Trophy, where they lost in the semi-final to Pakistan when they were favourites, but you need those lows to be able to grow as a side,” he added.
“They are favourites. This is a great opportunity for Eoin (Morgan) and the guys to play some fantastic cricket.
“There are match winners throughout the squad, there are batsmen that can win games on their own, and over the last six or eight months the bowling has really come on. I think they are going to win it.” ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-03-19/news_big_images/485225_35531340.jpg,Cricket
Punter taps Carey as possible stand-in skipper at World Cup,"
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia assistant coach Ricky Ponting has backed Alex Carey to be the team’s wicketkeeper at the World Cup and believes the former Australian Rules footballer could also step up to lead the defending champions if required.
Carey was named a co-vice captain of the limited-overs sides captained by Aaron Finch during the home summer, and has impressed with his glovework during recent series against Pakistan and India.
Selector Trevor Hohns has named test skipper Tim Paine and the experienced Matthew Wade as wicketkeeping options for the 50-over World Cup starting in May but Ponting feels Carey offers the “best package”.
“He’s dangerous at the top of the order or late in the innings because he does score 360 degrees, he’s a deceptively hard hitter of the ball and for mine, he’s just the right character, he’s the right person that you want to have in your team,” Ponting, an assistant to head coach Justin Langer for the World Cup, told Cricket Australia’s website (cricket.com.au)
“I actually think he’s got really good strong leadership qualities as well.
“If anything happened to Finch through the World Cup or leading into the World Cup, then I think he’s really well-equipped to lead the side, even though he’s still relatively inexperienced and never captained Australia before.”
Carey, who captained Australian Football League expansion side Greater Western Sydney before they joined the top flight in 2012, only made his international debut 14 months ago in a one-day match against England.
But the 27-year-old has played another 18 ODIs since and won acclaim for his calm demeanour behind the stumps and at the crease.
Carey has set his sights no higher than ensuring his spot in the 15-man World Cup squad, expected to be announced next week.
“I’d like to be at the World Cup first,” the South Australian said.
“We’ve got lots of leaders around this group.
“Usman Khawaja is playing some really good cricket and he’s taken his game and his leadership to the next level.
“(Fellow vice-captain) Pat Cummins is another one who has lots of respect around the group. We’ve got lots of guys.
“Hopefully Finchy is fine and stays on the park and we don’t have to worry about that one.” ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-03-19/news_big_images/485184_42784470.jpg,Cricket
New Zealand name experienced World Cup squad,"
WELLINGTON (AFP) - New Zealand opted for experience in a 15-man squad named Wednesday for this year s cricket World Cup, with rookie Tom Blundell s inclusion as back-up wicketkeeper the only real surprise.
The Blacks Caps hope to shed their tag as valiant losers and claim the title after exiting in the semi-finals six times and suffering a heavy defeat to Australia in their only appearance in the final four years ago.
Coach Gary Stead said the Kane Williamson-led Black Caps had repeatedly proved itself at the top level and he was confident the consistency would shine through at the tournament in England and Wales.
""We ve got a squad here of 15 players that we think can give us a really, really good chance of going far into the tournament,"" he said.
""If we play close to our potential, then hopefully we can do New Zealand proud.""
Wellington keeper Blundell was selected after Tim Siefert, the regular back-up to first-choice gloveman Tom Latham, broke his finger in a domestic match last month.
While Blundell, who has two Test caps, will likely make his one-day international debut at the tournament, his role will be marginal if Latham stays fit.
Mitchell Santner will be the New Zealander s primary spinner, with Ish Sodhi edging Todd Astle to claim the second slow bowling position.
The pace attack comprises Tim Southee, Trent Boult, Lockie Ferguson and Matt Henry, while Jimmy Neesham and Colin de Grandhomme add allround options.
Henry Nicholls is set to open the batting with veteran Martin Guptill after displacing Colin Munro at the top of the order, although Munro will make the trip as batting cover.
Williamson and Ross Taylor, in his fourth World Cup campaign, complete a battle-hardened batting line up.
Williamson, Taylor and Guptill have collectively amassed 526 ODI appearances between them.
Guptill and Taylor have not confirmed their post-tournament plans but will most likely be looking to exit cricket s biggest stage on a high.
The Black Caps will open their campaign against Sri Lanka in Cardiff on June 1.

'I just want to prove it to myself' – Jason Roy opens up on Test ambitions,"
LONDON (Agencies) - Could England s ODI opener Jason Roy be the answer to their top-order struggles in Test cricket? His list of achievements in white-ball cricket is long, and growing by the day. He holds the record for England’s highest ODI score – 180 v Australia – and has shared in their highest ODI partnership, an unbeaten 256 with Alex Hales v Sri Lanka in 2016.
He has opened for England in ODIs more often than anyone else since the last Men’s Cricket World Cup, and no one has played more than his 73 ODIs for England without playing at least one Test match.
Following the retirement of Sir Alastair Cook, and with England having struggled even before his departure to find suitable candidates at the top of the order. Since Andrew Strauss retired in 2012, they have tried 13 men in the position. None have lasted more than 20 Tests in the role, or made more than 1,000 runs from the top two.
With the Ashes approaching, Roy s name has floated towards the top of many people’s lists, searching for someone comfortable in the international arena and setting the tone of a contest. His first-class record, averaging 46.45 since the start of 2014, also marks him out as a Test candidate. He’s feeling comfortable with the attention.
“There are people that want me to play, people that don’t want me to play,” Roy said to Sky Sports. “I just want to play to prove it to myself really. To see where I’m at and to see if I can actually do it. You never know what is going to happen but I just want to put the right stepping stones in and make sure that I m selected, that is the first process.”
One man who knows more opening in Test cricket and Jason Roy than most is former England opener and Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart, who has emphatically backed his charge’s Test chances.
“He is someone who wants to play Test cricket,” Stewart told Sky Sports. “He is such a talent that I believe can play all forms of the game. I said two years ago that he is good enough to play Test match cricket. He has to have a good World Cup and if he does that, I reckon his name will be near enough at the top of the list to play in that Ashes series.”
Roy has rarely opened in first-class cricket, but Stewart thinks his experience in ODIs should stand him in good stead.
“Jason is opening in one-day international cricket. Twenty20 and Test cricket are miles apart, but in the first 10 or 15 overs of 50-over cricket you still have to respect that new ball,” he told BT Sport. “I don’t see it as a big issue for him and he’d cope with the stepping stone up to Test cricket.
“The Australia attack is a challenging attack, but Jason’s method is a solid one. He’s a good stroke player and a good hitter of the ball, but he can defend well too, which you have to be able to do.”

Imad Wasim makes huge gains in ODI rankings after Australia series,"
DUBAI (Web Desk) – Pakistan all-rounder Imad Wasim has made huge gains in the MRF Tyres ICC Men’s ODI Player Rankings after scoring 141 runs in the series against Australia and taking three wickets.
The left-hander, who led his side in the last two matches after Shoaib Malik had to withdraw due to an injury, has gained 16 places to reach 68th among batsmen, advanced seven places to reach 37th in the list of bowlers and moved from 16th to joint-sixth among all-rounders along with West Indies captain Jason Holder.

Australia captain Aaron Finch has moved into the top 10 of the ODI rankings after a superb run in the series against Pakistan which his side won 5-0 to bolster its confidence just two months before the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2019.
The 32-year-old’s player of the series effort of 451 runs, with two centuries and at an average of 112.75, has seen him gain 12 slots to reach joint-ninth position, even as his other team-mates too made important gains in the list of batsmen with memorable efforts in the five-match series in the United Arab Emirates.
Finch’s opening partner Usman Khawaja has gained six slots to reach 19th position after scoring 272 runs in the series while Glenn Maxwell has advanced 10 places to reach 23rd place with 258 runs. Shaun Marsh has gained three slots to reach 44th after an aggregate of 182 runs.

Clever kitty: Cats know their names,"
 PARIS (AFP) - Cats are able to distinguish their own names from other similar-sounding words, even when said by strangers, according to new research released Thursday.
While dogs  ability to respond to verbal commands from humans has been known for centuries, much less is understood about how cats react to spoken cues.
Researchers in Japan decided to test how well cats are able to distinguish the meanings of words that sound similar to each other.
They studied 78 cats from households and a cat cafe and found most were able to recognize their own names from other words that had the same length and stress, even when an unfamiliar person was speaking.
""Many cat owners know that cats understand their own names,"" said Atsuko Saito, from Sophia University s Department of Psychology.
""However, there is no scientific evidence about that ability And people who have no experience keeping cats do not know about the cats  high cognitive ability.
""They seem to associate their name to some rewards or punishments This is a natural and general learning ability in animals,"" added Saito, lead author of the study published in the Nature journal Scientific Reports.
In the test scenarios, Saito and her colleagues read each cat a series of like-sounding words followed by the cat s name.
They then measured the cats  responsiveness to each, including ear, head or tail movement as well as movement towards the person speaking.
Both household and cafe cats showed a similar ability in differentiating their names from general words
However the cafe cats were less able to distinguish their own names from those of other cats This might be because they frequently heard their own name alongside others, and had learned to associate all those names with reward or punishment.
""There are so many studies about dog ability to communicate with humans,"" said Saito, who has a male cat, Okara.
""We think it is important to show cats  ability This will help to make both cat and human welfare better"".",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-04-19/news_big_images/485483_73250171.jpg,entertainment

Film icons bring star power to India's monumental election,"
COIMBATORE (AFP) - On a humid evening in India’s south, drummers and dancers heave to Kamal Haasan’s blockbuster hits, whipping a huge crowd into ecstasy just as the moustachioed megastar himself steps onto the stage.
There is a red carpet, confetti and coloured lights rippling over the sea of jiving fans screaming Haasan’s name, but this is no concert -- it’s an Indian political rally worthy of a superstar.
The path from celebrity to politics is well-trodden in India and Haasan -- an icon of Tamil Nadu cinema, or ""Kollywood"" -- is one of many stars on the hustings ahead of the national election starting next week.
Thousands of candidates are contesting the election -- the biggest in history, with 900 million eligible voters -- but not all have the X-factor of Haasan and other stars on the campaign trail.
The 64-year-old launched a political party in 2018 to much fanfare and excitement in Tamil Nadu, where he is a household name after decades as a leading man on the silver screen.
His rallies more closely resemble movie sets from his career than the boilerplate campaign functions hosted by India’s political hopefuls.
In Coimbatore city, musicians and dancers in riotous colour performed energetic dance numbers from Haasan’s films as fans packed the rally ground for a glimpse of the star.
In the crowd, fans cradled framed images of the film icon brought from home, and wore scarves imprinted with his face, as they sang and danced along to his classics.
The man himself is not even contesting the election, but is fielding 40 candidates to vie for seats for his party in the national parliament, far away in New Delhi.
But there is no mistaking who is the force behind the party, his face beaming down from rallies, posters and giant screens.
""All the candidates are my faces, and I will be the chariot puller,"" he thundered at a recent rally in Coimbatore, assuring the crowd where their votes were going.

‘He sounds more believable’ 


Parties of all persuasion seek celebrity endorsement come election time, particularly exploiting the country’s devotion to film and cricket.
With millions of voters and a dizzying array of candidates and parties, allying with a hugely-recognisable face works wonders, said Rasheed Kidwai, who has written a book about Bollywood’s role in politics.
""A prominent face that is already recognised by the masses obviously helps because of the massive size of our parliamentary constituencies,"" he told AFP.
""Their onscreen image also helps in creating a better connection with the masses.""
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is fielding Hema Malini and Kirron Kher in this election, both Bollywood veterans and leading lights of the Indian film industry.
Smriti Irani, a massive television star, was appointed a cabinet minister in Modi’s government after the BJP stormed to power in the last election.
Gautam Gambhir, who was part of India’s 2011 World Cup winning side, joined the BJP in March, following in the footsteps of countless cricketers turning star power into political capital after retiring.
Modi’s chief opponents in Congress also court big names, with film star Urmila Matondkar recently throwing her weight behind Rahul Gandhi’s party and fellow actors Raj Babbar and Shatrughan Sinha already on board.
Vaasanthi, an author on celebrities and politics, said many actors found the reality of campaigning and governing more taxing than anticipated.
""The parties want to use their glamour but it is not like standing in front of the camera and acting,"" the Delhi-based writer, who goes by one name, told AFP.
Some of Haasan’s opponents have suggested he lacks political acumen, a jibe that rings a bit hollow in Tamil Nadu, a state governed by one celebrity leader or another for the better part of 50 years.
""The opposition is asking, ‘Who is this guy? He is just an actor’. Yes, I am an actor, everyone knows that. An honest actor,"" Haasan told a crowd to cheers recently.
Among his diehard supporters, Haasan can do little wrong.
""I have been a fan for years,"" said Abhirami, a housewife sitting with her young daughter in the front row of the Coimbatore rally.
""There is a lack of good leadership in Tamil Nadu. Now that he has joined politics, I am here to support him. He sounds more believable and honest that most politicians."" ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-04-19/news_big_images/485417_98748769.jpg,entertainment

Britney Spears takes some 'me time' after dad's second surgery,"
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Pop star Britney Spears said on Wednesday she was taking a little “me time” after a report she checked herself into a mental health facility to help cope with her father’s illness.

Spears, 37, announced in January that she was pulling out of all her concerts and work commitments to be with her family after her father Jamie came close to death in November after suffering a ruptured colon.

On Wednesday, the “Stronger” singer posted a message on her Instagram account saying, “We all need to take time for a little ‘me time’.” She also posted a quote reading “Fall in love with taking care of yourself, mind, body, spirit.”

Celebrity website TMZ said Spears voluntarily checked herself into a residential mental health facility about a week ago.

A source close to the singer said Jamie Spears was not doing well after a second surgery three weeks ago, and that Britney was finding his prolonged illness hard to deal with.

“They are very close. She just wants to take time to focus on herself,” the source told Reuters.

Jamie Spears is credited with reviving the career of his teen sensation daughter after her life spiraled out of control in 2007-08. He remains the court-approved conservator of her business affairs.

Spears became a pop phenomenon in 1999 with her debut single “...Baby One More Time” and subsequent hits like “Oops!...I Did It Again.” She made a comeback in late 2008 with the album and world tour “Circus” and has performed in Las Vegas since 2014.

Spears in January withdrew from a new series of concerts in Las Vegas that were due to run from February-August. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-04-19/news_big_images/485378_77190137.jpg,entertainment
Revealed: The beginnings of Gotham arch-villain the Joker,"
LAS VEGAS (AFP) - Warner Bros. gave fans their first glimpse Wednesday of the hotly-anticipated origin story for DC Comics’ criminal crown prince the Joker -- with Joaquin Phoenix as the diabolical figure behind the creepy face paint.
The trailer for ""Joker"" dropped a day after the upcoming movie was previewed at the CinemaCon industry convention in Las Vegas, where Warner wowed delegates -- mainly movie theater operators -- with an upcoming slate that includes ""It: Chapter Two,"" led by Jessica Chastain.
Phoenix’s ""Joker"" is at least the sixth live-action interpretation of a character made famous by Cesar Romero and Jack Nicholson -- and taken up a level by Heath Ledger, who won a posthumous Oscar for the role in 2009.
Director Todd Phillips explores the roots of Gotham’s villain, a man beaten down by the world, in what entertainment blog JoBlo called ""a really dark and twisted character study.""
""Joaquin Phoenix is living in the role and this will no doubt be another inspired and manic performance from him. If you’re missing the ‘dark’ DC, then here’s your medicine,"" it tweeted.
The trailer shows Phoenix as Arthur Fleck before he became an evil-doer: dancing with his mother, working as a street clown and being a victim himself, harassed and assaulted on a subway train.
""My mother always tells me to smile and put on a happy face,"" he muses. ""She told me I had a purpose to bring laughter and joy to the world.""
After a group of youths steal the store sign he is holding and smash it in his clown face, he asks: ""Is it me or things are getting crazier?""
Only the trademark maniacal cackle presages the darkness that lies ahead.
""I don’t have a lot to say about the film as it’s still taking shape,"" said Phillips, a New Yorker known for frat house comedies including the ""Hangover"" trilogy and ""Road Trip.""
He told the annual gathering of producers, distributors and theater operators that much of the  ""chatter"" about the movie had been inaccurate.
""But I suppose that’s to be expected when you set out to make an origin story about a beloved character that basically has no definitive origin,"" he said.
""Joker,"" described by Phillips as a ""tragedy,"" opens in October in the United States.
From the DC universe, Warner previewed the sequel to ""Wonder Woman"" and ""Birds of Prey,"" for 2020, in addition to ""Shazam!"" which opens on Friday.
The Amazonian warrior Diana ""is now at her full powers,"" ""Wonder Woman 1984"" director Patty Jenkins said in a video.

Mafia women 


Other highlights of the Warner Bros. presentation included announcements and footage from ""Shaft,"" ""Space Jam"" with LeBron James, ""Godzilla"" and ""Detective Pikachu,"" who appeared on stage as a hologram voiced by Ryan Reynolds.
The horror segment left more than one delegate with goosebumps as the audience was shown a scene in ""It: Chapter 2"" where Beverly Marsh returns to her father’s house and is surprised that an old woman lives there.
The sequel follows Beverly’s ""Losers’ Club"" decades later, with adult versions of the youngsters in the 2017 film played by Bill Hader, James McAvoy and Isaiah Mustafa, as well as Chastain.
The studio also plans to premiere ""The Goldfinch,"" based on the acclaimed book about a child in mourning for his mother; an adaptation of the detective novel ""Motherless Brooklyn,"" Edward Norton’s sophomore release as director; and the drama ""The Good Liar"" with Helen Mirren.
August will see the release of ""The Kitchen"" with Elisabeth Moss, Melissa McCarthy and Tiffany Haddish, about the wives of imprisoned mobsters who end up learning the business of their husbands -- and become very dangerous.
""Everyone knows very strong women in challenging positions but you don’t often get to see that in film,"" McCarthy said, adding that what she loves about the movie is that it shows ""so many layers to women.""
For Haddish, ""people only think that ‘Oh, she’s just a mother, she’s just this, she’s just that,’ but now we can make you laugh... We can kill you,"" she joked.
Haddish grew up in southeast Los Angeles and said she had tried to join gangs.
""But they wouldn’t let me. I was too goofy.""

Streaming helps boost 2018 music industry sales,"
LONDON (AFP) - Worldwide music sales rose by nearly 10 percent in 2018, a fourth consecutive year of growth fuelled by online streaming, according to figures released on Tuesday by an industry body.
Revenues reached $19.1 billion last year, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which represents the recorded music industry worldwide, said in its Global Music Report 2019.
""We are now much more optimistic,"" said IFPI chief executive Frances Moore, describing the period prior to recent growth as a ""mourn-fest"" when ""we only had bad years"".
However, the overall growth of 9.7 percent in sales masks a discrepancy within the industry, with streaming buoyant -- accounting for almost half of revenues -- while downloads and physical purchases continued to drop.
The streaming sector, which includes subscription fees and advertising income, grew by 34 percent to reach $8.9 billion in 2018.
There were 255 million users of paid streaming services at the end of year, according to the report.
But paid downloads fell by 21.2 percent and physical sales of music were down by 10.1 percent.
Despite the growing presence of paid streaming services, piracy remains a problem with an estimated 120 million online users illegally ripping music from streams each month, Moore said.
""They are hacking and downloading the music... at the price of the stream, and very often they are not paying at all,"" he said.
""And whole discographies can be downloaded with bittorrent and other forms,"" Moore added.
Marked regional disparities exist within the positive global growth picture.
For a second year running, Latin America saw the largest increase, with total sales up 16.8 percent.
In North America, where the transition from physical to digital music formats is well advanced, sales also jumped, by 14 percent last year.
However, in Europe sales rose a miniscule 0.1 percent.
Meanwhile, the IFPI’s annual singles chart saw rising Cuban-American star Camila Cabello, Canadian rapper Drake and Briton Ed Sheeran top of the pile.
In the album rankings, the soundtrack of smash hit musical movie ""The Greatest Showman"", South Korean boyband BTS and US star Lady Gaga were the biggest sellers.
Vinyl, an increasingly popular format for audiophiles and nostalgic listeners, also saw sales grow for the 13th consecutive year.
It now represents 3.6 percent of the industry’s total turnover.    ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-03-19/news_big_images/485204_58040333.jpg,entertainment
Pop singer Nazia Hassan's 54th birth anniversary being celebrated today,"
(Dunya News) – Regarded as the original pop diva of the sub continent, late Nazia Hassan is being remembered on her 54th birthday by her fans in Pakistan and abroad.
Pop queen Nazia Hassan was born on April 3rd 1965 and debuted into the massive music industry of the subcontinent by introducing the disco genre with her Aap Jaisa Koi song for Feroz Khan’s film Qurbani.
Aap Jaisa Koi was a massive hit that led to the trio Nazia Hassan, her brother Zoheb Hassan and London-based music director Biddu collaborating for their very first album Disco Deewane which was another massive hit and had topped the charts home, India and abroad.
The iconic Disco Deewane that became youth’s anthem at the time was so ahead of its time that it was borrowed in Karan Johar’s 2012 film Student Of The Year.
Nazia and Zoheb went on to release four more albums namely Star, Young Tarang, Hotline and Camera Camera.
The pop icon decided to quit singing in order to pursue philanthropy, a reason why her final album was dedicated to the battle against narcotics cause.
Nazia went on to earn her LLB degree from University of Lancaster and took a job as Political Analyst at the United Nations headquarters in New York where she concentrated her research on disputed areas especially the Palestinian territories and Kashmir.

God of War bags another ‘game of the year’ award at BAFTA ,"
(Web Desk) – God of War, the action-adventure genre game, bags another best game of the year award at 15th annual BAFTA Games Awards.
God of War is rooted in ancient Norse mythology with Kratos, the former Greek god of war, along with his demi-god son Atreus.
Despite receiving six nominations, UK-made western adventure Red Dead Redemption 2 walked away empty-handed at the glitzy ceremony in central London.
The first God of War game was released in 2005. This eighth instalment in the series, developed by Santa Monica Studio, sees its iconic lead character Kratos - son of Zeus - as a struggling single parent.
Cory Barlog, director of God of War, told the BBC winning the awards was ""amazing, overwhelming, and scary"".
He said the win showed that story-led games could be as ""relevant"" as the presently popular Battle Royale style titles.
Nintendo’s Labo won two awards, one for best family game and the other for innovation.
It is the cardboard toolkit that lets players explore the interactivity of the firm’s Switch console, for example by creating a piano.
The BAFTA winners in full were:
•	Original Property: Into the Breach
•	Music: God of War
•	Game Design: The Return of the Obra Dinn
•	Evolving Game: Fortnite
•	Narrative: God of War

•	Best Game: God of War
According to BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat’s gaming reporter Steffan Powell, he said it was surprising that Red Dead Redemption 2 had not won in any category.
""A game of such depth and innovation (whether you finished it or not!) - their loss is the independent sector’s gain. Tonight shows titles from smaller teams that manage to speak a certain truth to players can be just as successful (in awards terms - not cash!) as the big guns,"" he tweeted.

"Elon Musk safe for now as U.S. judge urges Tesla CEO, SEC to end tweet dispute","
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Elon Musk’s job as Tesla Inc’s chief executive appeared safe on Thursday as a federal judge in Manhattan urged the billionaire to settle contempt allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over his use of Twitter.
At a hearing in Manhattan federal court, U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan gave both sides two weeks to work out their differences, and said she could rule on whether Musk violated his recent fraud settlement with the regulator if they failed.
“Take a deep breath, put your reasonableness pants on, and work this out,” the judge said.
The hearing appeared to lift an overhang over Tesla, as the SEC stopped well short of recommending Musk’s removal as chief executive or even from the electric car company’s board.
Instead, the regulator suggested that greater oversight of Musk’s communications, including the threat of new fines if he backslides, was punishment enough, at least for now.
“What this is to the SEC is strike two, and if there is another transgression they might seek a director and officer bar,” said Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit and a former SEC lawyer. “They are just trying to send a message: be more careful.”
Nathan had been asked to hold Musk in contempt over a Feb. 19 tweet, where the SEC said he improperly posted material information about Tesla’s vehicle production outlook without first seeking approval from its lawyers.
The SEC said pre-approval was a core element of the October 2018 settlement, which resolved a lawsuit over a tweet last Aug. 7 where Musk said he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 per share.
That settlement called for Musk to step down as Tesla’s chairman, and levied $20 million (£15 million) civil fines each on Musk and the Palo Alto, California-based company.
Musk declined to discuss the hearing as he left the courthouse, surrounded by a horde of reporters, photographers and television cameras, but said “I feel very loved here.”
In a statement provided later by Tesla, Musk said: “I have great respect for Judge Nathan, and I’m pleased with her decision today. The tweet in question was true, immaterial to shareholders, and in no way a violation of my agreement.”

TESLA ALSO FAULTED

Tesla’s share price tumbled 8.2% on Thursday, after the company on Wednesday night reported lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries, but recouped some early losses once Musk’s job no longer appeared imperilled.
The company built its reputation on luxury cars, but has faced several production challenges with its Model 3 sedan, which it hopes will reach a mass audience.
“Elon Musk was very well composed in the court today, which means he’s taking it seriously,” Craig Irwin, a Roth Capital Partners analyst who attended the hearing, said in an interview. He called Nathan’s order “a good outcome for Tesla investors.” Irwin rates Tesla “neutral.”
The battle concerned a tweet that Musk sent to his more than 24 million Twitter followers: “Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,” meaning 500,000 vehicles.
Four hours later, Musk corrected himself, saying annualised production would be “probably around” 500,000 by year end, with full-year deliveries totalling about 400,000.
The SEC said the earlier tweet conflicted with Tesla’s Jan. 30 outlook, when it targeted annualised Model 3 production exceeding 500,000 as soon as the fourth quarter, and projected 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries this year.
Musk’s lawyers countered that the earlier tweet contained nothing new, and that the SEC had conceded during settlement talks that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about Tesla.

RESPECT FOR JUSTICE SYSTEM

At the hearing, SEC lawyer Cheryl Crumpton said a contempt finding could require Musk to file regular reports about how Tesla lawyers are overseeing his tweets.
Noting that Musk had called his $20 million fine “worth it,” Crumpton said the threat of higher potential fines might also be needed to show that further violations would be “not worth it.”
Musk is worth $20.7 billion, according to Forbes magazine.
Crumpton also faulted what she called Tesla’s “troubling” conduct. “Tesla still appears to be unwilling to exercise any meaningful control over the conduct of its CEO,” she said.
Tesla was not accused of contempt.
Musk’s lawyer, John Hueston, countered that the “ambiguity” of the settlement made “the hard penalty of contempt” unfair.
The “funding secured” tweet had sent Tesla’s share price up as much as 13.3 percent. Musk’s privatisation plan was at best in an early stage, however, and financing was not in place.
SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has said he does not favour draconian penalties that could harm investors, saying when Musk settled that “the skills and support of certain individuals may be important to the future success of a company.”
Musk remains an outspoken critic of the SEC.
Since the case began, he has dubbed the regulator the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission,” recalling his attacks on investors who sell Tesla stock short.
And in the early morning of Feb. 26, after the SEC filed its contempt motion, Musk tweeted: “Something is broken with SEC oversight.”
As he prepared to enter the courthouse, Musk told reporters: “I have a great respect for the justice system.”
Asked whether he also respected the SEC, Musk laughed, before turning to go inside. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-05-19/news_big_images/485555_59026352.jpg,Technology
Samsung Electronics sees lowest quarterly profit in more than two years,"
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Friday it was heading for its lowest quarterly profit in more than two years as a glut in memory chips, slowing panel sales and rising competition in smartphones hit margins.
The South Korean tech giant said first-quarter operating profit likely slid 60 percent from a year earlier, missing market expectations and putting it on track for its weakest quarterly profit since late 2016.
Shares in Samsung rose briefly before paring gains to trade flat following the guidance, as many investors are already looking ahead to an earnings recovery on the back an improvement in chip prices in the second half of the year.
Samsung supplies memory chips and screens for its own smartphones and Apple Inc, and server chips for cloud companies such as Amazon. Its semiconductor business is the main profit driver.
“In the second half, memory chip prices will have a soft landing, so falls will slow, and the release of new iPhones later seems like a good sign for Samsung’s display and memory chips,” said Kim Yang-jae, an analyst at KTB Investment and Securities.
The world’s biggest maker of smartphones and memory chips said in a filing January-March profit was likely 6.2 trillion won ($5.5 billion), missing the 6.8 trillion won estimate from analysts according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate.
Revenue likely fell 14 percent from a year earlier to 52 trillion won. The firm will disclose detailed earnings in late April.
Samsung shares were flat as of 0120 GMT, while the broader market up 0.2 percent.
The firm earlier had warned the quarter could be disappointing due to falls in memory prices, and slowing demand for display panels used in Apple’s iPhones.
Samsung’s premium Galaxy smartphones meanwhile are struggling to be profitable due to rising costs of innovation, competition from Chinese rivals and the reluctance of consumers to upgrade, analysts have said.

HIT BOTTOM

Samsung’s share price has leapt more than 25 percent since sinking to a two-year low in early January as some investors bet on a recovery in chip demand.
SK Hynix Inc, Micron Technology Inc and Samsung - which dominate the global market for dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chips used in personal computers, smartphones and servers - recently have issued upbeat assessments of the prospects for a recovery in chip prices.
Hopes were buoyed further when data showed the manufacturing sector in China, the world’s biggest smartphone market, unexpectedly returned to growth for the first time in four months in March.
Samsung is betting a new line-up of smartphones including a foldable handset and a 5G-enabled model will help boost its market share in China, which crashed with the advent of cheaper Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.

Google disbands artificial intelligence ethics board,"
SAN FRANCISCO (AFP) - Google on Thursday confirmed that it has disbanded a recently assembled artificial intelligence ethics advisory panel in the face of controversy over its membership.
The end of the Advanced Technology External Advisory Council (ATEAC) came just days after a group of Google employees launched a public campaign against having the president of conservative think-tank Heritage Foundation among its members.
Another member of the board had already resigned, and the inclusion of a drone company executive had rekindled concerns about potential military uses of artificial intelligence, according to Vox news website, which first reported on the council being disbanded.
""It’s become clear that in the current environment, ATEAC can’t function as we wanted,"" Google told AFP.
""So we’re ending the council and going back to the drawing board.""
Google added that it would seek alternative ways to gather outside input regarding responsible use of artificial intelligence.
 

Keeping AI unbiased 


 
A petition published online called on Google to cull the Heritage Foundation’s Kay Coles James from the council formed a week ago, due to her history of being ""vocally anti-trans, anti-LGBTQ and anti-immigrant.""
""In selecting James, Google is making clear that its version of ‘ethics’ values proximity to power over the wellbeing of trans people, other LGBTQ people and immigrants,"" read a statement posted on Medium by a group identifying itself as Googlers Against Transphobia.
Positions expressed by James contradict Google’s stated values and, if infused into artificial intelligence, could build discrimination into super-smart machines, according to the post.
The group said that reasoning for James being added to the panel has been given as an effort to have a diversity of thought.
As of late Thursday, the online petition showed more than 2,300 signatures from academics, Google employees and others, including technology industry peers.
The controversy comes as the world grapples with balancing potential benefits of artificial intelligence with risks it could be used against people or even, if given a mind of its own, turn on its creators.
Google chief Sundar Pichai said in an interview published late last year that tech companies building AI should factor in ethics early in the process to make certain artificial intelligence with ""agency of its own"" doesn’t hurt people.
The California-based internet giant is a leader in the development of AI, competing in the smart software race with firms such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, IBM and Microsoft.
Last year, Google published a set of internal AI principles, the first being that AI should be socially beneficial.
Google vowed not to design or deploy AI for use in weapons, surveillance outside of international norms or in technology aimed at violating human rights.
The company noted that it would continue to work with the military or governments in areas such as cybersecurity, training, recruitment, health care and search-and-rescue.
AI is already used to recognize people in photos, filter unwanted content from online platforms and enable cars to drive themselves. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-05-19/news_big_images/485536_75900678.jpg,Technology
Huawei strengthens its European presence with cybersecurity center,"
BELGIUM (Reuters) - Chinese telecom giant, Huawei, has strengthened its presence in Europe by developing European standards on 5G security through its newly European-established cybersecurity center.
Huawei opened a cybersecurity transparency center in Brussels on March 5, which allows its customers to test Huawei s source code, software and product solutions. It is the third of its kind in Europe, and the others are in Germany and the UK.
""The main purpose of this center is to host our cyber security solutions to explain our facilities and solutions to customers and stakeholders, and also to perform white and black box verifications (software testing patterns) of the source code of our customers,"" said Anastasios Bikos, an engineer at the center.
Huawei has also welcomed the objective approach of the European Commission during their recommendation for a series of measures to guarantee 5G security at the end of March.
Although the United States has asked for Europe to ban Huawei s 5G technology, the commission didn t make any mention of the company or any other companies as potential risk in its recommendation.
""Huawei understands the concerns of the European Commission. Huawei is ready to work constructively both with European Commission and with all the authorities of all EU member states to jointly elaborate a cybersecurity standard for Europe,"" said Jakub Hera Adamowicz, the EU media and communication manager at Huawei s Brussels office.
Cyber security is one of the major concerns of European countries in the implementation of 5G technology. According to the recommendations of the commission, each member state of the commission should assess the risks of 5G network by the end of June.
Huawei is also willing to collaborate to develop a common strategy for 5G technology in Europe.
""Huawei wants to be one of the key players to shape the digital transformation of Europe. 5G brings huge opportunities. This is not just about a new network generation, this is about transforming the workplace,"" said Adamowicz.
The presence of Huawei in Brussels is of fundamental strategic importance for the relationship between the company and its European counterparts. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-04-19/news_big_images/485495_80985167.jpg,Technology
No plans to delay livestreams despite NZ massacre: Facebook's Zuckerberg,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - Facebook is working to prevent livestreams of terror attacks such as the one in New Zealand but it does not plan to introduce a delay on live feeds, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said.
Zuckerberg, in an interview with ABC’s ""Good Morning America"" broadcast on Thursday, also said he had confidence in measures put in place by Facebook to prevent interference in next year’s US presidential election.
Zuckerberg said a delay on livestreaming ""might"" have limited views of the Christchurch attacks, which were streamed on Facebook Live by the self-avowed white supremacist who carried them out.
The attacks left 50 people dead and sparked criticism of Facebook in some quarters for providing the online tool which allowed the assailant to livestream the carnage in two New Zealand mosques.
Zuckerberg said putting a delay on live streams would ""fundamentally break what livestreaming is for people.""
""Most people are livestreaming, you know, a birthday party or hanging out with friends when they can’t be together,"" he said.
""One of the things that are magical about livestreaming is that it’s bi-directional, right?"" Zuckerberg said.
""So you’re not just broadcasting,"" he said. ""You’re communicating. And people are commenting back. So if you had a delay that would break that.""
Facebook has previously pledged to tighten livestreaming rules including barring its use by people who have engaged in hate speech or violated the network’s community standards.
The social network is also investing in software to quickly identify edited versions of violent video or images to prevent them from being shared or re-posted.
Zuckerberg expressed confidence in measures Facebook has put in place to prevent interference in US elections such as that which occurred in 2016.
""I’m confident in where we are now,"" he said. ""We’ve learned a lot since 2016, where obviously we were behind where we needed to be on defenses for nation states trying to interfere.""
""After 2016, when we saw what Russia tried to do in interfering in the election, we’ve implemented a lot of different measures,"" he said.
""There have been a number of major elections since 2016 where the results have been relatively clean on this front,"" he said.
Zuckerberg said measures put in place include verifying advertisers running political ads and creating an archive of all the political ads on the platform.
The Facebook CEO said bad actors would still try to interfere in elections despite the company’s best efforts.
""What I can guarantee is that they’re definitely going to try,"" he said. ""Our job is to make the defenses stronger and stronger and to build the right partnerships with other folks in the industry and in the intelligence community and help keep this safe.""

Space X’s starship takes off on test trip,"
(Web Desk) – Space X tested their new spacecraft ‘Starship Hopper’ prototype today at the Texas launch site which lasted less than a minute.
According to space.com, Starhopper is a suborbital prototype designed to test the concepts and technologies SpaceX will need to build its new 100-person spacecraft, called Starship, and its massive booster, the Super Heavy.
The prototype s name appears to be a mashup of Starship and Grasshopper, the latter being SpaceX s earlier hopping prototype that led to the company s reusable workhorse Falcon 9 rocket boosters.
New Raptor methane-liquid oxygen engines are rumored to be installed in this new starship of Space X.
Elon Musk tweeted, ""All systems green"" after the test, which may not have gone far but recalls the early days of Grasshopper rocket tests before we got used to the sight of Falcon 9 rocket engines returning to Earth after successful launches.

Force tech giants to share data rather than break them up: academics,"
BUCHAREST (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators should consider forcing tech giants such as Google and Amazon to share their data with rivals rather than break them up, three academics enlisted by the European Commission said on Thursday.
The academics, who were appointed by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager a year ago to look at digital challenges, also called for speedier investigations to deal with the rapid changes in technology markets.
The advice comes against the backdrop of growing unease worldwide about the power of the likes of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple to analyze and process data to expand their dominance.
Breaking up corporate giants has become a hot topic after U.S. democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren raised the issue.
“In the digital age, having the right data may be one of the keys to compete,” Vestager told a conference organized by the Romanian competition agency.
The academics said that making it easier for companies to move data to competing platforms could be a solution to rein in tech giants.
“Requiring dominant players to ensure data interoperability may be an attractive and efficient alternative to calling for the break-up of firms – a way that allows us to continue to benefit from the efficiencies of integration,” they said in their report.
Vestager said she would review the non-binding recommendations before deciding on the next step.
On the issue of companies buying smaller rivals to shut them down, known as killer acquisitions, the academics suggested that enforcers should strengthen and overhaul their arguments why some companies acquiring another in a different but closely related market could harm competition.
They dismissed calls by some for tech giants, such as Google, to be characterized as an essential utility required to provide reasonable use of its service.
“We do not envision a new type of ‘public utility’ regulation to emerge for the digital economy. The risks associated with such a regime - rigidity, lack of flexibility, and risk of capture - are too high,” they said.
The academics are Humboldt University law professor Heike Schweitzer, Toulouse School of Economics professor Jacques Cremer and Imperial College London’s assistant professor of data science Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-04-19/news_big_images/485472_53029520.jpg,Technology
Pilot-less air taxi takes off in Vienna demonstration flight,"
VIENNA (Reuters) - As carmakers push ahead with self-driving vehicles, an Austrian aerospace company and its Chinese partner showed off their pilot-less “flying taxi” for the first time in Europe on Thursday.
The drone’s 16 propellers hummed loudly as it rose above the pitch at Vienna’s Generali Arena, home to soccer club Austria Wien. The slim plane, which weighs 340 kg (750 pounds), circled in the air briefly and came down within a few minutes.
The EHang 216, which can seat two passengers, has been tested comprehensively and is essentially ready for mass production, said Derrick Xiong, co-founder of Chinese drone maker EHang.
Joining the race for new autonomous aircraft services that do not require runways, EHang entered a strategic partnership with Austria’s FACC, owned by Chinese aerospace group AVIC, last year, aiming to offer short-haul services for passengers, industrial equipment and urgent medical deliveries.
The drone can fly at up to 150 km per hour (90 mph) for almost half an hour, FACC Chief Executive Officer Robert Machtlinger said. “It can travel between 50 and 70 kilometers depending on the payload.”
The passenger cabin is small, with leg room that taller passengers might find less-than adequate, an Austrian photographer who took part in a demonstration flight told Reuters.
FACC says it has already received several thousand orders for the 300,000 euro ($336,000) drone, with the highest demand in China.
Competitors working toward offering autonomous flying cars early in the next decade range from aerospace giant Airbus to Uber, and AeroMobil.
“Technically... urban mobility, flying without a pilot is possible, it’s not a dream, it’s existing,” said Machtlinger.
“What is hindering us to go into larger volumes is regulation,” he added. A future legal framework for autonomous flying vehicles should regulate communication with other planes and helicopters and provide traffic rules, he said.
Austria supports international efforts to quickly establish the necessary regulation, said transport minister Norbert Hofer.
“I hope that Austria will be the place where thousands of these drones, of these air taxis will be built and I hope that very soon we will see a lot of these air taxis in the air,” Hofer said. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-04-19/news_big_images/485469_99375756.jpg,Technology
MIT cuts Huawei collaboration over US investigations,"
BEIJING (AFP) - The prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology is cutting future research collaborations with Chinese tech giants Huawei and ZTE, citing US investigations into the companies  alleged sanctions violations.
Federal authorities unveiled sweeping charges against Huawei in January for allegedly stealing technology and violating US sanctions on Iran.
The company has also been under fire in recent months as it faces a global US campaign to blacklist Huawei over espionage fears.
""MIT is not accepting new engagements or renewing existing ones with Huawei and ZTE or their respective subsidiaries due to federal investigations regarding violations of sanction restrictions,"" vice president for research Maria Zuber and associate provost Richard Lester said in a letter.
""The Institute will revisit collaborations with these entities as circumstances dictate,"" they added in the letter posted on MIT s website on Wednesday.
Projects funded by people or groups from China, Russia and Saudi Arabia, those involving work in these countries, and collaborations with people or entities from the countries, would also be subject to ""elevated-risk"" reviews, they added.
The move comes as part of a broader effort to strengthen the process for reviewing international engagements, the letter added.
Other American universities including UC Berkeley and Stanford University have made similar moves to cut research ties with Huawei following the US indictments.
Earlier this year Oxford said it would not pursue new funding from Huawei for either research contracts or philanthropic donations though existing projects would continue.
ZTE came close to collapse last year after American companies were banned from selling it vital components over its continued dealings with Iran and North Korea.
Huawei did not immediately return a request for comment.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang referred questions on the MIT case to the companies involved but said Beijing has always encouraged Chinese firms to abide by local and international rules.
""At the same time, we also urge the government of the country to provide a fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese enterprises,"" Geng said at a regular press briefing.

Facebook: How to reactivate deactivated account,"
(Web Desk) – Facebook has reserved an option of ‘deactivating’ account for its users who might seek to recover their account, instead of deleting it for good.
For some users, there are plenty of reasons to take a break from Facebook.
Instead of heading straight for the ""delete account"" page, consider a more temporary alternative. Merely deactivating your Facebook is far less of a commitment than impulsively deleting your account, and losing all your photos, friends, and other virtual memories permanently.
When you deactivate your account, your timeline, pictures, and personal information will be hidden from the public, tucked away safely in Facebook’s archive until you feel like returning (if you feel like returning, that is).
Some information – such as private messages and things you’ve posted on other people’s walls – will remain visible. In fact, people with deactivated accounts can still chat on Messenger, according to Facebook.
However, your account will not appear in searches and friends will not be able to view your profile while it’s inactive.
When you’re ready to return, reactivating your account is about as simple as deactivating it. Your profile will be entirely restored upon logging back into Facebook or using your account information to log into another site.
How to deactivate and reactivate your Facebook account
1. Find and click on the upside-down triangle in the top right corner of any Facebook page.
2. Select ""Settings"" from the drop-down menu.

3. On the ""General"" page, click on ""Manage Account.""
4. You’ll see a few options under this selection but go ahead and skip to the bottom where it says ""Deactivate your account.""

5. Once you click ""Deactivate your account,"" Facebook will ask that you enter your password. Once entered, Facebook will prompt you to give a reason for leaving before you confirm the temporary deactivation. Remember, you can come back whenever you choose.

6. If you want to restore your account, simply log back into Facebook or use your Facebook account to log into a third-party app. Facebook will send you a verification code to confirm that it’s really you, so be sure that the email address or mobile number listed on your account is up to date.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-04-19/news_big_images/485367_14846318.jpg,Technology
Fiendishly maths problem gets new solution after puzzling world for centuries,"
(Web Desk) – A mathematician in the UK has found the penultimate solution to a fiendish number problem that’s puzzled the world for centuries, if not even longer.
Researcher Andrew Booker, who studies pure mathematics at the University of Bristol, discovered a new solution to a famous Diophantine equation involving the sums of three cubes.
The problem, which has almost certainly been puzzled over for centuries by mathematicians, may date back even further, to the time of the Hellenistic mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria.
Diophantus lived during the 3rd century CE, and is credited as a kind of ‘father of algebra’ for his early work on algebraic and polynomial equations – although related forms of number theory date back much longer back than that, to the ancient Babylonian mathematics of millennia ago.
But enough history, what is the problem? Well, it looks like this: x3 + y3 + z3 = k

Okay, so what we’ve got there is three different numbers, each being cubed, and when you add them all up, they equal a different number, which we’ll call k.
There are lots of different solutions for this problem, depending on what k is, but they’re not always easy to calculate. Far from it.
That’s because while some (often small) values for k are easy to solve, other, sometimes bigger numerals often aren’t.
This excellent video from Numberphile featuring mathematician Tim Browning, now at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, is a fun introduction to the numerous dilemmas posed:
Because the problem can get so difficult, mathematicians started to use computers to solve the puzzle back in the 1950s, due to their ability to crunch numbers in a way that humans simply can’t match.
But the problem is so fiendish, even computers have a hard time of it.
How hard? Well, a few years ago, a French mathematician solved the equation for k = 74, but it took a bank of computers the equivalent of slightly above 105 hours in CPU time.
Not exactly Sudoku on a Sunday afternoon.
The k = 74 breakthrough helped narrow the field down, but up until last month, when Booker released the proof of his new solution, there remained two numbers under 100 that k had never been solved for.
One of those numbers was 33. Basically, adding the cubes of x, y, and ztogether and getting 33 as your answer is very, very hard, it turns out, but Booker found a way to solve the problem.
This is what the first known solution for k = 33 looks like:
33 = 8,866,128,975,287,5283 +(−8,778,405,442,862,239)3 +(−2,736,111,468,807,040)3
If you want to figure out how Booker did it, take a look at his paper here, but you can also watch another Numberphile video, in which he discusses the process.
Funnily enough, it was the popularity of the original Numberphile video on the topic with Tim Browning (embedded at the top of this story) that drew both Booker and French mathematician Sander G. Huisman (who solved k = 74) to the problem in the first place.
It’s a sweet example of how science communication gives back.
But none of us can rest our laurels: k = 42 has never been solved, and it’s the last outstanding number under 100.

"New Australia law threatens social media firms with fines, jail over violent content","
CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia will fine social media companies up to 10 percent of their annual global turnover and imprison executives for up to three years if violent content is not removed “expeditiously” under a new law passed by the country’s parliament on Thursday.
The new law is in response to a lone gunman attack on two mosques in Christchurch on March 15, killing 50 people as they attended Friday prayers.
The gunman broadcasted his attack live on Facebook and it was widely shared for over an hour before being removed, a timeframe Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison described as unacceptable.
Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a suspected white supremacist, has been charged with one murder following the attack and was remanded without a plea. He is due back in court on April 5, when police said he was likely to face more charges.
It is now an offence in Australia for companies, such as Facebook Inc and Alphabet’s Google, which owns YouTube, not to remove any videos or photographs that show murder, torture or rape without delay.
Companies must also inform Australian police within a “reasonable” timeframe.
“It is important that we make a very clear statement to social media companies that we expect their behavior to change,” Mitch Fifield, Australia’s minister for communications and the arts, told reporters in Canberra.
Juries will decide whether companies have complied with the timetable.
A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment on the legislation specifically, but said the company has already taken action to limit violent content on its platforms.
A spokeswoman for Facebook was not immediately able for comment.
Facebook said last week it was exploring restrictions on who can access their live video-streaming service, depending on factors such as previous violations of the site’s community standards.
Australia’s opposition Labor party backed the legislation, but said it will consult with the technology industry over possible amendments if it wins power at an election due in May.
Australia’s parliament will rise until after the election. The newly elected lawmakers will not sit until at least July.
Critics of the legislation said the government moved too quickly, without proper consultation and consideration.
“Laws formulated as a knee-jerk reaction to a tragic event do not necessarily equate to good legislation and can have myriad unintended consequences,” said Arthur Moses, head of the Australian Law Council.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-04-19/news_big_images/485348_32668929.JPG,Technology
Facebook removes exposed user records stored on Amazon's servers,"
(Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Wednesday that it removed public databases containing its user data on Amazon.com Inc’s cloud servers after cybersecurity firm UpGuard discovered millions of exposed records.
UpGuard’s Cyber Risk team announced in a blog post here on Wednesday that Mexico City-based news website Cultura Colectiva had used Amazon servers to openly store 540 million records on Facebook users, including identification numbers, comments, reactions and account names.
Another database, from an app called At the Pool, listed names, passwords and email addresses of 22,000 people, UpGuard said.
Cultura Colectiva said in a statement that all of its Facebook records came from user interactions with its three pages on Facebook and is the same information publicly accessible to anyone browsing those pages.
“Neither sensitive nor private data, like emails or passwords, were amongst those because we do not have access to that kind of data, so we did not put our users’ privacy and security at risk,” Cultura Colectiva said. “We are aware of the potential uses of data in current times, so we have reinforced our security measures to protect the data and privacy of our Facebook fanpages’ users.”
Alex Capecelatro, who was chief executive of At the Pool before it shut down around 2014, did not respond to requests to comment.
Facebook said in its statement that it worked with Amazon to take down the databases once alerted to the issue.
“Facebook’s policies prohibit storing Facebook information in a public database,” the company said.
Facebook has been hit by a number of privacy-related issues, including a glitch that exposed passwords of millions of users stored in readable format within its internal systems to its employees.
Last year, the company came under fire following revelations that Cambridge Analytica obtained personal data of millions of people’s Facebook profiles without their consent.
Facebook later announced changes aimed at protecting user data, including an audit of at least thousands of apps that have the right to access Facebook user data.
Amazon did not respond to requests for comment. It has increased efforts to educate customers about the risks associated with storing user data publicly after several such data privacy lapses by its customers made headlines in recent years.

Japan Display to supply OLED screens for Apple Watch,"
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Display Inc will begin to supply organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens for the Apple Watch later this year, two sources said, a breakthrough for the cash-strapped company whose late shift to OLED has cost it orders from Apple.
The supply deal would mark Japan Display’s foray into the OLED display market, the two sources familiar with the matter said, declining to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media.
A spokesman for Japan Display said he could not comment on specific customers.
Japan Display’s mainstay liquid crystal display (LCD) business has been slumping due to Apple Inc’s recent shift away from LCD, and disappointing sales of the iPhone XR, the only LCD model in Apple’s 2018 line-up.
The OLED display market is dominated by Samsung Electronics unit Samsung Display and LG Display, with Chinese players quickly catching up. OLED displays are generally thinner and allow more flexibility than LCD screens.
Samsung Display is currently the exclusive supplier of OLED panels for iPhones, while LG Display provides a majority of panels for the Apple Watch.

Forever young: study uncovers protein that keeps skin youthful,"
TOKYO (AFP) - Beauty might only be skin deep, but for those wondering how to keep that skin young, scientists may have found an answer in the form of a protein that encourages cell competition.
The prosaically named COL17A1 might not sound like a fountain of youth, but the new study suggests it does the heavy lifting when it comes to keeping skin intact and unimpaired.
The protein works by encouraging cell competition, a key process to maintain tissue fitness. That effectively ""drives out"" weaker cells while encouraging replication of stronger ones.
But ageing results in a depletion of COL17A1, as do familiar enemies of youthful skin, like UV radiation.
And when that happens, weaker cells replicate, leaving the skin thinner, more prone to damage and slower to heal.
The research published Thursday in the journal Nature is based on investigations using mice tails, which share many of the same characteristics as human skin.
After confirming the importance of COL17A1, the team decided to investigate whether they could stimulate the protein once it was depleted effectively looking for compounds that could kick start the anti-ageing process in skin.
They isolated two chemical compounds -- Y27632 and apocynin -- and tested both on skin cells, with positive results.
""Application of these drugs to full-thickness skin wounds significantly promoted wound repair,"" the study said.
The two compounds point to ways of ""facilitating skin regeneration and reducing skin ageing,"" the study added.
In a review of the study commissioned by Nature, two professors from the University of Colorado said cell competition had previously only been studied extensively in fruit flies.
The research ""provides evidence that healthy cells in mammals can also efficiently repopulate adult’s tissues, replacing unfit or damaged cells,"" wrote professors Ganna Bilousova and James DeGregori.
And they said the research offered ""proof-of-principle"" that the two chemical compounds could combat ageing.

South Korea's 'overworked' millennials choose YouTube over Samsung,"
SEONGNAM - Yoon Chang-hyun s parents told him to get his sanity checked when he quit his secure job as a researcher at Samsung Electronics in 2015 to start his own YouTube channel.
Yoon now runs a YouTube channel about pursuing dream jobs and is supporting himself from his savings. One of Yoon s popular YouTube videos, ""Why did I quit Samsung Electronics?"" has got at least 137,000 views since it was posted in December.
The 65 million won ($57,619) a year salary - triple South Korea’s average entry level wage - plus top-notch healthcare and other benefits offered by the world s biggest smartphone and memory chip maker was the envy of many college graduates.
But burnt out and disillusioned by repeated night shifts, narrowing opportunities for promotion and skyrocketing property prices that have pushed home ownership out of reach, the then 32-year old Yoon gave it all up in favor of an uncertain career as an internet content provider.
Yoon is among a growing wave of South Korean millennials ditching stable white collar jobs, even as unemployment spikes and millions of others still fight to get into the powerful, family-controlled conglomerates known as chaebol.
Some young Koreans are also moving out of city for farming or taking blue collar jobs abroad, shunning their society’s traditional measures of success - well-paid office work, raising a family and buying an apartment.
""My mom’s friends mostly asked if I had gone crazy,"" Yoon said, adding he would quit again if he went back to his old job, recalling how unhappy and stressed he had seen his former boss become.
To be sure, the lure of a prestigious chaebol job remains strong, especially with the country mired in its worst job slump since 2009 and youth joblessness near a record high.
Samsung Electronics is still the most desired workplace for graduates as of 2019, a survey of 1,040 job seekers by Saramin, a job portal, showed in February.
However, many entering the workforce are much less willing to accept the long hours or mandatory drinking sessions synonymous with the country’s hierarchical, cutthroat corporate life, experts say.
Similar issues among younger workers are being seen globally. However, South Korea’s strict hierarchical corporate culture and oversupply of college graduates with homogeneous skills make the problem worse.
The mindset of the younger generations is shifting. This January, ‘quitting jobs’ appeared on the nation’s top 10 new year resolution list on major social media sites. Some left without support or new jobs lined up.
Among elementary school students, being a YouTube creator is now the fifth-ranked dream job, behind being a sports star, school teacher, doctor or a chef, a 2018 government poll showed.
Daedoseogwan is one of the successful examples. After quitting one of South Korea s conglomerates SK communications, the 40-year-old YouTube celebrity now has more than 19 million subscribers at his nerd-leaning game channel and makes more than $15 million a year.
Daedoseogwan’s success story has inspired many. Some workers are even going back to school to learn how to become a YouTuber, learning about video cameras and lighting.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-03-19/news_big_images/485307_98199997.jpg,Technology

This involves inserting a body part image and a computer will formulate a 3D stereo gram, which can be printed out by a 3D printer.
""After the printing completes, we can get a male mold. Then we will make a more detailed female mold from it with plaster. By injecting silica gel on the female mold, we will get the face mask we need, and then we will work on makeup as well as hair transplant,"" said Liu Zheng, member with 3D printing body restoration work room in Guangzhou Mortuary House.
In traditional body restoration work, mortuary beauticians usually use plasticine and plaster to repair and reshape damaged faces of the deceased. The work done by hand takes a lot of time and is difficult to restore the original appearance.
With 3D printing technology, it takes only a week to do a full facial restoration. It takes an even shorter time for a partial repair, usually one to two days.
""People who need the service can contact the relevant department of the mortuary house. The price has not been decided, but it will depends on the difficulty. Take the current situation in Shanghai and Beijing for reference, an ordinary case will cost about 10,000 to 20,000,"" said Li Zhijian, manager of Guangzhou Mortuary House. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-03-19/news_big_images/485291_17065986.jpg,Technology
