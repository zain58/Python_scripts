United Nation adopts resolution as Pakistan warns of threat to global peace from Islamophobia,"UNITED NATIONS: The UN General Assembly on Tuesday unanimously adopted a resolution, co-sponsored by Pakistan, that strongly condemns continuing violence and acts of terrorism targeting individuals, including persons belonging to religious minorities, based on religion or belief. After the passage of the resolution that decried the recent Islamophobic terrorist attack in New Zealand, Pakistani Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi highlighted the rise of extreme nationalistic and populist ideologies in the West and also in PakistanÃ¢ÂÂs neighbourhood. That trend, she said in an obvious swipe at IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs Hindutva ideology, was giving rise to Ã¢ÂÂbigotry, intolerance, anti-Muslim hatred and xenophobia.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂPervasive Islamophobia is a global phenomenon and calls for a global response: collaborative, coherent and committed action against incidents that fuel, funnel and fortify this narrative against Islam and Muslims,Ã¢ÂÂ she told the 193-member assembly. Ã¢ÂÂThe adoption of the resolution today is a strong manifestation of our shared commitment to stand united against racial and religious hatred.Ã¢ÂÂ By the terms of TuesdayÃ¢ÂÂs resolution, titled Ã¢ÂÂCombating terrorism and other acts of violence based on religion or belief,Ã¢ÂÂ the assembly condemned in the strongest terms the heinous, cowardly terrorist attack aimed at Muslim praying in two mosques in Christchurch, and expressed its deepest condolences to the families of the victims and to the government and the people of New Zealand. In further terms, UNGA urged the states to protect and promote freedom of religion and belief and to foster a domestic environment of religious tolerance, peace and respect. Introducing the resolution, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, told the UNGA that the international community must stand up against the spiral of hate. Sending condolences to the families of the Muslims who were martyred in Christchurch in a clearly planned terrorist attack, he said that Islamophobia and racism go hand in hand. Rejecting the actions of reckless politicians who often use distorted historical narratives and toxic conspiracy theories to equate Islam with terrorism, he quoted the poet Rumi who said, Ã¢ÂÂListen with ears of tolerance, see with eyes of compassion, speak the language of love.Ã¢ÂÂ In her speech, Ambassador Lodhi, noting that nine victims of the Christchurch attack hailed from Pakistan, said that profiling and stigmatising people from one country leads to drastic consequences. Ã¢ÂÂOur thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims and survivors of this cowardly terrorist attack.Ã¢ÂÂ While expressing solidarity with the people and government of New Zealand, she saluted Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern for her Ã¢ÂÂexemplary leadershipÃ¢ÂÂ in the face of the tragedy. The Christchurch terrorist, she said, was only the latest manifestation of a growing phenomenon rooted in hate, bigotry, racism, and the extremist ideology of racial and white supremacy. Ã¢ÂÂThe rise of extreme nationalist and populist ideologies in liberal Western democracies and elsewhere, including in our region, are fanning the flames of bigotry, intolerance, anti-Muslim hatred and xenophobia,Ã¢ÂÂ the Pakistani envoy added. The growing prejudice against Islam was Ã¢ÂÂevident in policies aimed at creating walls and barriers against displaced populations, as much as in attempts to denigrate Islamic beliefs and our sacred personalities on the pretext of freedom of expression.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe political falsehood of equating people of different religions with violent extremism, in order to garner political support for the forces of hate lies at the heart of this phenomenon,Ã¢ÂÂ Ambassador Lodhi said. Freedom of expression, she said, was often used as an excuse to enable such vile expression to prosper and for hate speech to enter the mainstream. The Christchurch tragedy also exposed social mediaÃ¢ÂÂs radicalising role, she pointed out. Ã¢ÂÂIt is time that we evolve ways to ensure that social media companies are held accountable for their content that incites violence or spreads hatred,Ã¢ÂÂ the envoy said, adding that Islamophobia posed a grave threat to global peace and security. Ã¢ÂÂWe must strengthen efforts to foster a global dialogue on the promotion of a culture of tolerance, dialogue and peace at all levels,Ã¢ÂÂ she said, while emphasising respect for human rights and diversity as well as space for diverse voices, religions, worldviews and faith traditions. Pakistan, she said, was committed to continuing its efforts to build bridges of understanding and challenge and resist those who seek to construct walls of bigotry and hatred. Ã¢ÂÂWe look towards all those who believe in humanityÃ¢ÂÂs common future, to help in evolving a consensus for action to combat the forces of Islamophobia, xenophobia and racism.Ã¢ÂÂ ",https://www.newsone.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/United-Nations.jpg,Pakistan,"['No Pakistani F16 was hit by Indian airforce.Â Pakistan Air Force (PAF) strike with JF17 within the Pakistani airspace across the Line of Control, added the ISPR.']",positive

Accused Christchurch gunman to face 50 murder charges: NZ police,"The man accused of carrying out the Christchurch mosque attacks last month will face 50 murder charges when he appears in court this week, New Zealand police said Thursday. Australian Brenton Tarrant was previously charged with one murder as a holding measure, but police said all the deaths and injuries in the March 15 attacks would be reflected in upgraded charges during his next appearance on Friday. Ã¢ÂÂThe man arrested in relation to the Christchurch terror attacks will face 50 murder and 39 attempted murder charges when he appears in the High Court in Christchurch on Friday,Ã¢ÂÂ they said in a statement. Police said further charges were being considered against Tarrant Ã¢ÂÂ a self-avowed white supremacist Ã¢ÂÂ but did not specify what they were. They could relate to whether the court deems attack a terrorist act. The 28-year-old will appear via video link in the Christchurch court from a maximum-security prison in Auckland. A note from the court this week said the appearance was likely to be brief and would Ã¢ÂÂascertain the defendantÃÂ´s position regarding legal representationÃ¢ÂÂ and other procedural matters. Tarrant sacked a court-appointed lawyer after his first court appearance on March 16, raising fears he wanted to represent himself and attempt to use any trial as a propaganda platform. The court said Tarrant would not be required to enter a plea during FridayÃ¢ÂÂs hearing. The court has now barred media from filming or photographing the accused.

Slain Saudi journalist Jamal KhashoggiÃ¢ÂÂs children paid by kingdom to show restraint : report,"The children of murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi have received multi million dollar homes and are being paid thousands of dollars per month by the kingdomÃ¢ÂÂs authorities, The Washington Post reported Monday. Khashoggi Ã¢ÂÂ a contributor to the Post and a critic of the Saudi government Ã¢ÂÂ was killed and dismembered in October at the kingdomÃ¢ÂÂs consulate in Istanbul by a team of 15 agents sent from Riyadh. His body has not been recovered. The payments to his four children Ã¢ÂÂ two sons and two daughters Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂare part of an effort by Saudi Arabia to reach a long-term arrangement with Khashoggi family members, aimed in part at ensuring that they continue to show restraint in their public statements,Ã¢ÂÂ the Post said. The houses given to the Khashoggi children are located in the port city of Jeddah and are worth up to $4m, the newspaper reported. Salah, the eldest of the children, plans to continue living in the kingdom, while the others, who live in the United States, are expected to sell the homes, the paper said. In addition to the properties, the children are receiving $10,000 or more per month and may also receive larger payments that could amount to tens of millions of dollars each, according to the report. Saudi ArabiaÃ¢ÂÂs powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has been accused of orchestrating KhashoggiÃ¢ÂÂs killing, but the kingdom has claimed that the prince was not involved. Saudi Arabia initially said it had no knowledge of KhashoggiÃ¢ÂÂs fate but later blamed rogue agents for his death. Its public prosecutor has charged 11 people over his murder.

Defensive Partner: US approves $2.6 billion sale of MH-60R helicopters to India,"WASHINGTON: The United States said Tuesday it had approved the sale of 24 MH-60R helicopters to India, significantly boosting its emerging allyÃ¢ÂÂs firepower to target submarines as China expands in the Indian Ocean. In a quick reply to an Indian request submitted late last year, the State Department said it was informing the US Congress as legally required that it was giving the green light for India to buy the 24 helicopters worth a total of $2.6 billion. Nicknamed the Romeo, the MH-60R helicopters manufactured by Lockheed Martin are designed for hunting submarines as well as knocking out ships and conducting search-and-rescue operations at sea. Ã¢ÂÂThis proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to strengthen the US-Indian strategic relationship and to improve the security of a major defensive partner,Ã¢ÂÂ the State Department said in a statement. It called India Ã¢ÂÂa major defensive partner which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia region.Ã¢ÂÂ India, which had estranged relations with the United States since the Cold War, has emerged as one of its leading defense partner with the interests of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs two largest democracies largely overlapping amid their concerns over a rising China and Islamist extremism. India has been alarmed by ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs growing interest in the Indian Ocean as it becomes a global naval power. In a strategy dubbed by Indian and US observers as the Ã¢ÂÂstring of pearls,Ã¢ÂÂ China has made use of a growing number of naval bases in the Indian Ocean, most notably the Gwadar port it is developing in IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs historic rival Pakistan. Indian naval planners have responded with a doctrine to ensure freedom of movement throughout the Indian Ocean, stretching from the Strait of Hormuz to the Strait of Malacca. The Romeos would replenish IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs aging fleet of British-made Sea King helicopters.

"Sharia Law: Brunei introduces stoning to death for gay sex, adultery","Brunei on Wednesday introduced strict new Sharia laws, including death by stoning for adultery and gay sex, despite a storm of global criticism from politicians, celebrities and rights groups. The tough penal code in the tiny country on tropical Borneo island Ã¢ÂÂ ruled by the all-powerful Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Ã¢ÂÂ fully came into force following years of delays. Read:Brunei to impose death by stoning for gay sex and adultery The laws, which also include amputation of hands and feet for thieves, make Brunei the first place in East or Southeast Asia to have a Sharia penal code at the national level, joining several mostly Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia. Rape and robbery are also punishable by death under the code and many of the new laws, such as capital punishment for insulting the Prophet Mohammad (PBUH), apply to non-Muslims as well as Muslims. The United Nations has labelled the laws Ã¢ÂÂcruel and inhumaneÃ¢ÂÂ while celebrities, led by actor George Clooney and pop star Elton John, have called for Brunei-owned hotels to be boycotted. Take a look: Hollywood starts boycotting Brunei SultanÃ¢ÂÂs hotel In a public address to mark a special date in the Muslim calendar, the sultan called for stronger Islamic teachings but did not mention the new penal code. Ã¢ÂÂI want to see Islamic teachings in this country grow stronger,Ã¢ÂÂ he said in the nationally televised speech at a convention centre near the capital Bandar Seri Begawan. The sultan, who has been on the throne for over five decades, also insisted that Brunei was a Ã¢ÂÂfairÃ¢ÂÂ country and the environment for visitors was Ã¢ÂÂsafe and harmoniousÃ¢ÂÂ. Government officials later confirmed the laws had entered into force. The laws have triggered worldwide condemnation. The European Union said in a statement that some of the new punishments Ã¢ÂÂamount to torture, acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatmentÃ¢ÂÂ. Before the new laws, sex between men was already illegal in Brunei and punishable with up to 10 years in jail. But the new code stipulates death by stoning as a punishment for sex between men, while women convicted of having sexual relations with other women face up to 40 strokes of the cane or a maximum 10-year jail term. A 33-year-old gay Bruneian man, who spoke anonymously, said the new laws were Ã¢ÂÂunfair, cruel and should not happenÃ¢ÂÂ. Ã¢ÂÂIt really takes away my happiness and freedom to express myself, and depresses me so much,Ã¢ÂÂ he told AFP. Zulhelmi bin Mohamad, a transgender woman who fled Brunei last year and is seeking asylum in Canada, told AFP that the environment will be more terrifying for the countryÃ¢ÂÂs LGBT community, who were already leading Ã¢ÂÂvery secretiveÃ¢ÂÂ lives. Ã¢ÂÂSome worry a lot and would like to escape the country before they are found out not to be Ã¢ÂÂ¦ heterosexual,Ã¢ÂÂ the 19-year-old said. Global storm of criticism
Confirming the new penal code was now in force, a religious affairs ministry official told AFP: Ã¢ÂÂThe statement from the prime ministerÃ¢ÂÂs office last weekend on (the codes) implementation prevails, hence (April 3) marks the date of its implementation.Ã¢ÂÂ A second government official, speaking anonymously, confirmed it had entered into force. The sultan Ã¢ÂÂ who is one of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs wealthiest men and lives in a vast, golden-domed palace Ã¢ÂÂ announced plans for the code in 2013. The first section was introduced in 2014 and included less stringent penalties, such as fines or jail terms for offences including indecent behaviour or skipping Friday prayers. ClooneyÃ¢ÂÂs call to boycott nine Brunei-owned hotels in Europe and the United States last week catapulted the issue into the international headlines. Since then, a series of well-known figures have lined up to add their names to the chorus of condemnation. The sultan, who is the worldÃ¢ÂÂs second-longest reigning monarch, first called for the penal code in the late 1990s and it appears to enjoy broad support in the former British protectorate of about 400,000 people. Analysts say he is seeking to burnish his Islamic credentials and shore up support among the countryÃ¢ÂÂs conservatives due to the waning fortunes of the oil-dependent economy, which has been ravaged by recession in recent years. It is also unclear whether death by stoning will actually be implemented, as a high burden of proof is needed to hand down the punishment and Brunei has not executed anyone for decades.

Rich and poor united in desperate quest for water in Venezuela,"Crippling power blackouts are subjecting Venezuelans to the second phase of deprivation Ã¢ÂÂ massive water shortages that make no distinction in income or social class, forcing rich and poor alike to wait in long lines for drinking water, while some hoist it from sewers to be able to flush their toilets. On the hill in the Caracas neighbourhood of Petare Ã¢ÂÂ the countryÃ¢ÂÂs largest slum home to more than half a million people Ã¢ÂÂ hundreds of people line up day and night behind two wells. They carry anything that can hold water Ã¢ÂÂ drums, cans, bottles, buckets. When their turn comes, they take as much as they can. A little further on, in the district of El Valle, a crowd formed around a manhole, drawing up water for their toilets. The water is not drinkable, but it will allow them some dignity, to bathe or wash clothes. For the past month, repeated massive blackouts have plunged the country into darkness and disarray. As a result, electric water pumps have shut down, forcing a cut in water supplies. No Water
Ã¢ÂÂWe have no water, no electricity, the power cuts are terrible. Food is going bad,Ã¢ÂÂ says 78-year-old Ernestine Velasco as she recites a litany of deprivation in her modest house, located on an unpaved street in the March 24 district. Ã¢ÂÂWe are having a bad time. There is no transport, thereÃ¢ÂÂs nothing.Ã¢ÂÂ Lack of water is a chronic problem in this teeming corner of Caracas. Though the cost is minimal, the service is non-existent, Velasco says. Ã¢ÂÂThank God, we have this,Ã¢ÂÂ she adds, pointing to the two wells nearby, though Ã¢ÂÂitÃ¢ÂÂs chaos, it makes you want to run away.Ã¢ÂÂ Locals are waiting for the state water company to restore supplies. Even then, they expect it will only be for a few hours. Ã¢ÂÂWe are dry. We donÃ¢ÂÂt have a single drop,Ã¢ÂÂ said Carmen Moncada, tipping over an empty drum. A little further on, in the district of El Valle, a crowd formed around a manhole, drawing up water for their toilets. President Nicolas Maduro has ordered electricity rationing for the next month in a bid to buy his engineers time to fix the problem, which he blames on opposition sabotage designed Ã¢ÂÂto drive the country crazy.Ã¢ÂÂ The working day has officially been shortened to ease the strain on the grid and allow people to get home before dark. Schools that have been shut since March 26 are expected to reopen on Wednesday, however. Prohibitive Price
In a Caracas park where a water tanker is dispensing supplies, a lawyer from the upscale northern neighbourhood of La Castellana arrives to buy the whole tanker-full for his apartment building. The driver of the 1969-era truck, which holds 2,100 gallons (8,000 liters) is quick to name his price: Ã¢ÂÂFor La Castellana, itÃ¢ÂÂs $200.Ã¢ÂÂ Despite the prohibitive price Ã¢ÂÂ VenezuelaÃ¢ÂÂs minimum wage is just over $5 Ã¢ÂÂ the lawyer doesnÃ¢ÂÂt argue. Ã¢ÂÂThis is the price we have to pay to stay in Venezuela,Ã¢ÂÂ said the 42-year-old lawyer, who declined to give his name. A little further on, in the district of El Valle, a crowd formed around a manhole, drawing up water for their toilets. He said he would have to collect the money from his remaining neighbors, a third of whom have joined the exodus of 2.7 million Venezuelans the United Nations say have have left the country since the economic crisis began in 2015. One possible solution for the lawyer and his neighbors was to sink a well to tap the aquifer at nearby El Avila hill, but that would cost $20,000. Right now, the cheaper solution is the tanker. Every day, people fill up from streams running from the hill. William the driver gets his water at a spring in the cityÃ¢ÂÂs Eastern Park Ã¢ÂÂ with government approval Ã¢ÂÂ forming a line with other tanker drivers. In return, they must make three free trips on the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs behalf to distribute water in various parts of the capital. The army enforces the agreement. But in poor areas like March 24, the trucks are slow to arrive, playing on the nerves of locals like Carmen Veliz. She says that in other areas nearby, there has been no water Ã¢ÂÂfor months.Ã¢ÂÂ Such exasperation drove hundreds of people onto the streets Sunday to beat pots and pans in a display of outrage in different parts of the capital. At least three people were injured in clashes with police and pro-government armed Ã¢ÂÂcolectivosÃ¢ÂÂ sent to tamp down the protests. Ã¢ÂÂWhat is the government doing? Neither one thing nor the other,Ã¢ÂÂ says one woman. Referring equally to MaduroÃ¢ÂÂs rival Guaido, she adds: Ã¢ÂÂNo one comes to help usÃ¢ÂÂ¦they are all useless.Ã¢ÂÂ AFP ",https://www.newsone.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/venzuleza.png,World,"['ÂI am delighted to congratulate friend of Pakistan Recep Tayyip Erdogan on another important victory in the Turkish local elections,Â the premier tweeted.']",neutral
Trump says heÃ¢ÂÂs prepared to close Mexico border if necessary,"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was prepared to close the US southern border if necessary but that Mexico has apprehended thousands of people in recent days and its actions have made a big difference in the immigration situation. Trump threatened on Friday to close the border with Mexico this week unless Mexico took steps to help the United States with illegal immigration, a move which had threatened to overload US ports of entry in the region. The administration softened its tone on the issue on Tuesday, saying Mexico was taking greater responsibility for dealing with the immigration flows. Ã¢ÂÂThey have started to do a significant amount more. WeÃ¢ÂÂve seen them take a larger number of individualsÃ¢ÂÂ and hold those who have asylum claims in Mexico while they are being processed in the United States, White House spokeswoman Sanders told reporters at the White House. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂve also seen them stop more people from coming across the border so that they arenÃ¢ÂÂt even entering into the United States. So those two things are certainly helpful and weÃ¢ÂÂd like to see them continue,Ã¢ÂÂ Sanders said. Trump hinted at a softening earlier in a Twitter post on Tuesday. Ã¢ÂÂAfter many years (decades), Mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their Southern Border, mostly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.  He also told reporters at the White House he was still prepared to do that if necessary but that Mexico had apprehended thousands of people in recent days, having a big impact on the border situation.

Nasa head Jim Bridenstine  terms IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs destruction of one of its satellites a Ã¢ÂÂterrible thingÃ¢ÂÂ,"The head of NASA has branded IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs destruction of one of its satellites Ã¢ÂÂ that created 400 pieces of orbital debris and led to new dangers for astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) Ã¢ÂÂ a Ã¢ÂÂterrible thingÃ¢ÂÂ. Jim Bridenstine was addressing employees of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Monday, five days after India shot down a low-orbiting satellite in a missile test to prove it was among the worldÃ¢ÂÂs advanced space powers. Not all of the pieces were big enough to track, Bridenstine explained. Ã¢ÂÂWhat we are tracking right now, objects big enough to track Ã¢ÂÂ weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about 10 centimeters [six inches] or bigger Ã¢ÂÂ about 60 pieces have been tracked.Ã¢ÂÂ The Indian satellite was destroyed at a relatively low altitude of 180 miles [300 kilometers], well below the ISS and most satellites in orbit. But 24 of the pieces Ã¢ÂÂare going above the apogee of the International Space StationÃ¢ÂÂ, said Bridenstine. Ã¢ÂÂThat is a terrible, terrible thing to create an event that sends debris at an apogee that goes above the International Space Station,Ã¢ÂÂ he continued, adding: Ã¢ÂÂThat kind of activity is not compatible with the future of human spaceflight.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs unacceptable and Nasa needs to be very clear about what its impact to us is.Ã¢ÂÂ The US military tracks objects in space to predict the collision risk for the ISS and for satellites. They are currently tracking 23,000 objects larger than 10 centimeters. That includes about 10,000 pieces of space debris, of which nearly 3,000 were created by a single event: a Chinese anti-satellite test in 2007 at 530 miles from the surface. As a result of the Indian test, the risk of collision with the ISS has increased by 44 percent over 10 days, Bridenstine said. The risk, however, will dissipate over time as much of the debris will burn up as it enters the atmosphere. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week announced that the country had destroyed a low-orbiting satellite in a missile test, becoming the fourth country in the world to have carried out the feat. Ã¢ÂÂThis is a proud moment for India,Ã¢ÂÂ the prime minister had said in his first televised national address since late 2016. Ã¢ÂÂIndia has registered its name in the list of space superpowers. Until now, only three countries had achieved this feat,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, just weeks before the country goes to the polls. Pakistan, in a statement through the Foreign Office, had stated it Ã¢ÂÂhas been a strong proponent of the prevention of arms race in outer spaceÃ¢ÂÂ. The statement asserted that space is a Ã¢ÂÂcommon heritage of mankindÃ¢ÂÂ and as such responsibility falls on every nation Ã¢ÂÂto avoid actions which can lead to the militarisation of this arenaÃ¢ÂÂ.

Arab leaders express harmony in rebuking US decision over Golan Heights,"TUNIS: Arab leaders papered over long-running regional rivalries on Sunday to condemn a U.S. move to recognise IsraelÃ¢ÂÂs sovereignty over the Syrian Golan Heights and said stability in the Middle East hinged on creating a Palestinian state. Arab leaders, attending a summit in the Tunisian capital, have been grappling with regional splits over IranÃ¢ÂÂs influence in the Middle East, a bitter Gulf Arab dispute, international pressure over the war in Yemen and unrest in Algeria and Sudan. But they have found a reason to unite against President Donald TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs decision to sign a proclamation last week recognising the Golan Heights as part of Israel, which annexed the area in 1981 after capturing it from Syria in 1967. It follows a U.S. move less than four months ago to recognise Jerusalem as IsraelÃ¢ÂÂs capital, a decision that also prompted Arab condemnation. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state in the West Bank and Gaza. Saudi ArabiaÃ¢ÂÂs King Salman bin Abdulaziz told Arab monarchs, presidents and prime ministers at the start of the summit that his country Ã¢ÂÂabsolutely rejectsÃ¢ÂÂ any measures that affect SyriaÃ¢ÂÂs sovereignty over the Golan Heights. His remarks echoed those of senior Arab officials before SundayÃ¢ÂÂs summit of the Arab League, which usually ends with a final declaration agreed by the 22 member states. Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said Arab leaders also needed to ensure the international community understood the importance of the Palestinian cause to Arab nations. Regional and international stability should come through Ã¢ÂÂa just and comprehensive settlement that includes the rights of the Palestinian people and leads to the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital,Ã¢ÂÂ Essebsi said. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who addressed the meeting in Tunis, said any resolution to the Syrian conflict must guarantee the territorial integrity of Syria Ã¢ÂÂincluding the occupied Golan HeightsÃ¢ÂÂ. RIFTS REMAIN Summit spokesman Mahmoud Al-Khmeiry had said before the summit that Arab states would also repeat a call offering peace with Israel in exchange for occupied Arab lands and would reject any initiative not in line with U.N. resolutions. Khmeiry appeared to be referring to a still-unannounced U.S. peace plan by White House adviser Jared Kushner and Trump son-in-law that Palestinians have refused to discuss.  Despite a show of unity in rejecting U.S. initiatives that support Israeli policies, Arab states remain divided over a range of other issues, including pro-democracy protests that have erupted in the region since 2011 and over IranÃ¢ÂÂs Middle East influence. King Salman, whose country has long vied with Iran for influence, called for confronting what he called the Ã¢ÂÂaggressive policies of the Iranian regimeÃ¢ÂÂ.

Nine Afghan police officials killed by Afghan Taliban in Ghazni,"Nine Afghan policemen were killed when Taliban fighters stormed their checkpoints and launched a follow-up ambush in the eastern Afghanistan city of Ghazni, officials said Saturday. The assault began early Friday when the Taliban attacked two adjacent checkpoints, Ghazni police spokesman Ahmad Khan Seerat told AFP. The Taliban then ambushed a group of police rushing to the scene, killing the head of the local police, Seerat added. In all, nine officers were killed and six were wounded, he said. The toll was confirmed by Arif Noori, spokesman for the Ghazni governor. In August, Taliban fighters briefly held the city of Ghazni before they were pushed out by US air strikes and Afghan forces. FridayÃÂ´s attack highlights the ongoing fragility of AfghanistanÃÂ´s security and the risks faced by local security forces as they man vulnerable checkpoints. President Ashraf Ghani in January said 45,000 security forces have been killed since he took office in September 2014. On its Twitter account, the Taliban claimed to have killed 12 Ã¢ÂÂsoldiers,Ã¢ÂÂ though the group frequently exaggerates numbers.

"New Silk Road critics are Ã¢ÂÂprejudicedÃ¢ÂÂ, ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs top diplomat says","BEIJING: China has never forced debt upon participants of its new Silk Road project as Ã¢ÂÂprejudicedÃ¢ÂÂ critics have suggested, the countryÃ¢ÂÂs top diplomat said on Saturday in a strongly worded defence of a key policy platform of President Xi Jinping. XiÃ¢ÂÂs Belt and Road Initiative, as it is formally called, envisions rebuilding the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond with massive infrastructure spending. But it has proved controversial in many Western capitals, particularly Washington, which views it as merely a means to spread Chinese influence abroad and saddle countries with unsustainable debt through nontransparent projects. The United States has been particularly critical of ItalyÃ¢ÂÂs decision to sign up to the plan this month, during XiÃ¢ÂÂs visit to Rome, the first for a G7 nation. Speaking to the ruling Communist PartyÃ¢ÂÂs official PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs Daily, Yang Jiechi, who runs the partyÃ¢ÂÂs foreign affairs committee, said he had noted that some in the international community believed this was a geopolitical tool and would only bring debt traps for participating countries. Ã¢ÂÂThis obviously shows a lack of objectivity and fair understanding of the Belt and Road initiative. It is a misunderstanding, misjudgement and is even prejudiced,Ã¢ÂÂ wrote Yang, a former foreign minister and ambassador to Washington. China has stressed many times that the Belt and Road is to promote joint development, he added. Ã¢ÂÂThe Belt and Road is open, inclusive and transparent. It does not play little geopolitical games. It does not engage in the exclusion of exclusive small circles.Ã¢ÂÂ Yang noted that many countries, companies and ordinary people participating in the Belt and Road project had Ã¢ÂÂpublicly refuted rumoursÃ¢ÂÂ about it being a debt trap. Belt and Road projects, from their selection to their financing, go through careful risk assessments and the initiativeÃ¢ÂÂs principles stress sustainable development, he said. Ã¢ÂÂFor cooperative partners who have debt difficulties, ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs principle is to appropriately resolve this through friendly consultations, and has never pushed or forced debtÃ¢ÂÂ on anyone, Yang added.

The decision to reject a stripped-down version of MayÃ¢ÂÂs divorce deal has left it totally unclear how, when or even whether Britain will leave the EU, and plunges the three-year Brexit crisis to a deeper level of uncertainty. After a special sitting of parliament, lawmakers voted 344-286 against MayÃ¢ÂÂs 585-page EU Withdrawal Agreement, agreed after two years of tortuous negotiations with the bloc. May had told parliament the vote was the last opportunity to ensure Brexit would take place and cautioned that if the deal failed, then any further delay to Brexit would probably be a long one beyond April 12. Ã¢ÂÂI fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House,Ã¢ÂÂ May told parliament after the defeat. Ã¢ÂÂThis House has rejected Ã¢ÂÂno dealÃ¢ÂÂ. It has rejected Ã¢ÂÂno BrexitÃ¢ÂÂ. On Wednesday it rejected all the variations of the deal on the table.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThis government will continue to press the case for the orderly Brexit that the result of the referendum demands,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. The British pound, which has been buoyed in recent weeks by hopes that the likelihood of an abrupt Ã¢ÂÂno-dealÃ¢ÂÂ Brexit is receding, fell half a percent after May lost, to as low as $1.2977. [GBP/] Within minutes of the vote, European Council President and summit chair Donald Tusk tweeted that EU leaders will meet on April 10 to discuss BritainÃ¢ÂÂs departure from the bloc. The EU executive, the Commission, said that a Ã¢ÂÂno-dealÃ¢ÂÂ exit on April 12 was now Ã¢ÂÂa likely scenarioÃ¢ÂÂ. It was a third failure for May, who had offered on Wednesday to resign if the deal passed, in a bid to win over eurosceptic rebels in her Conservative Party who support a more decisive break with the EU than the divorce her deal offers. It leaves MayÃ¢ÂÂs Brexit strategy in tatters; her strongly pro-Brexit trade minister, Liam Fox, had said Friday represented the last chance to Ã¢ÂÂvote for Brexit as we understood itÃ¢ÂÂ. LAWMAKERS SEEK SOLUTION The deal had twice been rejected by huge margins and, although May was able to win over many Conservative rebels, a hard core of eurosceptics and the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, which props up her minority government, refused to back it. On Monday, lawmakers who have tried to grab control of the process will attempt to agree on an alternative Brexit plan that could command majority cross-party support in parliament, something largely unheard-of in BritainÃ¢ÂÂs political system. The defeat means Britain now has until April 12 to convince the 27 capitals of the EU that it has an alternative path out of the impasse, or see itself cast out of the bloc from that date with no deal on post-Brexit ties with its largest trading ally. Many eurosceptics see this as their preferred option but businesses say it would cause huge damage not only to the worldÃ¢ÂÂs fifth-biggest economy, but also to that of neighbouring Ireland. However, any further extension would not only require Britain to take part in European Parliament elections in May, but also bring months of fresh uncertainty. A second referendum could then be in play, although many lawmakers believe the most likely outcome and only way to solve the crisis will be a snap election. The 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU revealed a United Kingdom divided over many more issues, and has provoked impassioned debate about everything from secession and immigration to capitalism, empire and what it means to be British. Meanwhile the uncertainty around Brexit, the United KingdomÃ¢ÂÂs most significant political and economic move since World War Two, has left allies and investors aghast. Opponents fear Brexit will make Britain poorer and divide the West as it grapples with both the unconventional U.S. presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China. Supporters say that, while the divorce might bring some short-term instability, in the longer term it will allow the United Kingdom to thrive if cut free from what they cast as a doomed attempt to forge European unity.

"PCB now being taken seriously at international level, says Mani","LAHORE: Recent completion of eight HBL PSL season 4 matches in Karachi are an indication that, Ã¢ÂÂPakistan Cricket BoardÃ¢ÂÂs credibility has hit a new level,Ã¢ÂÂ PCB Chief Ehsan Mani said on Monday, adding that the Board is now being, Ã¢ÂÂtaken seriouslyÃ¢ÂÂ on the international rank. PCB Chief was speaking to a press conference in Lahore very next day to the PSL final in which Quetta Gladiators defeated Peshawar Zalmi at the National Stadium Karachi. PCB Chief said that biggest Ã¢ÂÂendorsementÃ¢ÂÂ came from the arrival of 39 to 40 foreign players in Pakistan. Ã¢ÂÂAdd support staff to it and the number reaches 150 people.

A minute of silence was also observed before the start of the match between Islamabad United and Peshawar Zalmi to articulate cohesion with the victims of one of the most dreadful terror attacks in history. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) earlier conveyed distress and sorrow over the Christchurch attacks prior to the Friday prayers. PCB Chief Ehsan Mani said, Ã¢ÂÂOn behalf of the Pakistan cricket fraternity, I would like to condemn in the strongest possible way the cowardly, uncivilized and inhuman terrorist attacks on the innocent worshippers in Christchurch mosques.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂOur hearts go out for all those affected by this tragedy as who will feel and understand their pain and loss better than us,Ã¢ÂÂ PCB Chief said. Ã¢ÂÂIn these difficult times, we also stand firmly with our colleagues in New Zealand Cricket and offer our deepest condolences. We are also aware that the Bangladesh menÃ¢ÂÂs cricket team were also praying at a mosque near the Hagley Park. We thank Allah Almighty that all of them escaped unhurt,Ã¢ÂÂ Mani further said. Ã¢ÂÂAs a mark of respect for the victims and to show support and solidarity with the New Zealand community and the NZC, it has been decided that we will observe a minuteÃ¢ÂÂs silence before the start of tonightÃ¢ÂÂs Pakistan Super League match, while all the players and match officials will wear black armbands,Ã¢ÂÂ said Mani. Forty people were killed and 20 more were seriously injured in armed assaults on two Christchurch mosques Friday.

New Zealand police said they have detained three people and had secured a number of improvised explosive devices. He said the suspected IEDs found attached to the attackersÃÂ´ vehicles had been made safe by the military. Video footage widely circulated on social media, apparently taken by a gunman and posted online live as the attack unfolded, showed him driving to one mosque, entering it and shooting randomly at people inside. Worshippers, possibly dead or wounded, lay huddled on the floor of the mosque, the video showed. Witnesses told media that a man dressed in a military-style, camouflage outfit, and carrying an automatic rifle had started randomly shooting people in the Al Noor mosque. The Bangladesh cricket team was arriving for prayers when the shooting occurred but all members were safe, a team coach told Reuters. Prime Minister Imran Khan blamed the increasing terror attacks on Islamophobia post 9/11. Ã¢ÂÂShocked and strongly condemn the Christchurch, New Zealand, terrorist attack on mosques. This reaffirms what we have always maintained: that terrorism does not have a religion. Prayers go to the victims and their families,Ã¢ÂÂ he tweeted. Ã¢ÂÂI blame these increasing terror attacks on the current Islamophobia post-9/11 where Islam and 1.3 billion Muslims have collectively been blamed for any act of terror by a Muslim.

Federer sweeps past Isner in Miami final for 101st title,"MIAMI: Roger Federer lifted the 101st title of his remarkable career on Sunday in dominating style, beating ATP Miami Open defending champion John Isner 6-1, 6-4. Federer, who has skipped the whole clay court season for the past two years, declared the triumph over the big-serving American in just 63 minutes was an ideal performance from which to launch a French Open bid. Ã¢ÂÂI will have to take baby steps going back onto the clay, I have played so little in the last few years so I donÃÂ´t know what to expect but what this win does is takes even more pressure off me,Ã¢ÂÂ Federer said. Ã¢ÂÂAlready just how IÃÂ´ve been playing and moving here makes me believe just going on vacation now, a bit of a break, and then preparation, you physically I should be fine, but again, weÃÂ´ll see how the body is going to react. Ã¢ÂÂI am excited. ItÃÂ´s a good challenge,Ã¢ÂÂ added Federer of trying to dethrone Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros when the second Grand Slam of the season begins on May 26. Federer has been in brilliant form in South Florida, recovering superbly from losing the final in Indian Wells earlier this month to emphatically beat Isner, who was badly struggling with a foot problem at the end of the title match at Hard Rock Stadium. Federer will not appear at the next Masters event in Monte Carlo but is slated to play in Madrid at the beginning of May. Ã¢ÂÂMadrid will be ÃÂ´letÃÂ´s see what happensÃÂ´ and then obviously I want to be ready for Paris and I hope all that hard work is going to pay off for the grass and hard court season,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Against Isner, Federer seized control immediately as a break in the very first game sapped IsnerÃÂ´s confidence and allowed Federer to aggressively gain control of a match which he never looked like losing, especially after the AmericanÃÂ´s foot problem worsened. Isner was struggling badly and was heard telling the trainer during a medical timeout that he feared he had broken his foot. Ã¢ÂÂSomewhere during the first set I started feeling pain on top of my foot and it didnÃÂ´t go away and it just got worse,Ã¢ÂÂ Isner said. IsnerÃÂ´s spirit was crushed after he dropped the first set in only 23 minutes. Ã¢ÂÂItÃÂ´s a terrible feeling, because youÃÂ´re on an island out there. You have no teammates to hide behind and going up against the greatest player ever, you know, playing in this incredible atmosphere, and my footÃÂ´s killing me. Ã¢ÂÂI have never had a broken foot, but thatÃÂ´s what I would imagine it would feel like. Ã¢ÂÂNot that I would have won the match but I could have made for a more interesting match and one that was a little more fun.Ã¢ÂÂ This was FedererÃÂ´s 154th tour final and his 50th ATP Masters showpiece appearance. HeÃÂ´s in the twilight of his stellar career but has no plans to hang up his racket just yet. Ã¢ÂÂIn terms of goals, itÃÂ´s about trying to win titles and trying to manage life so I stay injury-free,Ã¢ÂÂ the former world number one said. Ã¢ÂÂSome days you just donÃÂ´t feel so well but this is a good phase, a good stretch for me right now. I really feel super healthy. ThatÃÂ´s why I have been able to play every day for the last four weeks. ThatÃÂ´s something that maybe hasnÃÂ´t always been the case for the last few years. Ã¢ÂÂSo you appreciate these moments.Ã¢ÂÂ IsnerÃÂ´s booming serve failed to fire and there was to be no repeat of their last meeting at the Paris Masters 2015 when Federer was defeated in a third round encounter. To give the Swiss eight break chances in the first set spoke volumes about the sudden ineffectiveness of the Isner service game Ã¢ÂÂ he took only 50% of points on his first serve during the opener. With Isner hurting, Federer, who finished with a perfect 100% of points won on his first serve, wasted no time in the second set wrapping up his 28th Masters title. AFP.

On the bowling front, Mohammad AmirÃ¢ÂÂs form has come under heavy scrutiny and he found himself out of the team for the second and third ODI. He will be hoping for a recall in the fourth ODI to solidify his place in the squad ahead of the World Cup in England and Wales. On the other hand, Australia who made it six consecutive ODI wins will be banking on their bowlers to continue with their winning momentum. Australian captain Aaron Finch fell just short in his bid to make a hat-trick of hundreds but his knock of 90 set his sideÃ¢ÂÂsvictory as Australia made 266/6 before Pakistan were bowled out for just 186. Star of the third ODI, Pat Cummins who tore through the Pakistani batting order after being rested for the first two games, will be rested again for the remaining two games. Cummins will reportedly be sent home from AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs ODI tour of the UAE early.

"Bitcoin soars 20 percent, mystery buyer triggers frenzy","LONDON: Bitcoin burst to its highest level in almost five months on Tuesday, sending smaller cryptocurrencies up, with analysts ascribing the move to a major order by an anonymous buyer that triggered a frenzy of computer-driven trading. The original and biggest cryptocurrency soared as much as 20 percent in Asian trading, surpassing $5,000 for the first time since mid-November. By late morning, it had settled at around $4,700, still up 15 percent in its biggest one-day gain since April last year. Bitcoin surged to near $20,000 in late 2017, the peak of a bubble driven by retail investors that pushed cryptocurrencies onto the agenda of mainstream financial firms. But wide interest waned as prices collapsed, and now trading is mostly powered by smaller hedge funds, tech firms and wealthy individuals. Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, chief executive of London-based cryptocurrency firm BCB Group, said the move was likely triggered by an algorithmic order worth about $100 million spread across major exchanges Ã¢ÂÂ U.S.-based Coinbase and Kraken, and Luxembourg-based Bitstamp. Ã¢ÂÂThere has been a single order that has been algorithmically-managed across these three venues, of around 20,000 BTC,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂIf you look at the volumes on each of those three exchanges Ã¢ÂÂ there were in-concert, synchronized, units of volume of around 7,000 BTC in an hourÃ¢ÂÂ. For a graphic on Bitcoin price, see Ã¢ÂÂ tmsnrt.rs/2VadrPe Analysts could not point to any specific news or developments in the cryptocurrency sector that could explain the mystery buyerÃ¢ÂÂs big order. Outsized price moves of the kind rarely seen in traditional markets are common in cryptocurrency markets, where liquidity is thin and prices highly opaque. So orders of large magnitude tend to spark buying by algorithmic traders, said Charlie Hayter, founder of industry website CryptoCompare. As bitcoin surged, there were 6 million trades over an hour, Hayter said Ã¢ÂÂ three to four times the usual amount, with orders concentrated on Asian-based exchanges. Ã¢ÂÂYou trigger other order books to play catch up, and that creates a buying frenzy.Ã¢ÂÂ BitcoinÃ¢ÂÂs surge sent smaller cryptocurrencies, known as Ã¢ÂÂaltcoins,Ã¢ÂÂ trading higher. EthereumÃ¢ÂÂs ether and RippleÃ¢ÂÂs XRP, respectively the second- and third-largest coins, both jumped by more than 10 percent. Price moves of smaller coins tend to be correlated to bitcoin, which still accounts for just over half of the value of the cryptocurrency market. Ã¢ÂÂUsually bitcoin is the leader of the market and altcoins tend to follow, as far as direction and sentiment is concerned,Ã¢ÂÂ said Mati Greenspan, an analyst at eToro in Israel. Ã¢ÂÂToday bitcoin is in the driving seat.Ã¢ÂÂ Cryptocurrency markets have been relatively calm so far this year, with bitcoin trading until today between around $3,300 and $4,200. There have been few catalysts for big price moves of the kind seen last year. In 2018, fears of regulatory clampdowns and declining interest from retail investors saw bitcoin slump by about three-quarters. REUTERS.

Uber might buy rival Careem as early as this week,"Uber Technologies Inc is set to offer over $3 billion to buy Dubai-based rival Careem Networks FZ, two sources familiar with the deal told Reuters. UberÃ¢ÂÂs offer could be unveiled during the early part of this week, a third source added. Uber will pay $1.4 billion in cash and $1.7 billion in convertible notes, which will be convertible into Uber shares at a price equal to $55 per share, Bloomberg had earlier reported, citing a term-sheet. Careem declined comment while Uber did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters to comment. Uber has been preparing for an initial public offering, and its bankers have indicated that it could be valued at as much as $120 billion. The U.S.-based global logistics and transportation company has been seeking new avenues of growth even as it faces severe competition in its core business of ride hailing from rivals like Lyft Inc. The IPOs of Lyft and Uber represent a watershed for Silicon ValleyÃ¢ÂÂs technology unicorns, which for years have snubbed the stock market in favor of raising capital privately, with investors happy to back their frothy valuations.

Google fined $1.7 billion for search ad blocks in third EU sanction,"BRUSSELS: Alphabet unit Google was fined 1.49 billion euros ($1.7 billion) on Wednesday, its third large EU antitrust penalty in two years marking the companyÃ¢ÂÂs decade-long regulatory battle in Europe. The European Union antitrust chief, however, gave a cautious welcome to GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs measures to boost competition and give Android users a choice of browsers and search apps, suggesting the companyÃ¢ÂÂs regulatory woes may be coming to an end. The European Commission, which said the fine amounted to 1.29 percent of GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs turnover in 2018, said that the case focused on the companyÃ¢ÂÂs illegal practises in search advertising brokering from 2006 to 2016. Ã¢ÂÂTodayÃ¢ÂÂs decision is about how Google abused its dominance to stop websites using brokers other than the AdSense platform,Ã¢ÂÂ European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told a news conference. She said its actions meant advertisers and website owners had less choice and likely faced higher prices that would then be passed on to consumers. The case concerned websites, such as of newspaper or travel sites, with a search function that produces search results and search adverts. GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs AdSense for Search provided such search adverts. The misconduct included stopping publishers from placing any search adverts from competitors on their search results pages, forcing them to reserve the most profitable space on these pages for GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs adverts and a requirement to seek written approval from Google before making changes to how rival adverts were displayed. THRIVING MARKETS The AdSense advertising case was triggered by a complaint from Microsoft in 2010. Both companies subsequently dropped complaints against each other in 2016. Google said it was taking action to comply with EU orders in two previous cases, one of which concerned its Android mobile operating system that resulted in a record 4.34 billion euro fine last year while the shopping comparison case led to a 2.42 billion euro fine. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂve always agreed that healthy, thriving markets are in everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs interest. WeÃ¢ÂÂve already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs concerns,Ã¢ÂÂ Kent Walker, senior vice-president of global affairs, said in a statement. Ã¢ÂÂOver the next few months, weÃ¢ÂÂll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe,Ã¢ÂÂ he added. Vestager welcomed the move, saying: Ã¢ÂÂWe see positive developments both in the shopping and Android case.Ã¢ÂÂ. GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs foe, the Initiative for a Competitive Online Marketplace, said regulators should stay vigilant. Ã¢ÂÂCompetitors have withered or died. ItÃ¢ÂÂs time for the EU and governments around the world to step in and address the underlying wrong,Ã¢ÂÂ its chairman Michael Weber said in a statement. REUTERS.

Apple says Spotify wants benefits of a free app without being free,"Apple Inc on Thursday responded to Spotify Technology SAÃ¢ÂÂs complaint with EU antitrust regulators, saying the audio streaming service Ã¢ÂÂwants all the benefits of a free app without being freeÃ¢ÂÂ. Spotify, launched a year after Apple unveiled its first iPhone in 2007, said on Wednesday the company unfairly limits rivals to its own music streaming service. AppleÃ¢ÂÂs control of its App Store deprived consumers of choice and rival providers of audio streaming services to the benefit of Apple Music, which began in 2015, Spotify added. In response, Apple said it had approved and distributed nearly 200 app updates on SpotifyÃ¢ÂÂs behalf, resulting in over 300 million downloaded copies of the Spotify app. Ã¢ÂÂThe only time we have requested adjustments is when Spotify has tried to sidestep the same rules that every other app follows,Ã¢ÂÂ Apple said in a statement. Ã¢ÂÂSpotify is free to build apps for Ã¢ÂÂ and compete on Ã¢ÂÂ our products and platforms, and we hope they do,Ã¢ÂÂ it added. The Swedish company has launched a website, outlining different ways in which Apple uses its power to make its platform an Ã¢ÂÂuneven playing field.Ã¢ÂÂ In its reply, Apple has rebutted most of the points made by Spotify on the website, Ã¢ÂÂTime to Play FairÃ¢ÂÂ. The company had also said AppleÃ¢ÂÂs voice recognition system Siri would not let iPhone users play music from Spotify and that Apple had declined to let Spotify launch an app on its smartwatch. The Cupertino, California-based company responded by saying that when it reached out to Spotify about Siri and AirPlay 2 support on several occasions, the Swedish company had said that they were working on it.

Google faces third EU antitrust fine next week,"BRUSSELS: Alphabet unit Google is likely to be hit with a third EU antitrust fine next week related to its AdSense advertising service, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday, with the sanction expected to be much smaller than previous fines. The European Commission in 2016 opened a third case against the worldÃ¢ÂÂs most popular internet search engine by accusing Google of preventing third parties using its AdSense product from displaying search advertisements from GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs competitors. It said that Google, which at that time had held 80 percent of the European market for search advertising intermediation over the previous ten years, had kept its anti-competitive practices for a decade. In response, Google changed the conditions in its AdSense contracts with large third parties, giving them more leeway to display competing search ads. In response, Google changed the conditions in its AdSense contracts with large third parties, giving them more leeway to display competing search ads.

The Commission on Friday declined to comment on the timing of the AdSense decision. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Financial Times earlier reported on next weekÃ¢ÂÂs European Union antitrust fine. Last year, Vestager slapped a record 4.34 billion euro ($4.91 billion) fine on Google for using its popular Android mobile operating system to block rivals. That following a 2.4 billion euro fine imposed on the company in 2017 for blocking rivals of shopping comparison websites. The AdSense case may not be end of GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs EU antitrust woes. EU antitrust enforcers have asked GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs rivals if it unfairly demotes local search competitors, according to a questionnaire seen by Reuters, a move which could lead to a fourth case.

Uber to pay $20 million to settle long-running legal battle with drivers,"SAN FRANCISCO: Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] has agreed to pay $20 million to settle a lawsuit brought by drivers nearly six years ago, according to court filings, resolving one of its many legal battles with drivers ahead of a hotly anticipated initial public offering this year. Drivers for the ride-hailing company argued in the lawsuit they are employees, not independent contractors, as Uber has classified them, and therefore entitled to benefits and reimbursement for their expenses. The settlement amount is one-fifth of the $100 million settlement offer Uber proposed in 2016 to resolve the case, which U.S. District Judge Edward Chen at the time rejected as an inadequate amount. The new settlement, which still must be approved by Chen, was filed in federal court in San Francisco late Monday night. The lawsuit is central to a widely held debate over so-called gig-economy workers, the workforce assigned by technology platforms such as food-delivery and ride-hailing services. Gig-economy workers have often argued they should receive better pay and benefits, and be treated as employees. A California Supreme Court ruling last year made it much more difficult for companies like Uber to argue that their drivers are independent contractors, which poses a threat to UberÃ¢ÂÂs business model. The Uber settlement covers drivers in California and Massachusetts who have driven for Uber from August 2009 through February this year, according to the filing. The class is much smaller than in 2016 when the initial settlement offer was made. Following ChenÃ¢ÂÂs rejection of that offer, Uber won an appeals court ruling that upheld the companyÃ¢ÂÂs arbitration agreements as largely valid and enforceable. That forced most drivers into arbitration, and reduced the class size involved in the class-action lawsuit. REUTERS.

IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs engineers struggle for work as jobs crisis worsens,"CHINCHWAD: Santosh Gurav gained a bachelorÃ¢ÂÂs degree in technology from a mid-tier college in western India last year, specializing in electrical engineering and hoping to land a job in industrial automation. Six months on, the 27-year-old repairs mixer-grinders, table fans and other household appliances at a cramped shop in the western city of Pune. On better days, he picks up broken LED lights from scrap dealers, fixes them, then sells them. He earns about $50 a month, just enough to cover the rent for the room he shares with two others as his home. Ã¢ÂÂI havenÃ¢ÂÂt even started repaying my education loan,Ã¢ÂÂ said Gurav, referring to the nearly $4,000 heÃ¢ÂÂd borrowed for his undergraduate study. He is one of hundreds of thousands of engineers Ã¢ÂÂ studying everything from computer code to civil engineering Ã¢ÂÂ that IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs education system churns out each year, many with large loans and little prospect of finding a job in their field. They highlight Prime Minister Narendra ModiÃ¢ÂÂs difficulty in fulfilling a promise he made weeks after coming to power in 2014: creating millions of jobs by boosting manufacturing under a flagship Ã¢ÂÂMake in IndiaÃ¢ÂÂ project launched with much fanfare. Ã¢ÂÂCome, Make in India, we will say to the world, from electrical to electronics,Ã¢ÂÂ Modi said in his maiden Independence Day speech as prime minister, pledging to create up to 100 million new jobs by 2022. NO ECHOES OF CHINA BOOM Four years on, the programÃ¢ÂÂs impact on job creation is unclear and growth in the manufacturing sector has been sluggish, partly due to a lack of land and labor reform. IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs unemployment rate rose to 7.2 percent last month, up from 5.9 percent in February 2018, according to data compiled by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) think tank. The figures are more recent than government data and many economists regard them as more credible. The data, which is an estimate based on household surveys, shows 31.2 million people were actively looking for jobs in February this year, said Mahesh Vyas, the CMIE managing director. It did not have a breakup for engineering or technology graduates. With more than half of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs population under 25 years of age, critics say the votes of jobless youth could hurt ModiÃ¢ÂÂs chances of securing a second term in the upcoming general election to be held in April-May. The increasing use of automation in industry, the massive number of young Indians coming onto the job market, and the regulatory hurdles that companies still face if they want to set up shop in India, are all big issues for those without work.

ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs main bourses clawed back almost half the 4 percent they lost on Friday as the countryÃ¢ÂÂs central bank chief pledged billions of dollars of cuts to taxes and fees to shore up an economy growing at its slowest pace in almost 30 years.

On Monday, Apple also is expected to unveil an Apple News subscription option featuring content from major publishers and a new credit card with Goldman Sachs to bolster Apple Pay. NOT TAKING ON NETFLIX While Apple plans to spend $2 billion on original shows this year and has hired Hollywood veterans to oversee them, it is unlikely to take on Netflix or Amazon directly by including libraries of older shows. Instead, its model is expected to more closely resemble the App Store, offering paid subscriptions to other media companiesÃ¢ÂÂ programming and keeping a cut of sales. Ahead of the launch, Apple negotiated deals that would let Apple bundle and sell networks at a discount, replicating a business model from the cable TV industry, one source familiar with the matter said. AppleÃ¢ÂÂs goal, other sources have told Reuters, is to bring together television shows in one place to make it easier to find, buy and watch them. Apple has worked to make it easier to watch the shows on traditional television from manufacturers such as Sony Corp, VIZIO Inc, LG Electronics Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. AppleÃ¢ÂÂs pitch to Hollywood is that it has the potential to reach hundreds of millions of viewers. The company said in January there were 1.4 billion active Apple devices, 900 million of which are iPhones. It has positioned that as leverage against NetflixÃ¢ÂÂs 139 million global customers and the 100 million subscribers to AmazonÃ¢ÂÂs Prime shipping program, which includes the video service. But the Silicon Valley company has a history of making quick progress when coming from behind: It launched its Apple Music streaming service years after rival Spotify Technology SA but has garnered 50 million listeners, nearly half of SpotifyÃ¢ÂÂs 96 million premium subscribers. And Apple in January said its Apple News service had 85 million active users after being released less than four years ago. REUTERS.

Ã¢ÂÂSimpsonsÃ¢ÂÂ producer pulls episode featuring Michael Jackson,"An old episode of Ã¢ÂÂThe SimpsonsÃ¢ÂÂ featuring the voice of Michael Jackson is being pulled from all future broadcasts, the showÃ¢ÂÂs producer told a newspaper, following a documentary about alleged child abuse by the late pop star. Ã¢ÂÂIt feels clearly the only choice to make,Ã¢ÂÂ James L. Brooks was quoted as telling the Wall Street Journal. The long-running cartoon show featured Jackson in 1991, during its third series, in a episode called Ã¢ÂÂStark Raving DadÃ¢ÂÂ. He voiced a character in a psychiatric ward who believed he was the pop star. Media representatives for Ã¢ÂÂThe SimpsonsÃ¢ÂÂ were not immediately available for further comment. In the documentary, Ã¢ÂÂLeaving NeverlandÃ¢ÂÂ, two adult men say they were befriended by Jackson and abused by him from the ages of 7 and 10 in the early 1990s. It prompted a mixture of horror and disbelief when it ran on U.S. cable channel HBO on Sunday and Monday. Some radio stations in Canada and the Netherlands stopped playing JacksonÃ¢ÂÂs music. JacksonÃ¢ÂÂs family called the documentary and news coverage of the accusations a Ã¢ÂÂpublic lynchingÃ¢ÂÂ and said he was Ã¢ÂÂ100 percent innocent.Ã¢ÂÂ His estate filed a lawsuit against HBO in February, saying the program breached an agreement that the cable channel would not disparage Jackson. The Ã¢ÂÂThrillerÃ¢ÂÂ singer, who died in 2009, was acquitted in 2005 of charges of molesting a 13-year-old boy, unrelated to the documentary, at his Neverland ranch in California. In 1994, he settled a sexual abuse lawsuit concerning another 13-year-old boy. Reuters.

"Actor Jan-Michael Vincent, known for Ã¢ÂÂAirwolf,Ã¢ÂÂ dies at 73","Actor Jan-Michael Vincent, the Ã¢ÂÂAirwolfÃ¢ÂÂ television star whose sleek good looks belied a troubled personal life, has died. He was 73. A death certificate shows that Vincent died of cardiac arrest on Feb. 10, 2019, in an Asheville, North Carolina, hospital. The certificate signed by a doctor says he died of natural causes and no autopsy was performed. It wasnÃ¢ÂÂt clear why it took several weeks for news of the death to surface before it was first reported Friday by TMZ. Messages left at phone listings for Vincent and his wife werenÃ¢ÂÂt immediately returned Friday. Born in 1945 in Denver, Colorado, Vincent starred in such films as 1972Ã¢ÂÂ²s Ã¢ÂÂThe MechanicÃ¢ÂÂ and 1978Ã¢ÂÂ²s Ã¢ÂÂHooper,Ã¢ÂÂ in which he played a stuntman opposite Burt Reynolds. Off-screen, his handsomeness earned him a spot on a cosmetic surgeonÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂTen Best NosesÃ¢ÂÂ list in the late 1970s. He also starred in the 1983 television mini-series Ã¢ÂÂWinds of WarÃ¢ÂÂ as the love interest of a character played by Ali MacGraw, Ã¢ÂÂpiling up enormous ratings,Ã¢ÂÂ according to a contemporary Associated Press account. He earned a Golden Globe nomination. In a 1984 AP interview, Vincent described his passion for being on the water. He said he spent three months after wrapping up Ã¢ÂÂWinds of WarÃ¢ÂÂ sailing the Caribbean. He also said he was a longtime surfer. Ã¢ÂÂI was a traveling surfer for years. Ã¢ÂÂ¦ IÃ¢ÂÂve been all over the world surfing,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂll be 40 in July and I still like to surf.Ã¢ÂÂ Perhaps his best-known role was in the television action-adventure series Ã¢ÂÂAirwolf,Ã¢ÂÂ which lasted for several seasons after launching in 1984. Vincent played pilot Stringfellow Hawke, a rugged pilot who could pull off aerobatic crime-fighting maneuvers in an advanced helicopter Ã¢ÂÂ but also play the cello. In the AP interview, he described trying to find the right way to loosen the character up. Ã¢ÂÂThe character is stiff,Ã¢ÂÂ he says, Ã¢ÂÂbut as weÃ¢ÂÂve gone along weÃ¢ÂÂve been able to loosen him some. Now youÃ¢ÂÂll sometimes see him crack a smile and say something funny. Even Clint Eastwood is mellowing, although IÃ¢ÂÂll never be Burt Reynolds.Ã¢ÂÂ However, his surfer-like demeanor was overshadowed at times by his troubled personal life. He pleaded guilty in 1997 to a drunken driving accident that left him with a broken neck and was sentenced to a rehab program. He was also charged in 1980s barroom brawls, receiving probation in one and an acquittal in another. In a separate case, he was acquitted in 1986 of hitting a woman. He was sentenced to 60 days in jail in 2000 in Orange County, California, after he admitted to violating his probation by appearing drunk in public and assaulting his then-girlfriend. AP.

If it does win, it will be the first foreign-language film, and the first from streaming giant Netflix, to earn the honor. But civil rights dramedyGreen Bookhas overcome controversy to remain on the radar, and could benefit from the AcademyÃ¢ÂÂs complex preferential voting system to snatch the top prize. Hot on their heels are a variety of films, from offbeat royal rompThe Favourite(also with 10 nominations), to Spike LeeÃ¢ÂÂs race dramaBlacKkKlansman, to crowd pleasers like superhero flickBlack Pantherand musical romanceA Star Is Born. Two biopics Ã¢ÂÂViceabout former US vice president Dick Cheney andBohemian Rhapsodyabout the band QueenÃ¢ÂÂ round out the list of contenders for best picture.

All will be revealed at the Dolby Theatre, in a ceremony beamed around the world to millions of showbiz fans, with a twistÃ¢ÂÂ there will be no host for the first time in three decades. The Academy opted to take the risk after comedian Kevin Hart withdrew from the gig in the face of a firestorm over past controversial tweets that were slammed as homophobic. Ã¢ÂÂThey still donÃ¢ÂÂt have an answer to a question thatÃ¢ÂÂs been around since the first TV showing in 1953: is this a presentation of every category, or is it entertainment?Ã¢ÂÂ Gray said.

Respect your arts and artists,"Something shouldÃ¢ÂÂve been said a while ago but there is no better time than now and there is no better place than here. Why are we so persistent with belittling and putting down people who become artists in this country, why do we take them for granted? Why are the arts looked down upon and the people who partake in what I understand to be one of the most noble acts on earth are treated as outsiders and black sheepÃ¢ÂÂs? Why is the Ã¢ÂÂIndustryÃ¢ÂÂ so reluctant in owning up to and standing up for their due rights? Or, Why is the Ã¢ÂÂindustryÃ¢ÂÂ hell bent on destroying whatever they had or have? When will the Ã¢ÂÂKill your darlingsÃ¢ÂÂ mentality of this desensitized nation which has been raised believing that Bollywood and India are the be all and end all to what is known and revered as art in the subcontinent? When will our own icons and legends be given the hard earned and much deserved respect in their own homeland? Why is this so difficult a task? I can rant on this for hours, the downfall of the POP juggernaut which was the Pakistan music scene in the 80Ã¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ 90Ã¢ÂÂs and early 2000Ã¢ÂÂs and why and what happened and how us the nation of Pakistan and the artists themselves played a part in killing the Ã¢ÂÂmagicÃ¢ÂÂ. To sum up the collective human psyche and more importantly to accurately encompass the Pakistani mentality towards arts, a Fyodor Dostoevsky quote comes to mind. Ã¢ÂÂMen reject their prophets and slay them, but they love their martyrs and honor those that they have slain.Ã¢ÂÂ But, this is not about arts, itÃ¢ÂÂs about respect. How dare people take people who have been entertaining and performing for decades in this country taken for granted for this long? Why are we so thick skinned when it comes to doing things by the book, when will this moral corruption and degeneration cease? Not too soon it seems, What is fast becoming PakistanÃ¢ÂÂs crown jewel with regards to optics and portrayal of the country as a peace loving and harmonious state, the Pakistan Super League has played a pivotal role. All my respects and praise for the monumental efforts that made the PSL a monumental smash success and I pray that the trend continues for as long as can be but the opening ceremony left a very unsavory taste in the mouth when a remix of an old and ever popular tune made famous by the legendary pop-duo of Nazia and Zoheb Hassan hit the speakers and shortly after the ceremony, Zoheb Hassan rightly tweeted out how his intellectual property was taken (stolen) without his prior consent by the event and itÃ¢ÂÂs producers. 
Many in the fraternity rolled their eyes on the tweet when Zoheb said that he will sue the producers for doing so, one claimed, Ã¢ÂÂfirst they want their work featured on a grand stage and when it is featured they make hue and cry over these negligible details of semantics and permissions.Ã¢ÂÂ I was livid reading this response, I know by personal experiences and friendships with a few people close to and working in the industry how tough it is to make a living in a country like Pakistan where piracy has always been rampant, the situation on-ground making it impossible for live events to happen for the longest time depriving artists and performers to make a living, then came the highly touted multinational brands with mega corporate deals and bags of promises assuring the artist a hefty repay on their art which they are entitled to and have deserved all along in the first place. They were promised royalties, and big paychecks but what an artist has always ever been demanding is common human decency. It is criminal to ask an artist to do something for free by baiting him with words like exposure and outreach, the artists themselves must also stand up against such nefarious and thankless people and activities. Everyone has mouths to feed and bills to pay and even if the artist is financially secure even then it is criminal under law to use something which is their intellectual property without permission. This needs to be sorted for good. Another song taken but falling short of following lawful procedure has been from a famous reality tv/music show and people involved in making of the original have expressed their displeasure.  People need to get their act together, give people their due right and stop this exploitation and careless attitude.

Facebook is one of the biggest global players in private messaging, with its WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram services, each having more than 1 billion users.

FacebookÃ¢ÂÂs Zuckerberg confident of stopping interference in 2020 campaign,"Facebook IncÃ¢ÂÂs Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg is confident the worldÃ¢ÂÂs biggest social network will do better in 2020 at stopping Ã¢ÂÂbad actorsÃ¢ÂÂ from manipulating the US presidential election. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂve learned a lot since 2016, where, obviously, we were behind where we needed to be on defenses for nation states trying to interfere,Ã¢ÂÂ he said in a Ã¢ÂÂGood Morning AmericaÃ¢ÂÂ interview released on Thursday. Ã¢ÂÂThese arenÃ¢ÂÂt things that you ever fully solve, right? TheyÃ¢ÂÂre ongoing arms races, where we need to make sure that our systems stay ahead of the sophisticated bad actors, who are just always going to try to game them.Ã¢ÂÂ US intelligence agencies say there was an extensive Russian cyber-influence operation during the 2016 campaign aimed at helping Donald Trump, a Republican, defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations. Zuckerberg said here the social media giant had implemented a lot of different measures since 2016 to verify any advertiser who is running a political ad and create an archive so anyone could see what advertisers are running, who they are targeting and how much they are paying. Advertising practices at Facebook, the worldÃ¢ÂÂs largest social network with 2.7 billion users and $56 billion in annual revenue, have been in the spotlight for two years amid growing discontent over its approach to privacy and user data. The company said in a congressional testimony last year that Russian agents created 129 events on the network during the 2016 US election campaign, shedding more light on RussiaÃ¢ÂÂs purported disinformation drive aimed at voters. Ã¢ÂÂAt this point, (we) have probably some of the most-advanced systems of any company or government in the world for preventing the kind of tactics that Russia and now other countries, as well, have tried,Ã¢ÂÂ Zuckerberg said. Asked if he could guarantee that there would not be interference in the election, Zuckerberg said, Ã¢ÂÂWhat I can guarantee is that theyÃ¢ÂÂre definitely going to try.Ã¢ÂÂ REUTERS.

"FB opens innovation Lab in Lahore, boosting tech innovation in Pakistan","LAHORE: Facebook and PakistanÃ¢ÂÂs Ministry of Information Technology & Telecom along with the National Technology Fund (IGNITE) launched the first Facebook Innovation Lab in Pakistan at a ceremony attended by policy makers and technocrats on Wednesday.  Located in the National Incubation Center (NIC) at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), the Innovation Lab will focus on providing infrastructure access to developers, entrepreneurs and community groups enabling them to network, train and grow their expertise. It will also help developers build products and applications using emerging technology like Virtual Reality (VR). Ã¢ÂÂWe are proud to launch Facebook Innovation Lab as a part of our long term commitment to support innovation and the developer community in Pakistan. Facebook is committed to building an impactful community in Pakistan and we believe it is important to support businesses, startups and the individuals who are driving innovation to grow and succeed. We are confident that through our partnership with the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecom, Ignite, National Incubation Centre (NIC) Lahore, and LUMS, Facebook Innovation Lab will not only be a unique training and innovation center, but will support a vibrant and transformative technology community in the country,Ã¢ÂÂ saidJason Lin, Head of Startup Programs (APAC), Facebook. This is the first innovation lab launched by Facebook in Pakistan. The Lab will give startups the infrastructure and the access they need to refine and scale their business models so they can succeed in Pakistan and scale internationally. The lab not only provides a showcase of the latest technology, but participants will be matched with mentors, as well as connect with FacebookÃ¢ÂÂs global and exclusive experts, industry leaders, and specialists in product innovation, business growth, and data protection. Attending the launch, Yusuf Hussain, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ignite said, Ã¢ÂÂAugmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence are rapidly expanding and will be major sectors of the future.

Facebook discloses the algorithm behind news feed,"LONDON: Facebook is lifting the lid on the algorithm that decides which posts appear in its news feed, as part of a drive to be more transparent and offer greater control to users. The feature Ã¢ÂÂWhy am I seeing this post?Ã¢ÂÂ, being rolled out from Monday, offers some insight into the tens of thousands of inputs used by the social network to rank stories, photos and video in the news feed, the foundation of the platform. Ã¢ÂÂThe basic thing that this tool does is let people see why they are seeing a particular post in their news feed, and it helps them access the actions they might want to take if they want to change that,Ã¢ÂÂ FacebookÃ¢ÂÂs Head of News Feed John Hegeman told reporters on Monday. After a series of privacy scandals, Facebook needs to regain usersÃ¢ÂÂ trust as it prepares to roll out a single messaging service combining Facebook messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram that could make it even more central to usersÃ¢ÂÂ communications. The new news feed feature will show users the data that connect them to a particular type of post, Hegeman said, for example that they are friends with the poster and theyÃ¢ÂÂve liked their posts more than others, theyÃ¢ÂÂve frequently commented on that type of post before, or that the post is popular with users with the same interests. It will detail some of the interactions that lead the algorithm to reach its conclusion, he said, although it will not show all of the thousands of inputs that influence the decision. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂve tried to really focus on the signals that are most important and play the biggest role in what causes people to see a post or not,Ã¢ÂÂ Hegeman said. Ã¢ÂÂWe donÃ¢ÂÂt think this is going to solve everything on the theme of transparency but we think this is an important step.Ã¢ÂÂ Facebook developed the new tool with research groups in New York, Denver, Paris and Berlin, he said, and as a result of feedback Facebook has made it easy for users to access tools to control what is in the news feed themselves. Facebook is also updating its Ã¢ÂÂWhy Am I Seeing this Ad?Ã¢ÂÂ feature launched a few years ago with additional details, Hegeman said, such as explaining how ads work that target customers using email lists. The company shifted its strategy for its centrepiece news feed in early 2018 when it decided to prioritize posts from family and friends and downgrade non-advertising content from publishers and brands.

New Australian laws could see social media execs jailed over terror images,"Australia pledged Saturday to introduce new laws that could see social media executives jailed and tech giants fined billions for failing to remove extremist material from their platforms. The tough new legislation will be brought to parliament next week as Canberra pushes for social media companies to prevent their platforms from being Ã¢ÂÂweaponisedÃ¢ÂÂ by terrorists in the wake of the Christchurch mosque attacks. Facebook said it Ã¢ÂÂquicklyÃ¢ÂÂ removed a staggering 1.5 million videos of the white supremacist massacre livestreamed on the social media platform. A 17-minute video of the March 15 rampage that claimed the lives of 50 people was widely available online and experts said was easily retrievable several hours after the attack. Ã¢ÂÂBig social media companies have a responsibility to take every possible action to ensure their technology products are not exploited by murderous terrorists,Ã¢ÂÂ Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement. Morrison, who met with a number of tech firms Tuesday Ã¢ÂÂ including Facebook, Twitter and Google Ã¢ÂÂ said Australia would encourage other G20 nations to hold social media firms to account. Attorney-General Christian Porter said the new laws would make it a criminal offence for platforms not to quickly take down Ã¢ÂÂabhorrent violent materialÃ¢ÂÂ like terror attacks, murder or rape. Executives could face up to three years in prison for failing to do so, he added, while social media platforms Ã¢ÂÂ whose annual revenues can stretch into the tens of billions Ã¢ÂÂ would face fines of up to ten percent of their annual turnover. Ã¢ÂÂMainstream media that broadcast such material would be putting their licence at risk and there is no reason why social media platforms should be treated any differently,Ã¢ÂÂ Porter said. The government was so far Ã¢ÂÂunderwhelmedÃ¢ÂÂ by the response from tech giants at their Tuesday meeting with Morrison, communications minister Mitch Fifield told reporters Saturday. But cyber-security expert Nigel Phair, from the University of New South Wales, cast doubt over the ability of proposed Australian laws to impose jail time. Ã¢ÂÂThe penalty is only for Australian domiciled executives, and on the whole theyÃÂ´re marketing executives, not those responsible for running and maintaining the platform,Ã¢ÂÂ he told broadcaster SBS earlier this week.

"Facebook forbids white nationalism, white separatism on its platforms","Facebook Inc on Wednesday banned praise, support and representation of white nationalism and white separatism on its social media platforms, bolstering its efforts to tackle hate speech. The policy will be enforced next week, the social media giant said in a blog here post. Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet IncÃ¢ÂÂs YouTube are under pressure to remove white supremacist and neo-Nazi content from their platforms. In response, Facebook has beefed up its content monitoring teams and has taken down event pages that were used to promote and organize rallies by White supremacy groups. The company previously allowed some white nationalist content it did not view as racist, but recently decided to change course. Ã¢ÂÂOver the past three months our conversations with members of civil society and academics who are experts in race relations around the world have confirmed that white nationalism and separatism cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups,Ã¢ÂÂ the company said.

Modi hails major breakthrough as India shoots down satellite in space,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India had shot down a satellite in space on Wednesday with an anti-satellite missile, hailing the test as a major breakthrough in its space programme. Modi made the announcement in a television address to the nation. He said India would only be the fourth country to have used such an anti-satellite weapon after the United States, Russia and China. Such capabilities have raised fears of the weaponisation of space and setting off a race between rival powers. Ã¢ÂÂSome time ago, our scientists, shot down a live satellite 300 kilometres away in space, in low-earth orbit,Ã¢ÂÂ Modi said, calling it a historic feat. Ã¢ÂÂIndia has made an unprecedented achievement today,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, speaking in Hindi. Ã¢ÂÂIndia registered its name as a space power.Ã¢ÂÂ Modi faces a general election next month. He went on Twitter earlier to announce his plan for a national broadcast, saying he had an important announcement to make. India has had a space programme for years, making earth imaging satellites and launch capabilities as a cheaper alternative to Western programmes. Brahma Chellaney, a security expert at New DelhiÃ¢ÂÂs Centre of Policy Research, said the United States, Russia and China were pursuing anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons. Ã¢ÂÂSpace is being turned into a battlefront, making counter-space capabilities critical. In this light, IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs successful Ã¢ÂÂkillÃ¢ÂÂ with an ASAT weapon is significant.Ã¢ÂÂ No comment was immediately available from old rival Pakistan.

Facebook fixes fault that displayed millions of user passwords to employees,"Facebook Inc said on Thursday it has resolved a glitch that exposed passwords of millions of users stored in readable format within its internal systems to its employees. The passwords were accessible to as many as 20,000 Facebook employees and dated back as early as 2012, cyber security blog KrebsOnSecurity, which first reported said in its report. Ã¢ÂÂThese passwords were never visible to anyone outside of Facebook and we have found no evidence to date that anyone internally abused or improperly accessed them,Ã¢ÂÂ the company said. KrebsOnSecurity, citing a senior Facebook employee, said the an internal investigation by the company so far indicates that between 200 million and 600 million Facebook users may have had their account passwords stored in plain text. Facebook said the issue was discovered in January as part of a routine security review. Majority of the affected were users of Facebook Lite, a version of the social media app largely used by people in regions with lower connectivity. The social network is also probing the causes of a series of security failures, in which employees built applications that logged unencrypted password data for Facebook users, the report said. Ã¢ÂÂWe estimate that we will notify hundreds of millions of Facebook Lite users, tens of millions of other Facebook users, and tens of thousands of Instagram users,Ã¢ÂÂ the company said. REUTERS.

U.S. top court undermines Google settlement in internet privacy case,"WASHINGTON: The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday cast doubt on a $8.5 million settlement Google had agreed to pay to end an internet privacy dispute, directing a lower court to review whether plaintiffs who accused the search engine operator of wrongdoing in a class action lawsuit were legally eligible to sue. The plaintiffs had argued that Google, part of Alphabet Inc., violated federal privacy law by allowing other websites to see usersÃ¢ÂÂ search queries. The justices threw out a ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that had upheld the settlement and directed it to take a fresh look at whether the plaintiffs had actually been harmed by Google and had the necessary legal standing. The dispute centered on an increasingly common type of settlement in class action cases used when it might be impractical to carve up low-value individual damages among a large number of plaintiffs. In endorsing the Google settlement in 2017, 9th Circuit said each of the 129 million U.S. Google users who theoretically could have claimed part of it would have received Ã¢ÂÂa paltry 4 cents in recovery.Ã¢ÂÂ Proponents have said these Ã¢ÂÂcy presÃ¢ÂÂ (pronounced Ã¢ÂÂsee prayÃ¢ÂÂ) settlements can put otherwise negligible awards per person to good use by benefiting groups that work for the public good or support underfunded entities. Critics have said the settlements encourage frivolous lawsuits and excessive fees going to plaintiffsÃ¢ÂÂ lawyers. The Google settlement was challenged by attorneys including Ted Frank of the Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute, which advocates against what it considers abusive class action procedures. The plaintiffs in the case alleged that their privacy was violated when their search terms were disseminated by Google to other sites. One searched for her own name, another for financial and health data, and a third for information related to his divorce proceedings. REUTERS.

Google announces browser-based streaming game service,"SAN FRANCISCO: Alphabet IncÃ¢ÂÂs Google announced on Tuesday a video game streaming service dubbed Stadia that attempts to capitalize on the companyÃ¢ÂÂs cloud technology and global network of data centers. The technology allows users to play games on their internet browser without having to wait for any content to be downloaded to their device, making access to games potentially as easy as watching a video from YouTube. Ã¢ÂÂStadia offers instant access to play,Ã¢ÂÂ Phil Harrison, a Google vice president overseeing the new service, said during a keynote presentation on Tuesday in San Francisco at the Game Developers Conference, which is bringing together this week about 25,000 people who work in the video games industry. Google has endured mixed results in gaming. Video games are the best-selling category on its app store for Android mobile devices. It sold an estimated $21.5 billion worth of games last year, according to research firm Sensor Tower. And gaming is among the top three categories on the Google-owned video service YouTube. But Apple IncÃ¢ÂÂs App Store sold about $33 billion worth of games last year, and the games industry views Amazon.com IncÃ¢ÂÂs Twitch, rather than YouTube, as the most popular video streaming service for content related to video games. GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs efforts to popularize games on virtual reality headsets stumbled. Harrison said Stadia would work on desktops, laptops, TVs connected to Chromecast streaming media sticks, tablets and phones. Players can control their characters using mice and keyboards, USB controllers or a new WiFi-enabled controller developed by Google. Several technology companies are looking to boost services revenue by experimenting with games streaming, including Sony Corp, Nvidia Corp and Microsoft Corp. Though users may be attracted to the idea of quick access to games from any device, they may not get all the games they want. Financial analysts have questioned whether the tech companies will be able to charge consumers prices high enough to attract top game publishers that have a lucrative business selling games on discs. Game publishers also may decide to launch their own streaming services, as film and TV studios have begun doing for their content in the last few years. Google had launched a test of Project Stream last October, inviting users to play Ubisoft Entertainment SAÃ¢ÂÂs new game AssassinÃ¢ÂÂs Creed Odyssey from their web browsers for free. REUTERS.

Game maker Rovio ventures into augmented reality with new Angry Birds game,"HELSINKI: Finnish game company Rovio has released an augmented reality game called Angry Birds Isle of Pigs, developed with Swedish game studio Resolution Games for AppleÃ¢ÂÂs mobile devices, the Finnish games developer said on Tuesday. The release, announced at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, came in addition to the two games the company had promised to release this year, one of which is already out. Rovio, mostly known for its Angry Birds products, said the gameÃ¢ÂÂs augmented reality element allowed players to overlay its three-dimension environment onto their own surroundings such as a table, by viewing it through an iPhone or iPad. The game Ã¢ÂÂallows players to take the power of the Angry Birds slingshot into their hands like never before, placing the classic piggy constructed towers into the playerÃ¢ÂÂs own environment using AppleÃ¢ÂÂs ARKit technology,Ã¢ÂÂ Rovio said in a statement. Rovio had previously launched another augmented reality game with Resolution Games, intended for a gaming headset developed by Magic Leap. Apple has also been developing its own lenses for augmented reality glasses. The new game is RovioÃ¢ÂÂs first attempt at bringing an augmented reality product to mobile phones and pads. It is first available for pre-order on AppleÃ¢ÂÂs App Store for iPhone 6s and later on for iPads, the company said. In February, Rovio said it expected sales to grow this year, buoyed by new game launches and a movie release, after its fourth-quarter adjusted operating profit halved. REUTERS.

With high-tech glasses Japanese ALS patient makes the beat go on,"TOKYO: The music booms and lights flash as Masatane Muto, a wheelchair-bound disc jockey, uses is eyes to put on a show at a recent Tokyo music festival. Muto, who lost the use of his hands to Lou GehrigÃ¢ÂÂs Disease, wears a pair of high-tech glasses connected to an app that controls music-mixing software. Ã¢ÂÂThrough my performance, I hope to show that everybody should be given the chance to express themselves,Ã¢ÂÂ Muto, 32, told Reuters Television after performing at the J-Wave Innovation World Festa. Muto was a 27-year-old advertising executive when he was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou GehrigÃ¢ÂÂs Disease Ã¢ÂÂ a progressive neurological disease in which patients gradually lose control of most of their muscles, though mental function remains unimpaired. The disease, which gained prominence in 2014 through the Ã¢ÂÂIce Bucket ChallengeÃ¢ÂÂ global video fundraising campaign, is terminal, with most patients dying within three to five years of their diagnosis. There is currently no treatment. On the train home after his diagnosis, Muto vowed to make the rest of his life as innovative and creative as possible. He quit his job and founded the group Ã¢ÂÂWITH ALSÃ¢ÂÂ to raise awareness of the disease and help other patients live their lives to the fullest. Muto dreamed of being a disc jockey and tracked down the latest technology to make it happen. Now a radio personality, he performs as a disc and video jockey under the moniker Ã¢ÂÂEYE VDJÃ¢ÂÂ, mixing music with smart eyewear that detects his eye movements and allows him to use an app connected to music-mixing software. A three-point sensor on the nose pad of the JINS MEME glasses detects subtle electronic changes in the surrounding skin which are caused by blinking or movement of the eyes. The eyeglasses sell for 27,300 yen ($245) a pair, cheaper than many other eye-tracking devices. The source code for JINS MEME has been released to the public in the hope that others will find their own ways of using it, Muto said. Ã¢ÂÂALS is thought to be an incurable disease, but I believe hope is now growing for ALS patients to pursue their lifestyle and quality of life with the help of technology,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Muto said his next dream is to perform at the opening ceremonies of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2020.

Google faces third EU antitrust fine next week,"BRUSSELS: Alphabet unit Google is likely to be hit with a third EU antitrust fine next week related to its AdSense advertising service, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday, with the sanction expected to be much smaller than previous fines. The European Commission in 2016 opened a third case against the worldÃ¢ÂÂs most popular internet search engine by accusing Google of preventing third parties using its AdSense product from displaying search advertisements from GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs competitors. It said that Google, which at that time had held 80 percent of the European market for search advertising intermediation over the previous ten years, had kept its anti-competitive practices for a decade. In response, Google changed the conditions in its AdSense contracts with large third parties, giving them more leeway to display competing search ads.

Ã¢ÂÂThis means we can find this content before anyone reports it.Ã¢ÂÂ A member of FacebookÃ¢ÂÂs community operations team would review the content found by the new technology, and if found to be an offending image, remove it or disable the account responsible for spreading it, the company added. Ã¢ÂÂRevenge pornÃ¢ÂÂ refers to the sharing of sexually explicit images on the internet, without the consent of the people depicted in the pictures, in order to extort or humiliate them. The practice disproportionately affects women, who are sometimes targeted by former partners. Facebook will also launch a support hub called Ã¢ÂÂNot Without My ConsentÃ¢ÂÂ on its safety center page for people whose intimate images have been shared without their consent.

Pope criticizes building walls to keep migrants out,"ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE: Pope Francis said Sunday political leaders who want walls and other barriers to keep migrants out Ã¢ÂÂwill end up becoming prisoners of the walls they buildÃ¢ÂÂ. The pope made his comments to reporters aboard the plane returning from Morocco in response to a question about migration in general and about US President Donald TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs threat to shut down the southern border with Mexico. Ã¢ÂÂBuilders of walls, be they made of razor wire or bricks, will end up becoming prisoners of the walls they build,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Francis, who did not mention Trump in his response, has sparred with the US president before over migration, which was a theme of several questions on the plane as well as during the trip to Morocco. Trump has declared a national emergency to justify redirecting money earmarked for the military to pay for his promised US-Mexico border wall. Ã¢ÂÂI realize that with this problem (of migration), a government has a hot potato in its hands, but it must be resolved differently, humanely, not with razor wire,Ã¢ÂÂ the Argentine-born pope said on the plane. Addressing Moroccan leaders on Saturday, Francis said problems of migration would never be resolved by physical barriers but instead required social justice and correcting the worldÃ¢ÂÂs economic imbalances. Ã¢ÂÂWith fear, we will not move forward, with walls, we will remain closed within these walls,Ã¢ÂÂ he said on Sunday. Besides the United States, migration has again risen to the fore of national political debates in a number of North African and European countries. On the plane, Francis repeated some of the key points of his views on migration. He said wealthy countries should help eliminate the root causes of migration such as poverty, war, and political instability. Migrants should be accepted, protected and integrated and if a country cannot handle the numbers, the migrants should be distributed among other countries, he said. Reuters.

Pakistan leaps eight spots on UN happier countries index,"KARACHI: Pakistanis may indulge in numerous tribulations every day, but they cheerfully get ahead of those tribulations Ã¢ÂÂ at least thatÃ¢ÂÂs what United Nations World Happiness Index implies. The latest rankings see Pakistan leap eight spots from 2018 to become 67th happiest nation of the world. The 2019 report Ã¢ÂÂwhich outlines countriesÃ¢ÂÂ progression since 2005 Ã¢ÂÂ also places Pakistan among the top 20 gainers ranked on the index. Adversary India was ranked among 20 biggest losers after it plummeted seven spots from previous year to 140 on the list. Just like previous year, Pakistan stayed the happiest country in South Asia, trail by Bhutan at 95. Other Asian countries on the list included: Nepal 100, Bangladesh 125, Sri Lanka 130, and Afghanistan, the least happiest Asian country, ranked 154. The top 5 spot was held by Scandinavian countries, continuing from last year, with Finland becoming the most happiest nation of the world, ranked #1, followed by Denmark and Norway. Top ten countries were Iceland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, New Zealand, Canada and Austria  South Sudan found themselves ranked 156, declared the unhappiest country of the world where, around 60% of population is grappling with food uncertainty in a post civil war region. The survey grades 157 nations by the extent of happiness their citizens identify themselves to be and every year, happiness is appraised by the usage of different markers. The current survey centered on six variables that sustain welfare, such as income per capita, life span, social support, independence, magnanimity and corruption. While the measure of happiness has been successfully conducted in the seventh consecutive year, the project is not without its detractors as they showed uncertainty at the Ã¢ÂÂquantificationÃ¢ÂÂ of a feeling as intangible as happiness can be done. While some call attention to increasing suicide rates widespread in the urbanized nations with the constantly raising reliance on anti-depressants in countries such as Denmark and Iceland. Report is conceived with keeping emerging science of happiness in mind, writers of the report claim.

Canadian couple builds worldÃ¢ÂÂs largest snow maze,"A-maze-ing: a snow labyrinth in the frigid, windswept prairies of Western Canada has broken the record for the worldÃÂ´s biggest. According to Guinness World Records, the whopping 2,789.11 square meters (30,0021.73 square feet) of terrain dwarfs the previous Canadian record holder at the Fort William Historical Park in Thunder Bay, Ontario. For years, farmers Clint and Angie Masse would ring in the fall harvest by building a corn maze on their property just outside of the small town of St Adolphe, a short drive from Winnipeg, Manitoba. With a long, cold winter in the Canadian forecast, they decided late last year to try to extend the experience of finding oneÃÂ´s way through the network of paths and hedges by several months. And despite temperatures plunging to a low of -40 degrees Celsius (-40 Fahrenheit) in January, people kept coming in droves. But it was no easy feat, Clint Masse told AFP. He said building the maze required weeks of planning, tens of thousands of dollars and 370 truckloads of snow to supplement the relatively thin powder on their fields. Ã¢ÂÂMaking snow is really expensive,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, pointing to the cost of renting generators, tractors and other equipment, fuel and weeks of labor. There were design challenges too. Ã¢ÂÂYouÃÂ´re not designing a path, what you are is designing walls and every wall has a double duty: itÃÂ´s got a path on this side and a path on that side,Ã¢ÂÂ Masse said. Ã¢ÂÂI wanna say it took me a better part of a week. The corn maze I think I could do in a day and a half so itÃÂ´s a lot of more work to design.Ã¢ÂÂ The couple used commercial computer-aided design and drafting software. Inside the labyrinth, visitors walk between walls of snow that are 1.8 meters (six feet) high, and atop a layer of snow packed tightly to prevent it from melting too soon into slush under the pedestrian traffic. They are greeted by ice sculptures around several corners, and benches have been set up around campfires burning in five nooks to allow visitors to warm up before continuing on and trying to solve the puzzle. The fire pits also act as markers, which first-timers Jillian Crooks and Cassidy Wegner said were indispensable for finding their way. Ã¢ÂÂIt was fun,Ã¢ÂÂ Crooks said. Ã¢ÂÂWe just kept turning every which way. It took us a while. We didnÃÂ´t time it, we should have. Maybe like half an hour? Yep!Ã¢ÂÂ That bested the posted average of 30-45 minutes. If cold temperatures hold, the labyrinth could stay open for a few more weeks, by which time Clint Masse said he hopes to have had more than 10,000 visitors and turn a small profit. AFP.

IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs defeat in aerial dogfight with Pakistan has left them vulnerable: NYT,"IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs defeat to the Pakistan Air Force in last weekÃ¢ÂÂs aerial dogfight has exposed its Ã¢ÂÂvintageÃ¢ÂÂ military, aNew York Times reportpublished on Sunday said. Ã¢ÂÂThe aerial clash, the first by the South Asian rivals in nearly five decades, was a rare test for the Indian military Ã¢ÂÂ and it left observers a bit dumbfounded. While the challenges faced by the IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs armed forces are no secret, its loss of a plane last week to a country whose military is about half the size and receives a quarter of the funding was still telling,Ã¢ÂÂ NYTÃ¢ÂÂs South Asian correspondent Maria Abi-Habib wrote, referring to the shooting down of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs Soviet-supplied MiG-21 by the Pakistan Air Force in a dogfight inside Pakistani territory on Wednesday. IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs armed forces are in alarming shape, with 68 percent of the armyÃ¢ÂÂs equipment so old it is officially considered Ã¢ÂÂvintageÃ¢ÂÂ. If intense warfare broke out tomorrow, India could supply its troops with only 10 days of ammunition, according to government estimates, the report said. Ã¢ÂÂOur troops lack modern equipment, but they have to conduct 21st-century military operations,Ã¢ÂÂ Gaurav Gogoi, an Indian lawmaker and member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defence, was quoted as saying by the newspaper. The American military began prioritising its alliance with India as its close relationship with Pakistan soured over the last two decades, the report pointed out, adding that the Ã¢ÂÂAmerican officials tasked with strengthening the alliance [with India] talk about their mission with frustration: a swollen bureaucracy makes arms sales and joint training exercises cumbersome; Indian forces are vastly underfunded; and the countryÃ¢ÂÂs navy, army and air force tend to compete rather than work together.Ã¢ÂÂ For IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs military, funding remains the biggest challenge, the report noted. Ã¢ÂÂIn 2018, India announced a military budget of some $45 billion. By comparison, ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs military budget that year was $175 billion. Last month, Delhi announced another $45 billion budget. Ã¢ÂÂIt is not just a question of how much India spends on its military, but how it spends it. The majority of the money goes to salaries for its 1.2 million active duty troops, as well as pensions. Only $14 billion will be used to buy new hardware. Ã¢ÂÂCutting troop levels so that the military can spend the money on buying modern equipment is not so simple. IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs military has long been a source of jobs for a country struggling with chronic underemployment. That is likely to be a big issue in elections scheduled for later this spring,Ã¢ÂÂ the newspaper pointed out. Ã¢ÂÂGovernment officials in New Delhi say they are struggling to improve the lives of their citizens in the most basic of ways Ã¢ÂÂ dealing with high illiteracy rates and poor sanitation infrastructure, as just two examples Ã¢ÂÂ making it hard to funnel more money toward the military at a time when China is making incursions into IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs backyard by land and seaÃ¢ÂÂ¦ Ã¢ÂÂAs the worldÃ¢ÂÂs conflicts are increasingly fought with state-of-the-art weaponry rather than the large invading armies of the past, India is falling behind. Despite being the fifth-largest military spender, only about a quarter of its military budget this year will purchase new equipment,Ã¢ÂÂ the report said. Although the purchase of military hardware is a slow-moving process in most countries, in India it moves even more sluggishly amid a swollen bureaucracy, it noted, adding that there are also concerns about corruption. Ã¢ÂÂModi is currently being grilled by the opposition over a murky $8.9 billion deal to buy 36 Rafale fighter planes from France. His political opponents have cast the agreement as corrupt in an effort to discredit him ahead of elections,Ã¢ÂÂ the article stated. The purchase will help India replace its aging fleet of MiG-21s and other jets. And on Saturday, the prime minister tried to turn the tables on the opposition, saying India would have fared better in its skirmish with Pakistan last week if it had had the Rafale jets, it added.

Ã¢ÂÂTo actually see how beautiful and big the species is in life, to hear the sound of its giant wingsÃ¢ÂÂ¦ was just incredible,Ã¢ÂÂ said Clay Bolt, a specialist bee photographer who snapped the enormous insect. Ã¢ÂÂMy dream is now to elevate this bee to a symbol of conservation in this part of Indonesia, a point of pride for the locals there.Ã¢ÂÂ The bee (full name Megachile pluto), which lives in the Indonesian island region of North Moluccas, makes its nest in termite mounds, using its large fang-like mandibles to collect sticky resin to protect its home from the termites. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists the bee as Ã¢ÂÂvulnerableÃ¢ÂÂ, meaning that while its numbers are relatively solid, the remoteness of its population makes it hard to study. Several previous expeditions to the region where the bee lives failed to spot it. Indonesia is home to an abundant variety of flora and fauna but there are fears for some animal and insect communities as forests being cut down for agriculture threaten many speciesÃÂ´ natural habitat. Ã¢ÂÂI hope this rediscovery will spark future research that will give us a deeper understanding of the life history of this very unique bee and inform any future efforts to protect it from extinction,Ã¢ÂÂ said Eli Wyman, an entomologist at Princeton University who accompanied Bolt on the trip.

Australia sees record temperatures for fourth month in a row,"Australia continued a string of Ã¢ÂÂhottest everÃ¢ÂÂ months in March, the government said Monday, as global warming emerges as the hot button issue in national elections just weeks away. The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said the country had experienced the warmest March on record, with mean maximum and minimum temperatures above average for nearly all of the vast continent nation. BOM said the national mean temperature was 2.13 degrees centigrade (3.83 degrees Fahrenheit) above the long-term average for the month of March. It was the fourth month in a row of record heat in the country, and January was AustraliaÃÂ´s hottest month ever, with mean temperatures across the continent exceeding 30 degrees Celsius for the first time. There was some relief for regions suffering from prolonged drought, however, as two tropical cyclones that struck northern and western Australia in March bought badly needed rains. Ã¢ÂÂUnfortunately, the rain needed to reduce significant rainfall deficiencies in drought-affected areas is substantial and will require above average rainfall over a prolonged period to completely remove deficits at longer timescales,Ã¢ÂÂ BOM said. Meteorologists say weather patterns over the Indian and Pacific oceans have contributed to the higher temperatures, but that long-term climate change trends were also involved. The problem of climate change has emerged as a key issue in national elections due to be held by mid-May. The conservative coalition government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been reluctant to back steep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions blamed for contributing to global warming for fear this would hurt the countryÃÂ´s huge coal industry and undermine economic growth. The main opposition Labor Party, which leads the conservatives in opinion polls, on Monday unveiled a raft of proposals to cut greenhouse gas emissions, including through promotion of renewable energy sources and electric motor vehicles.

Baby Diana? Or little Arthur? Bets on for royal baby name,"What will BritainÃ¢ÂÂs Prince Harry and his wife Meghan name their child? With the former actress in the last stage of her pregnancy, punters are having a flutter on the babyÃ¢ÂÂs gender, weight, date and birthplace. One of the most popular wagers is for the name. For a boy, Arthur is leading the pack at bookmakers William Hill but if itÃ¢ÂÂs a girl, many expect the Duke and Duchess of Sussex could pay tribute to HarryÃ¢ÂÂs late mother. Ã¢ÂÂDiana (is) 10/1 red hot favorite, no great surprises there,Ã¢ÂÂ William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams said. Ã¢ÂÂBut the recent move is for Victoria also 10/1, (people) really like it.Ã¢ÂÂ Queen ElizabethÃ¢ÂÂs grandson and his American wife, who married last May, announced in October they were expecting their first child this spring. In January, Meghan told well-wishers she was six months pregnant, adding the couple did not know the babyÃ¢ÂÂs gender. William Hill odds were 8/11 for a girl and evens for a boy earlier this week. At Betfair, the odds have shortened on a girl, and the favorite name is Diana at 5/1, Betfair Media Relations Manager Katie Baylis said. Baylis said another possibility was Alice, a name that was among those speculated when Prince William and his wife Kate were expecting their third child last year. Kate eventually gave birth to a boy, Prince Louis. Ã¢ÂÂPunters feel that there will at some point be an Alice in the royal family and so weÃ¢ÂÂve seen plenty of interest in that name as well,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. The mother of HarryÃ¢ÂÂs grandfather Prince Philip was called Alice. Betfair has odds of 8/1 for Arthur. Alice, Victoria, Grace, James and Edward each stand at 14/1. Diana and Arthur are also among favorites at other bookmakers. Other wagers have included who will be godparents to the baby, the date and time of birth, and if Meghan will have twins. Ã¢ÂÂComparative to (Prince William and Kate) the Harry betting is significantly more at this stage, so 30 odd percent (more) Ã¢ÂÂ¦ in real terms thatÃ¢ÂÂs huge,Ã¢ÂÂ Adams said. Outside Buckingham Palace, sightseers shared their name preferences. Ã¢ÂÂI would put money on a girl and Victoria (as a name) because we could call her Tori,Ã¢ÂÂ tourist Sarah Owens said.

Gender parity at work only possible if men do more at home: UN,"Progress towards gender parity at work has barely budged for the past quarter century, and will only speed up once men take on far more unpaid caregiving tasks, the UN said Thursday, on the eve of International WomenÃÂ´s Day. The UNÃÂ´s International Labour Organisation said in a fresh report that the difference in employment rates for men and women has shrunk by less than two percent in the past 27 years. In 2018, women still remained 26 percentage points less likely to be in employment than men, despite opinion polls indicating that far more women would prefer to have a job than to stay at home, the report showed. ÃÂ´Take more than 200 yearsÃÂ´ The ILO said there were a number of factors blocking equality in employment Ã¢ÂÂ the biggest being the heavy caregiving burden borne by women. Ã¢ÂÂIn the last 20 years, the amount of time women spent on unpaid care and domestic work has hardly fallen, and menÃÂ´s has increased by just eight minutes a day,Ã¢ÂÂ said Manuela Tomei, head of ILOÃÂ´s Conditions of Work and Equality Department. At this pace, she said, Ã¢ÂÂit will take more than 200 years to achieve equality in time spent in unpaid care workÃ¢ÂÂ. According to the ILO report, nearly 22 percent of women of working age worldwide Ã¢ÂÂ or 647 million Ã¢ÂÂ perform unpaid care work on a full-time basis, with the level as high as 60 percent in Arab states. By comparison, only 41 million men Ã¢ÂÂ 1.5 percent of them Ã¢ÂÂ carry out such work on a full-time basis, the report found. And women in the workplace also carry out far more of unpaid caregiving and chores at home. Ã¢ÂÂThe imbalanced division of work within the household between men and women is one of the most resilient features of gender inequality,Ã¢ÂÂ the report said. Globally, women perform more than three quarters of the total time spent on unpaid care work, and dedicate on average four hours and 25 minutes each day to unremunerated caregiving, compared to one hour and 23 minutes for men, it found. Ã¢ÂÂBecause of the disproportionate share of time spent in unpaid care work, women who work for pay are often said to work a ÃÂ´second shiftÃÂ´,Ã¢ÂÂ the report said, adding that this has negative consequences for womenÃÂ´s health and well-being, as well as advancement possibilities in the workplace. ÃÂ´Motherhood penaltyÃÂ´ The ILO said this uneven burden is largely responsible for the so-called Ã¢ÂÂmotherhood employment penaltyÃ¢ÂÂ, with mothers of young children far less likely than their childless counterparts to hold a job. At the same time, the ILO report said the gender wage gap remains at an average of 20 percent globally, and is nearly double that in countries like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The report said that differences in education levels seemed to have little to do with the differences in pay. Instead, it found that women were often given far less credit for the educations they have than their male counterparts. The report called for a range of policy changes to promote gender equality in the workplace, including more focus on social protections and support for caregivers to help level the playing field. It also called for more to be done to fight harassment and change attitudes towards women in the workplace. ILO chief Guy Ryder stressed the need to Ã¢ÂÂaccelerate action to improve progress on gender equality at workÃ¢ÂÂ. Ã¢ÂÂWe already know what needs to be done.Ã¢ÂÂ AFP.

Barbie will soon be 60 Ã¢ÂÂ and is still going strong,"She is turning 60 this year and still doesnÃÂ´t have a single wrinkle. Blonde or brunette, slender or curvy, black or white, princess or president, Barbie is a forever favorite for young girls, even if she has caused controversy over the years. The iconic doll has evolved to keep up with the times Ã¢ÂÂ check out her Twitter feed. And despite fierce competition in the toy industry, 58 million Barbies are sold each year in more than 150 countries. Ã¢ÂÂIn an industry where success today is three to five years, 60 years is a huge deal!Ã¢ÂÂ said Nathan Baynard, director of global brand marketing for Barbie. Around the world, Barbie is as universally known as Coca-Cola or McDonaldÃÂ´s, Baynard said during a recent visit to MattelÃÂ´s design studio in El Segundo, a suburb of Los Angeles. In all, more than one billion Barbie dolls have been sold since she made her debut at the American Toy Fair in New York on March 9, 1959. She was invented by Ruth Handler, the co-founder of Mattel, who was inspired by her own children to create the doll. Ã¢ÂÂHer daughter Barbara was limited in the choices of her toys Ã¢ÂÂ the only ones were baby dolls,Ã¢ÂÂ Baynard recounted. Ã¢ÂÂThe only role she could imagine through that play was caregiver, mother,Ã¢ÂÂ whereas HandlerÃÂ´s son Ã¢ÂÂcould imagine being an astronaut, cowboy, pilot, surgeon.Ã¢ÂÂ Barbie is, of course, a shortened version of Barbara. The doll was supposed to teach girls Ã¢ÂÂthat they had choices, that they could be anything. In 1959, it was a radical idea!Ã¢ÂÂ Baynard said. Barbie was an instant success. In the first year, 300,000 dolls were sold, he added. From the start, BarbieÃÂ´s pinup measurements didnÃÂ´t immediately seem all that feminist, and would spark criticism for decades to come. Ã¢ÂÂIn 1959, her body structure was exaggerated to match the aesthetics of the time and the fabric available,Ã¢ÂÂ said Barbie designer Carlyle Nuera. Since the blonde beauty first hit stores, and after a torrent of complaints over what was seen as unrealistic proportions, Mattel has made many changes Ã¢ÂÂ introducing multiple body types and dozens of skin tones. MG Lord, author of Ã¢ÂÂForever Barbie,Ã¢ÂÂ also argued that the original criticisms were unwarranted. Ã¢ÂÂShe is what the child wants her to be. How a child sees the Barbie doll is often framed by how the mother of that child feels about the idea of femininity,Ã¢ÂÂ Lord told AFP. Ã¢ÂÂThe problem here is not an 11.5-inch plastic object. The problem is the larger culture and the idea of femininity.Ã¢ÂÂ In 1965, four years before Neil Armstrong walked on the Moon, Barbie became an astronaut. In 1968, the first black Barbie doll, a friend named Christie, hit store shelves. Lisa McKnight, senior vice president and global general manager for the Barbie brand, said that today, 55 percent of the dolls sold around the world have neither blonde hair nor blue eyes. Mattel has more than 100 people working in the El Segundo design studio, a massive hangar-like building wedged between Los Angeles International Airport and a freeway. Designers begin with a simple sketch. From there on, every bit of a prototype is made by an army of experts Ã¢ÂÂ from sculpting the doll using state-of-the-art software and 3D printing to painting the face, styling the hair, choosing fabrics and crafting the clothing patterns. The entire design process for a new Barbie can last 12 to 18 months. Then, the prototype is sent from the California workshop to factories in China and Indonesia for mass production. Ã¢ÂÂSometimes, you see her on a shelf and then it gets back to you: oh yes, I designed this one!Ã¢ÂÂ Nuera said with a smile. Barbie is not only a toy store successÃ¢ÂÂ she has a massive social media presence, and is something of an Ã¢ÂÂinfluencer,Ã¢ÂÂ with millions of followers. She has an actual identity: Barbie Millicent Roberts, who hails from the made-up town of Willows in the Midwest. And now, she speaks directly to girls about her life, and important current topics. In 2018, the brand launched a sweeping campaign to help young girls close the so-called Ã¢ÂÂDream GapÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ using Barbie to teach them to believe in themselves, and not to buy into sexist gender stereotypes. Barbie has a hair stylist, makeup artist and photographer who travel with her Ã¢ÂÂfor realÃ¢ÂÂ in the United States and abroad for Instagram photo sessions (check out @barbiestyle). The account has nearly two million followers. So, does Barbie have it all as she hits 60, but remains forever young, still single and without kids (so far)? Ã¢ÂÂThe narrative of the Barbie brand is that sheÃÂ´s a young woman and sheÃÂ´s independent and pursuing careers,Ã¢ÂÂ McKnight said. AFP.

"Richest people in the world, according to Forbes","Jeff Bezos remains the worldÃ¢ÂÂs richest person, ahead of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, according to the latest Forbes list of the ultra wealthy, while far behind President Donald Trump jumped 51 spots in the ranking. While things are largely stable up on top of the list, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg dropped three spots and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg rose by two. According to the list announced Tuesday by Forbes, the riches of Bezos, 55, have swelled by $19 billion in one year and he is now worth $131 billion. Bezos, who holds 16 percent of Amazon and whose wealth now makes him a target of the left wing of the US Democratic Party, has widened the money gap between himself and Gates, the philanthropist and co-founder of Microsoft. Gates, 63, has seen his wealth grow to $96.5 billion, up from 90 billion last year, said Forbes. Third place is held by Buffett, 88 and long considered an investment guru, although he did get stung in late February by a deep plunge in shares of US processed food maker Kraft Heinz, in which he had a large stake. BuffettÃ¢ÂÂs fortune slipped by $1.5 billion to $82.5 billion, the magazine estimated. It is more or less after this trio that things start to get shaken up on the Forbes list. The CEO of French luxury good company LVMH, Bernard Arnault, held on to fourth place. But Zuckerberg lost $9 billion in net worth and slipped from fifth to eighth. Ahead of Zuckerberg now are Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim, Zara and Inditex founder Amancio Ortega of Spain, and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. Bloomberg rose from 11th to ninth place as his fortune increased to $55.5 billion, from $50 billion, said Forbes. Americans still dominate the list with 14 of the top 20 billionaires from the US. Non-Americans among the top 20 include IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, in 13th place, and ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs Ma Huateng, head of the Chinese internet giant Tencent, who rounds out the top 20. Donald Trump 715th richest
Forbes estimates TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs wealth at $3.1 billion, unchanged from last year. While 994 people from last yearÃ¢ÂÂs ranking saw their wealth drop Ã¢ÂÂ a record, according to Forbes Ã¢ÂÂ Trump rose in the Forbes ranking from 766 last year to 715 this year. TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs nine New York skyscrapers, including the famous Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, account for nearly half of his wealth, while his clubs and golf courses are valued at $550 million. However, one of TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs Florida golf clubs, the National Doral Miami, took a hit and has been depreciated by $26 million following a sharp drop in bookings attributed to disagreements with the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs policies, Forbes said. Trump is not the richest US elected official: that honor goes to JB Pritzker, a Democrat who took office as governor of Illinois in January. Pritzker, heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, was estimated to be worth $3.2 billion. AFP.

Kylie Jenner becomes youngest self-made billionaire,"LOS ANGELES: Kylie Jenner on Tuesday was named the youngest self-made billionaire of all time byForbesmagazine, thanks to the booming cosmetics company she founded three years ago. Jenner, 21, the half-sister of reality television stars Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian, made it onto the annual Forbes list of billionaires after debuting her Kylie Cosmetics online in 2015 with $29 lip kits containing matching lipstick and lip liner. Forbes said she was both the worldÃ¢ÂÂs youngest billionaire and also the youngest self-made billionaire ever. On their billionaires list, Forbes distinguishes between those who inherited much of their wealth and those who made their fortunes on their own. Kylie would be in 2,057th place whether she was self-made or inherited.  Last year, Kylie Cosmetics did an estimated $360 million in sales, according to Forbes. Jenner, who has a one-year-old daughter, owns 100 percent of the company. She also makes money from endorsements and appearances on cable TVÃ¢ÂÂs Keeping Up with the Kardashians and was ranked at number 2,057 on the Forbes 2019 list. Kylie Cosmetics last year signed a deal with Ulta Beauty to put her products in all of the retailerÃ¢ÂÂs 1,163 US stores. Forbes put 2,153 billionaires on its 2019 list, down from 2,208 in 2018, and said their total combined net worth was $8.7 trillion, down from $9.1 trillion in 2018.

London HIV patient becomes worldÃ¢ÂÂs second AIDS cure hope,"An HIV-positive man in Britain has become the second known adult worldwide to be cleared of the AIDS virus after he received a bone marrow transplant from an HIV resistant donor, his doctors said. Almost three years after receiving bone marrow stem cells from a donor with a rare genetic mutation that resists HIV infection Ã¢ÂÂ and more than 18 months after coming off antiretroviral drugs Ã¢ÂÂ highly sensitive tests still show no trace of the manÃ¢ÂÂs previous HIV infection. Ã¢ÂÂThere is no virus there that we can measure. We canÃ¢ÂÂt detect anything,Ã¢ÂÂ said Ravindra Gupta, a professor and HIV biologist who co-led a team of doctors treating the man. The case is a proof of the concept that scientists will one day be able to end AIDS, the doctors said, but does not mean a cure for HIV has been found. Gupta described his patient as Ã¢ÂÂfunctionally curedÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂin remissionÃ¢ÂÂ, but cautioned: Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs too early to say heÃ¢ÂÂs cured.Ã¢ÂÂ The man is being called Ã¢ÂÂthe London patientÃ¢ÂÂ, in part because his case is similar to the first known case of a functional cure of HIV Ã¢ÂÂ in an American man, Timothy Brown, who became known as the Berlin patient when he underwent similar treatment in Germany in 2007 which also cleared his HIV. Brown, who had been living in Berlin, has since moved to the United States and, according to HIV experts, is still HIV-free. Some 37 million people worldwide are currently infected with HIV and the AIDS pandemic has killed around 35 million people worldwide since it began in the 1980s. Scientific research into the complex virus has in recent years led to the development of drug combinations that can keep it at bay in most patients. Gupta, now at Cambridge University, treated the London patient when he was working at University College London. The man had contracted HIV in 2003, Gupta said, and in 2012 was also diagnosed with a type of blood cancer called HodgkinÃ¢ÂÂs Lymphoma. In 2016, when he was very sick with cancer, doctors decided to seek a transplant match for him. Ã¢ÂÂThis was really his last chance of survival,Ã¢ÂÂ Gupta told Reuters in an interview. The donor Ã¢ÂÂ who was unrelated Ã¢ÂÂ had a genetic mutation known as Ã¢ÂÂCCR5 delta 32Ã¢ÂÂ, which confers resistance to HIV. The transplant went relatively smoothly, Gupta said, but there were some side effects, including the patient suffering a period of Ã¢ÂÂgraft-versus-hostÃ¢ÂÂ disease Ã¢ÂÂ a condition in which donor immune cells attack the recipientÃ¢ÂÂs immune cells. Most experts say it is inconceivable such treatments could be a way of curing all patients. The procedure is expensive, complex and risky. To do this in others, exact match donors would have to be found in the tiny proportion of people Ã¢ÂÂ most of them of northern European descent Ã¢ÂÂ who have the CCR5 mutation that makes them resistant to the virus. Specialists said it is also not yet clear whether the CCR5 resistance is the only key Ã¢ÂÂ or whether the graft versus host disease may have been just as important. Both the Berlin and London patients had this complication, which may have played a role in the loss of HIV-infected cells, Gupta said. Sharon Lewin, an expert at AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs Doherty Institute and co-chair of the International AIDS SocietyÃ¢ÂÂs cure research advisory board, told Reuters the London case points to new avenues for study. Ã¢ÂÂWe havenÃ¢ÂÂt cured HIV, but (this) gives us hope that itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be feasible one day to eliminate the virus,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Gupta said his team plans to use these findings to explore potential new HIV treatment strategies. Ã¢ÂÂWe need to understand if we could knock out this (CCR5) receptor in people with HIV, which may be possible with gene therapy,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. The London patient, whose case was set to be reported in the journal Nature and presented at a medical conference in Seattle on Tuesday, has asked his medical team not to reveal his name, age, nationality or other details.

Abdul-JabbarÃÂ´s 14K 1987 diamond ring sold for the most at $398,937. His three MVP trophies (1976, 1974, 1972) all sold for more than $120,000 each. He won six total MVP awards. A signed ball from his final regular season game in 1989 went for $270,000. Abdul-Jabbar said Ã¢ÂÂmuchÃ¢ÂÂ of the proceeds would go to his foundation which helps educate children. Ã¢ÂÂLooking back on what I have done with my life, instead of gazing at the sparkle of jewels or gold plating celebrating something I did a long time ago, IÃÂ´d rather look into the delighted face of a child holding their first caterpillar and think about what I might be doing for their future,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

Robinson Crusoe island sets example for the world in conservation,"For almost a century, the inhabitants of Robinson Crusoe Ã¢ÂÂ named for literatureÃÂ´s most famous castaway Ã¢ÂÂ have known that their islandÃÂ´s fragile ecosystem depends on them conserving its unique wildlife. One of three islands in the Juan Fernandez archipelago, 700 kilometers (430 miles) off the Pacific coast of Chile, it was discovered in the sixteenth century. The island chain secured its place in history as the home of Alexander Selkirk, the Scottish sailor marooned there for four years and four months, a tale he later related to Daniel Defoe, who penned his adventure book based on his story. One of the other islands in the chain is called Alexander Selkirk, the third is Santa Clara. In 1977, the archipelago was named a biosphere reserve and almost a year ago, Chile announced the creation of the enormous Juan Fernandez Marine Park. Covering an area of 262,000 square kilometers (101,000 square miles) of ocean, it is one of the largest protected zones in the Pacific. It also connects to a network of marine reserves in Chile totalling some 1.3 million square kilometers, meaning that about 44 percent of the nationÃÂ´s waters have some level of protection against mining and industrial fishing. Ã¢ÂÂUntil 10 years ago, Chile was one of the biggest ocean exploiters in the world, but now it has changed course and become one of the leaders in ocean conservation, with the creation of huge marine parks which will really help fish stocks recover,Ã¢ÂÂ said Alex Munoz, Latin America director of the NGO National Geographic Pristine Seas. Ã¢ÂÂBut we are still a sick patient in need of recuperation,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. The wildlife of these remote islands faces various threats, including ocean trash Ã¢ÂÂ in particular plastic Ã¢ÂÂ and invasive species that have been introduced to the fragile ecosystem of Juan Fernandez, home to around 1,000 people. Cats, rats and coatis (a type of South American raccoon) are the main hazard for the Juan Fernandez firecrown, a type of hummingbird found only in the islands, and whose eggs and chicks are easy prey. They are also a threat to the pink-footed shearwater, a migratory seabird which only nests in the archipelago, where there are 35,000 pairs, and on Mocha Island, close to the mainland, where there are 60,000 breeding pairs. The environment ministry has just launched a recovery plan to protect the underground nests of the shearwaters, which fly in to mate every year from the United States and Canada. Ã¢ÂÂPeople are taking this seriously,Ã¢ÂÂ said Pablo Manriquez, coordinator for the NGO Oikonos, noting that residents have changed their street and house lights from white to red or green to help the shearwaters avoid crashing into buildings and trees in foggy weather, when the bright lights appear to disorient them. Downed birds are vulnerable to predators. Work has also been started to preserve the luma trees where hummingbirds nest, eradicating non-native blackberry bushes that strangle the trees. Sustainable fishing is the archipelagoÃÂ´s main goal. As far back as 1935, fishermen started introducing measures to preserve the islandsÃÂ´ principal source of income, the lobster, which is mainly sold to China where a live crustacean can bring in $200. Ã¢ÂÂThey brought down the catch by 75 percent!Ã¢ÂÂ said fisherman Wilson Gonzalez, whose family has been fishing here for generations. The result was the first sustainable fishery in South America, said Daniel Gonzalez, head of the islandsÃÂ´ fishing union. Fishing is only permitted from October 1 until May 15 and only then using wooden lobster pots. There are also limits on the size of lobsters that can be taken, and females with eggs are returned to the sea. There are other notable success stories: the South American fur seal, a species that was almost extinct 40 years ago, now has a population of 30,000 on the islands. Ã¢ÂÂThe great asset of Juan Fernandez is that the local population takes part in conserving species, together with the NGOs,Ã¢ÂÂ said Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt on a recent visit. A paradise for divers and hikers, the islands are opening up to tourism, though getting here is tricky Ã¢ÂÂ the small planes that fly in carry a maximum of eight passengers because they have to carry enough fuel for the return trip, which means tickets are expensive at $800 a head. Plastic that arrives on supply ships from the mainland every two weeks, or is washed up on ocean currents, is one of the islandsÃÂ´ main challenges. Unlike Easter Island, another far-flung Chilean outpost in the Pacific which ships some of its plastic back to the mainland for recycling, the archipelago burns all its waste, some 315 tons of it. Munoz, together with local authorities and the environment ministry, has just signed an agreement that will see the islands eradicate plastic by 2020. Ã¢ÂÂIf we want a zero waste world, we need to start with a world without plastic,Ã¢ÂÂ said Schmidt. AFP.

BalochistanÃ¢ÂÂs Sibi festival kicks off,"SIBI: The annual Sibi Festival kicked-off in Balochistan on Sunday. Chief Minister Balochistan formally inaugurates the week-long festival. Addressing the inaugural ceremony of historical Sibi festival in Sibi on Sunday, he said we are proud of the security forces for restoring peace in the province. The Chief Minister said the government would ensure provision of all basic amenities of life to the masses including health and educational facilities. The event started with a horse and cattle show, similar to the one hosted each year in Lahore, Punjab. People from all over Balochistan brought their cattle and horses to sell. Last year, over 2,000 Bhag Nari and Bal Nari Ã¢ÂÂ two cattle breeds found only in Sibi Ã¢ÂÂ were sold to farmers in Punjab and Sindh. Historiansbelieve that Sibi festival dates back thousands of years and the previous rulers celebrated it annually. Mir Chakar Khan Rind, who ruled over Balochistan in the 16th century, made Sibi his capital. He would hold the festival at the end of each winters and before the advent of spring. Provincial ministers, members of the national and provincial assembly, belonging to Balochistan will also attend the mela.
