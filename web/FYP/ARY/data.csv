Football association rocked by sexual abuse allegations,"
A scandal is brewing in Colombian football as allegations of discrimination and sexual abuse targeting teenage girls has shocked the nation.
Colombia’s own #MeToo movement is emerging following painful testimony from a former physiotherapist who worked with one of Colombia’s national age group teams.
Carolina Rozo, 38, disclosed she had fallen into depression after she was personally targeted by an alleged sexual predator, the coach of the women’s Under-17 team, Didier Luna.

 In addition she also alleged that girls on the team who she treated professionally had also been groomed by the same man.
Carolina Rozo, former physio of the Colombian under-17 women’s national football team, has told AFP of alleged abuse and intimidation at the hands of former coach Didier Luna
Sexism and abuse have been known to exist in Colombian football, but it took Rozo’s outspoken allegations to break the silence.
The disclosures come at a time when women’s football is experiencing a worldwide surge in popularity ahead of this year’s World Cup, to be played in France from June 7 to July 7.
The charges also shine a light on a post-#MeToo world in which Colombian women feel empowered to speak out against discrimination and sexual aggression.
“It’s a very important time,” said Colombian journalist Alejandro Pino, who has been documenting abuse cases.
“Now we have a generation of players, especially women, who are educated and are aware that they can demand that their right be respected.”
Rozo was appointed physiotherapist for the Colombian teenage squad in late 2017 as the team were preparing for that year’s women’s Under-17 World Cup in December and the South American championship the following year.
She survived just six months in the post and suffered a nightmare experience after refusing Luna’s alleged advances.
“He says to me ‘I just want you to give me a bit of your heart’, then that’s when I say ‘No, wait a moment… it’s not what I’m looking for, please respect that’,” she told AFP in an interview.
The rejection triggered an angry response and Luna warned her to “assume the consequences.”
She soon found out what he meant, saying that she suffered professional harassment and intimidation, eventually succumbing to depression.
Players of the Colombian women’s national football team train amid a brewing scandal over allegations of abuse and harassment
Not normal
Meanwhile girls on the team who were less able to stand up for themselves faced verbal aggression and touchings, she said.
“I noticed since the gathering in December (for 2017 World Cup preparations) the approach that he had with the girls, touching their backsides, approaching them, challenging them to kiss him, being rude to them, and then going out and touching their backside. This is not normal,” Rozo said.
She informed her superiors in the Colombian Football Federation but says it was not until her allegations began appearing in the media that Luna was dismissed.
Abuse allegations were not limited to one predator. The father of one of the team members has recounted the girl’s experiences at the hands of another team official, conditioning coach Sigifredo Alonso.
“She told me that he … entered her room and tried to interfere with her,” Jhon Cano told a local radio station.
He said he had complained to the federation, “but they never got back to me”.
However Alonso has since been dismissed and investigators are probing the allegations.
Colombians have also been shocked by allegations from two players on the women’s senior international team, Isabella Echeverri and Melissa Ortiz, of financial discrimination.
They says former coach Felipe Taborda demanded money for picking them for the team and they even had to pay for their own uniforms when playing for their country.
Seventeen players signed a statement denouncing discrimination compared to the men’s team, saying they were even forced to pay their own medical bills.
Men are also speaking out. Two former referees, Harold Perilla and Carlos Chavez, recently accused Oscar Julian Ruiz, one of South America’s most powerful match officials, of harassment and abuse.
Contacted by AFP, Ruiz, a referee at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cups and now a coach at the South American football confederation, said he had been advised by his lawyers not to comment on the allegations.

New Zealand votes to amend gun laws after Christchurch attack,"
WELLINGTON: Lawmakers in New Zealand voted almost unanimously on Wednesday to change gun laws, less than a month after its worst peacetime mass shooting, in which 50 people were killed in attacks on two mosques in Christchurch.
Parliament passed the gun reform bill, the first substantial changes to New Zealand’s gun laws in decades, by 119 to 1. It must now receive royal assent from the governor general to become law.
“There have been very few occasions when I have seen parliament come together in this way, and I can’t imagine circumstances when it is more necessary,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in presenting the legislation.

 Ardern banned the sale of all military style semi-automatics (MSSA) and assault rifles just six days after the March 15 shooting, and announced plans to tighten gun laws.
A lone gunman used semi-automatic guns in the Christchurch mosque attacks, killing 50 people as they attended Friday prayers.

Authorities have charged Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a suspected white supremacist, with 50 counts of murder following the attacks.
The new curbs bar the circulation and use of most semi-automatic firearms, parts that convert firearms into semi-automatic firearms, magazines over a certain capacity, and some shotguns.
Existing gun laws had provided for a standard A-category gun license covering semi-automatics limited to seven shots.
The bill grants an amnesty until Sept. 30 for people to surrender prohibited items. More than 300 weapons had already been handed in, police minister Stuart Nash told parliament.
The government has begun work on a second arms amendment bill it hopes to introduce in June, he said, adding that the measure would tackle issues regarding a gun registry, among others.
The government has faced criticism from some quarters for rushing through the bill. Wednesday’s dissenting vote came from David Seymour, leader of the small free-market ACT Party, who questioned why the measure was being rushed through.
Ardern said majority lawmakers believe such guns had no place in New Zealand.
“We are ultimately here because 50 people died and they do not have a voice,” she added. “We, in this house, are their voice and today we have used that voice wisely.”
Since last month’s shooting, New Zealand has tightened security and cancelled several events in Auckland, its largest city, intended to commemorate ANZAC Day on April 25.
“There is no information about a specific threat to ANZAC events,” police official Karyn Malthus, said in a statement. “However it’s important that the public be safe, and feel safe, at events in the current environment.”
In 1996, neighbouring Australia banned semi-automatic weapons and launched a gun buyback after the Port Arthur massacre that killed 35 people.

Setback for Modi as Indian SC to review ‘secret’ Rafale deal documents,"
NEW DELHI: The Indian Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday ruled out to review the ‘secret’ Rafale deal documents after rejecting government’s claim of privilege on the newly published Rafale papers.
“We deem it proper to dismiss the Union’s plea,” a three-judge bench led by CJI Ranjan Gogoi said. The court will fix a date for the review hearing later.
The government had alleged that these documents widely published in the media had been purloined or stolen and hence were not to be admitted as evidence in the court proceedings.

 The petitioners, who sought a review of the court’s clean chit on the ground of errors of fact, urged the court to examine these documents during the review hearing.

Canada’s golden boy Trudeau sinks in polls as scandal takes toll,"
OTTAWA: When Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office in late 2015, he was a political golden boy who seemed destined to build on the legend of his father, who led the country for more than 15 years.
But six months ahead of an October election, polls suggest the 47-year-old politician with the broad smile and a penchant for colourful socks could become the first prime minister to lose power after a single majority mandate since the 1930s.
Trudeau is mired in a relentless scandal over alleged interference in a corporate corruption case that has led to the resignations of two Cabinet members, his top advisor, and the head of the federal civil service.

 The ruling Liberals have lost six percentage points since the start of the year, ceding the lead to the rival Conservatives, according to a Nanos Research poll published on Tuesday.
If an election were held now, the Conservatives would win 34.9 percent of the vote, the Liberals 32.8 percent and the left-leaning New Democratic Party 16.6 percent. The poll suggests the result would be deadlock or a fragile minority government.
“The Liberals have taken a hit, but they’re still competitive,” said pollster Nik Nanos. “The most significant effect has been the negative impact on the prime minister’s personal brand.”
An Ipsos poll from last month put the Conservatives at 40 percent, 10 points ahead of the Liberals.
Trudeau, the oldest son of the late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, has from the start pushed a progressive agenda in support of gender equality, the environment and aboriginal rights, all issues that appeal to his core voters, but which after more than three years sound increasingly scripted to some.
Trudeau is not helped by the optics of the scandal involving SNC-Lavalin Group Inc, a prominent Montreal-based engineering and construction firm that has been accused of bribing Libyan officials to get contracts between 2001 and 2011.
The prime minister has been on the defensive over allegations government officials inappropriately pressured Canada’s former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to drop a criminal case against the company in favour of a deferred prosecution agreement, or out-of-court settlement.
Wilson-Raybould, the first indigenous justice minister in Canadian history, resigned over the scandal. Former Treasury Board chief Jane Philpott also quit in protest. They were two of the highest-profile women in Trudeau’s Cabinet.
Political pivot
So far, Trudeau’s strategy appears to have changed little, and people close to him say he plans toride it out without major shifts in strategy.
“Successful politicians know when to pivot, and they have a strong survival instinct,” Nanos said, calling the scandal the “first major test of Justin Trudeau’s leadership”.
Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker said even before the crisis erupted in early February, Trudeau’s support had been softening amid complaints he had broken major commitments such as reforming the voting system and balancing the budget by 2019.
“Justin Trudeau was standing on thin ice at the end of last year, and then somebody handed him an anvil and crash, the ice broke,” Bricker said.
“There’s a credibility problem driven by a bunch of things, one of which is promises made and not kept.”
In a bid to finally put the scandal behind him, Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus last week.
Neither minister has gone quietly, and, on Tuesday, Philpott disputed the legitimacy of the expulsions.
On Sunday, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer revealed that Trudeau had threatened to sue him for libel over a Facebook post about the scandal.

"Trump praises Egypt’s Sisi despite concerns about human rights, Russian arms","
WASHINGTON: U.S. President Donald Trump praised his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as a “great president” on Tuesday despite U.S. lawmakers’ concerns about his record on human rights, efforts to keep him in office until 2034 and planned Russian arms purchases.
U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 9, 2019. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque
Egypt’s parliament has proposed constitutional reforms aimed at allowing Sisi to remain in power until 2034, a move criticized by senior U.S. lawmakers and advocacy groups who are also disturbed by Egypt’s repression of human rights.

 Asked if he backed the efforts to allow Sisi to potentially stay in power for another 15 years, Trump told reporters: “I think he’s doing a great job. I don’t know about the effort, I can just tell you he is doing a great job … great president.”
Sisi is a former general who came to power after the military overthrew President Mohammed Mursi in 2013 following mass protests against his rule. Sisi was elected president the following year.
Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous nation, is of strategic importance to the United States because of its peace treaty with Israel and its control of the Suez Canal, a vital waterway for global commerce as well as the U.S. military.
The U.S. Congress has appropriated $1.4 billion in bilateral assistance for Egypt in the current fiscal year, the same amount provided the previous year, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service.
While there continues to be support for aid to Egypt, members of Congress have voiced deep concerns about its reported signing of a $2 billion deal with Russia to buy more than 20 Sukhoi SU-35 fighter jets and weapons for the aircraft.
In a letter released on Monday, leading senators also said Egypt had “unjustly detained more than a dozen Americans,” called for their release, and raised “serious concerns about the erosion of political and human rights.”
The letter to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was signed by the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s Republican chairman Jim Risch, the panel’s senior Democrat Sen. Bob Menendez as well as 15 other senators.
“We are concerned (about) their deepening relationship with Russia, which also includes the loan that Moscow has provided to construct the nuclear power plant at Dabaa,” it said, referring to a 4,800 megawatt plant aimed to be in service by 2026.
The senators asked Pompeo to request that Sisi “reevaluate these decisions, which risk making his country a Russian dependency once again.”
Egypt and the Soviet Union were close allies until the 1970s, when Cairo moved closer to the United States, which brokered its 1979 peace deal with Israel.
Trump did not directly address the issue of Egypt’s planned Russian arms purchase. He said “a lot of progress has been made … in terms of terrorism and other things with Egypt.”
“We’ve never had a better relationship, Egypt and the United States, than we do right now,” Trump added as the two men spoke to reporters before meeting in the White House Oval Office.
“All the credit goes to you, Mister President,” Sisi responded through an interpret. “Thank you very much for your support on all fronts.”

WASHINGTON: The leaders of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees warned Turkey on Tuesday that it risked tough sanctions if it pursued plans to purchase Russian S-400 missile defense systems, and they threatened further legislative action.
“By the end of the year, Turkey will have either F-35 advanced fighter aircraft on its soil or a Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile defense system. It will not have both,” Republican Senators Jim Risch and Jim Inhofe and Democratic Senators Bob Menendez and Jack Reed said in a New York Times opinion column.
Risch is chairman of Foreign Relations and Menendez is ranking Democrat. Inhofe chairs Armed Services, where Reed is ranking Democrat.

As committee leaders, the senators have powers such as placing “holds” on major foreign weapons sales and major roles in writing legislation, which could include punishing Turkey if it goes ahead with the S-400 deal.
The senators said Turkey would be sanctioned, as required under U.S. law, if it goes ahead with the S-400 purchase.
“Sanctions will hit Turkey’s economy hard – rattling international markets, scaring away foreign direct investment and crippling Turkey’s aerospace and defense industry,” they said.
The United States and fellow NATO member Turkey have been at loggerheads over Ankara’s decision to purchase the S-400s, which are not compatible with NATO systems. Washington also says Turkey’s purchase of the S-400s would compromise the security of F-35 fighter jets, which are built by Lockheed Martin Corp and use stealth technology.

"Zimbabwe seeks $613 million aid from donors after drought, cyclone","
HARARE: Zimbabwe appealed on Tuesday for $613 million in aid from local and foreign donors to cover food imports and help with a humanitarian crisis after a severe drought and a cyclone that battered the east of the country.
An El Nino-induced drought has wilted crops across Zimbabwe and left about a third of its 15 million people in need of food assistance, according to a U.N. agency.
The situation was worsened when Zimbabwe, along with Mozambique and Malawi, were last month battered by Cyclone Idai, leaving hundreds of thousands needing food, water and shelter.

 An appeal document given to reporters by the ministry of information showed the government is seeking about $300 million in aid for food while the rest would fund emergency shelters, logistics and telecommunications among other needs.

Hundreds of people have died in Mozambique and Malawi and the death toll in Zimbabwe was now 344.
Meanwhile, Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said the cabinet had hiked the maize price paid to farmers by 86 percent to $232 a tonne and maintained a subsidy for millers in a bid to keep the price of the staple maize meal down.
In February, Zimbabwe scrapped a 1:1 peg between the U.S. dollar and the bond notes and electronic dollars it introduced to compensate for its hard currency shortage, merging the surrogate currencies into the RTGS dollar.
Mutsvangwa said farmers would be paid 726 RTGS dollars ($232), up from 390 RTGS dollars.
The RTGS dollar was trading at 3.12 to the U.S. dollar on Tuesday on the bank market and at 4.4 on the black market.
The government is the sole buyer and seller of maize in Zimbabwe through the state-owned Grain Marketing Board.

"India’s rice, buffalo meat exports drop","
MUMBAI: India’s rice exports for April-February dropped 9.4 percent from a year earlier to 10.57 million tonnes, as leading buyer Bangladesh trimmed its purchases due to a bumper local harvest, a government body said in a statement on Wednesday.
The country’s buffalo meat exports during the period dropped 9.6 percent from a year ago to 1.12 million tonnes, the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority said, as demand moderated from the biggest buyer – China.
Guar gum exports climbed 3.5 percent to 465,705 tonnes on robust demand from the United States.

 India is the world’s biggest exporter of buffalo meat, guar gum and rice.
The country’s exports of pulses nearly doubled during the period to 261,016 tonnes, while dairy exports surged 75.7 percent to 152,736 tonnes due to government incentives for exports of skimmed milk powder, the agency said.
India will hold a general election starting on Thursday in the world’s largest democratic exercise, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a second straight term.
The election will held in seven phases until May 19 and votes will be counted on May 23.
Modi government’s inability to create a million jobs every month, and ease farmers’ distress over low product prices, has taken the shine off what is still the world’s fastest growing major economy.
From sugar farmers in Uttar Pradesh going unpaid for produce, to small businesses in the south shut because they are unable to meet the requirements of a new, unifying national tax, discontent has brewed for months.

"Offshore drilling at Kekra-I project achieves major success, claim sources","
KARACHI: The Eni led drilling for exploration of oil and gas reserves in Pakistani waters have achieved a major success, sources in the know of the matter claimed.
The ARY News quoting the sources reported that the offshore drilling of Kekra-I project has made key progress and the work has entered in its final phase.
The drilling work has reached to 5000 meters depth and nearing end to its target of 5800 meters, sources said.

 Preparations being made to forward a report to the prime minister, sources further said.
Recently international energy research agency Rystad Energy in a report said that the Eni’s Kekra project for oil and gas reserves in Pakistani waters is among three highly prospective wells in the world.
The research agency in its report on the prospective new discoveries of energy resources said that Kekra well in Pakistan have pre-drill prospective resource estimates of 1.5 billion barrels of oil or equivalent.
A group of multinational companies had started offshore drilling in January at a distance of 230 kilometers from Karachi for exploration of oil and gas.
A major drilling ship, “Mother of All Rigs” along with three supply vessels started the drilling at the site.
The companies are drilling Kekra-1 well in Indus-G block, which is located some 280 kilometres away from the Karachi coast.
They would drill around 5,800 meters deep from the sea level and are targeting to complete the spud in the next 60 days, sources earlier said.
Eni Pakistan is the operator of the block, while, Exploration and Production Pakistan BV (EEPP) is drilling the well. Besides, Pakistan’s state-owned Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDC) and Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) are part of the joint venture. Each of the four firms have a 25% participating interest in the block, officials said.

No legal basis to ban e-cigarette imports: India’s trade ministry,"
NEW DELHI: India’s trade ministry says it cannot impose a ban on electronic cigarette imports as there is no legal basis for doing so, an internal government memo viewed by Reuters shows, in a boost for those looking to tap into the country’s growing vaping market.
This comes amid repeated calls for a ban from the country’s health ministry, which urged states and government agencies last year in an “advisory” to step up efforts to halt sales and imports, warning vaping devices pose a “great health risk”.
The country has 106 million adult smokers, second only to China, making it a lucrative market for firms such U.S.-based Juul Labs and Philip Morris International that plan to launch e-smoking devices in the country.

 India’s Jubilant group, one of whose units has the franchisee for Domino’s Pizza and Dunkin’ Donuts outlets in the country, is already exploring importing Juul’s vaping device, a company letter shows.
Halting imports of e-cigarettes into India will be against multilateral commitments with the World Trade Organization, according to the internal government memo dated March 18.
The country must first prohibit local sales through federal regulations that “can stand the scrutiny of law”, the memo adds.
Once that is done, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) can announce an “import ban”, the memo said.
As of now, the health ministry’s “advisory” cannot be a legal basis for a ban, the trade ministry, which has the power to impose import bans, said in the memo that is not yet public.
The DGFT did not respond to a request for comment.
A health ministry official said the ministry will work with the DGFT to explore how a ban can be imposed.
JUBILANT &amp; JUUL
India’s $12 billion cigarette market is dominated by companies such as ITC and Godfrey Phillips, both of which also sell e-cigarettes.
Its vapor-products market was valued at $15.6 million in 2017 and is seen growing nearly 60 percent annually in the next few years, Euromonitor International estimates.
Keen to tap into this growth, Juul has hired new executives in India and plans to launch its products in the country by late 2019, Reuters has previously reported.
But India’s health ministry has called to block Juul’s entry, saying its product was “harmful” and could undermine India’s tobacco-control efforts.
A Jubilant unit, however, said in a letter to the health ministry dated Jan. 11, that it had identified Juul as a “highly safe” product which has “benefited millions of consumers”.
Jubilant Offshore said in the letter it was in “advanced stages” of importing and selling e-cigarettes in the country.
A Jubilant spokesman said “we believe there is demonstrable scientific evidence” that such products are a viable alternative to cigarettes and that the group is “exploring the category”.
Juul said it was in the process of evaluating India by having conversations with stakeholders.
The benefits of e-cigarettes, most of which vaporize a liquid containing nicotine, have been a topic for much debate in the global public health community.
Some say it helps shift smokers to less harmful products, but others argue it could create a new generation of addicts.
As of 2016, e-cigarettes were banned in 30 of World Health Organization’s 195 member states. In India, about a third of its 29 states currently ban e-cigarette sales.
The country, home to the world’s second-largest population at 1.3 billion, has tough laws to deter tobacco use, which the government says kills more than 900,000 people annually.

Pakistan about to become tourism’s next big thing: Telegraph,"
Pakistan is about to become tourism’s next big thing,The Telegraphreported.
According to the newspaper, the country was once one of the highlights of the classic “hippie trail” or “overland” route from Europe to the Far East for disillusioned Western youth. Peshawar and Lahore were considered not only safe — but also fine places to kick back for a few days in an economical hostel.
The incumbent government has taken several steps to give a boost to tourism industry in Pakistan. Recently,Prime Minister Imran Khan has inaugurated Pakistan’s online visa regime for foreign nationals of 190 countries along withvisa-on-arrival facility for 55 states.

 As per the new visa policy, e-visa facility will initially be provided to five countries namely Turkey, China, Malaysia, United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The citizens of these countries will be able to apply for Pakistani visa via email at a $8 fee.
Jane Westwood, who runs Wild Frontiers, one of the few UK operators to offer tours of Pakistan, welcomed the efforts of Pakistan in tourism industry.
“The old visa system was very convoluted,” she said. “Both travellers and tour operators needed to file numerous supporting documents and the whole process took two weeks or more — now it can be wrapped up in a matter of hours. It is also significantly cheaper, from £134 down to the equivalent of $60 [£46].”
Westwood also lauded the new No Objection Certificate (NOC) system, under which travelers do not need special permission to visit certain parts of Pakistan except a few border regions. The move has opened up parts of Kashmir, Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan.
“It’s a beautiful country, and one of the most welcoming,” said Westwood. “The mountain scenery is staggering and it’s perfect for trekking, but there are fascinating cities too. Islamabad is leafy and green, with wide boulevards; Lahore has a remarkable Old City, gardens, museums and forts— a real combination of old and new. Then there’s the Kalasha Valleys, which have a unique pagan culture, with traditional lifestyles, dress and festivals.”
She noted that bookings for Pakistan tours have increased considerably during the past two or three years, official tourism statistics prove it too.
In 2015, Pakistan welcomed 563,000 overseas arrivals. That figure grew to 965,000 in 2016, 1.6m in 2017 and 1.9m last year, the numbers leaves no doubts that Pakistan is thetourism’s next big thing.

Pakistan economy grow by 2.5% till Year 2024: IMF says in its outlook,"
ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said Pakistan’s economy will grow at an average rate of just 2.5% till Year 2024 if the reforms proposed by it will not implemented, ARY News reported on Wednesday.
“In Pakistan, in the absence of further adjustment policies, growth is projected to remain subdued at about 2.5 percent, with continued external and fiscal imbalances weighing on confidence”, the IMF said in its economic outlook.
The IMF officials said that the lender was in talks with Pakistan for a three-year bailout package.

 A delegation of Pakistan’s economic officials led by Finance Minister Asad Umar, has been in Washington to attend the IMF session, which will continue until April 14.
In its flagship World Economic Outlook, the IMF projects mid-term growth prospects for Pakistan to remain subdued at 2.5 percent by 2024. The next year growth rate forecast by the fund was in line with 2.7 percent growth rate projected by the World Bank earlier. The IMF has forecast 2.9 percent growth rate for the current fiscal year in comparison to the World Bank’s 3.6 percent.
According to the IMF outlook the economy of Pakistan will grow by 2.8 percent in the next fiscal year.
The fund attributed negative outlook to fuel prices and macroeconomic challenges and the impact of the slowdown in global economy.
The fund projected consumer price index in Pakistan at 7.6 percent during the current fiscal year, slowing down to seven percent next fiscal year and then stabilising to five percent by 2024.
The fund has estimated Pakistan’s current account deficit at 5.2 percent of the GDP during the current year going down to 4.3 percent next year before surging again to 5.4 percent by 2024.
The unemployment rate projected to stay at 6.1 percent during the current year, 6.2 percent next year and remain in the same level by 2024.
The IMF in its medium-term outlook for the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan notes that the region was largely shaped by the outlook for fuel prices, needed adjustment to correct macroeconomic imbalances in certain economies and geopolitical tensions.

"FBR says, unearthed six Benami Accounts with over eight bln transactions","
KARACHI: The Federal Board of Revenue has claimed major success during its anti-money laundering campaign by tracing six benami accounts with over eight billion rupees transactions, ARY News reported on Wednesday.
The Directorate General of Intelligence and Investigation Inland Revenue has registered a case against four traders of the city, officials said.
The four traders accused of around Rs. 1.26 billion tax theft within a span of five years, FBR officials said.

 The case has been registered against Zor Talib Khan, Ammar Khan, Mohammad Hassan and Mohammad Hamza, who have been registered with addresses of Karachi’s Saddar mobile market and district Buner in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The tax authorities have issued the Rs. two million bailable warrants of the each accused, officials said.
According to the FBR accused trader Zor Talib Khan is proprietor of M/s Salar Enterprises and Salar Mining. He had opened six benami accounts during year 2012 to 2017, the officials said.

"Social media a popular, yet not trusted, news source: poll","
About half of Americans and Canadians get their news primarily from social media, yet most don’t trust this source of information, according to a survey released Tuesday.
According to the Maru/Matchbox poll, 52 percent of Americans and 48 percent of Canadians said they find out what’s happening in the world through social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
Only television (64 percent) and news websites (49 percent) in the United States ranked higher as sources of news.

 But while trust in traditional news services including radio and newspapers rated above 80 percent in both countries, trust in social media was lowest among all sources at 43 percent in the United States and 32 percent in Canada.
Political news is the most likely to contain misinformation, according to respondents.
That was a significant concern for Americans (84 percent) worried about “fake news” in the upcoming 2020 US presidential election. But half were confident they could easily spot false or inaccurate information.
“Social media is changing our relationship with the news,” said Sara Cappe of Maru/Matchbox.
“While it has become a common source of news and news-related information, people are less trusting of what they find there. The upside is that many feel more engaged with the news than ever before.”
The pollster interviewed 1,516 Canadians and 1,523 Americans for the survey commissioned by the Canadian Journalism Foundation, with a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points.

Here is the first ever image of a black hole,"
Scientists have obtained the first image of a black hole, using Event Horizon Telescope observations of the center of the galaxy M87.
The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) — a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration — was designed to capture images of a black hole.
Today, in coordinated press conferences across the globe, EHT researchers reveal that they have succeeded, unveiling the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow.

 The image reveals the black hole at the center of Messier 87, a massive galaxy in the nearby Virgo galaxy cluster. This black hole resides 55 million light-years from Earth and has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the Sun.
This breakthrough was announced today in a series of six papers published in a special issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters.
The image reveals the black hole at the center of Messier 87, a massive galaxy in the nearby Virgo galaxy cluster. This black hole resides 55 million light-years from Earth and has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the Sun.
“We have taken the first picture of a black hole,” said EHT project director Sheperd S. Doeleman of the Center for Astrophysics.
“This is an extraordinary scientific feat accomplished by a team of more than 200 researchers.”
Black holes are extraordinary cosmic objects with enormous masses but extremely compact sizes. The presence of these objects affects their environment in extreme ways, warping spacetime and super-heating any surrounding material.

“If immersed in a bright region, like a disc of glowing gas, we expect a black hole to create a dark region similar to a shadow — something predicted by Einstein’s general relativity that we’ve never seen before, explained chair of the EHT Science Council Heino Falcke of Radboud University, the Netherlands. “This shadow, caused by the gravitational bending and capture of light by the event horizon, reveals a lot about the nature of these fascinating objects and allowed us to measure the enormous mass of M87’s black hole.”
Multiple calibration and imaging methods have revealed a ring-like structure with a dark central region — the black hole’s shadow — that persisted over multiple independent EHT observations.
“Once we were sure we had imaged the shadow, we could compare our observations to extensive computer models that include the physics of warped space, superheated matter and strong magnetic fields. Many of the features of the observed image match our theoretical understanding surprisingly well,” remarks Paul T.P. Ho, EHT Board member and Director of the East Asian Observatory.
“This makes us confident about the interpretation of our observations, including our estimation of the black hole’s mass.”
The EHT links telescopes around the globe to form an Earth-sized virtual telescope with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution.
The EHT is the result of years of international collaboration, and offers scientists a new way to study the most extreme objects in the Universe predicted by Einstein’s general relativity during the centennial year of the historic experiment that first confirmed the theory.

Thai cave boy divers explore new tunnel in Vietnam,"
BANGKOK: Three divers who helped rescue a Thai football team last year have made a fresh discovery in Vietnam where they explored a tunnel that could expand the footprint of the world’s largest cave.
The team was invited to descend into a waterlogged pit in the Son Doong cave in central Vietnam that has never been explored and is believed to connect to nearby chambers.
They were forced back at 77 meters (252 feet) because they did not have enough oxygen to push further, but they think the tunnels could be 120 meters deep.

 If the tunnel connects to another cave, it would make Son Doong “easily the largest cave in the world and it would never be overtaken,” British cave expert Howard Limbert, who helped organise the dive, said Tuesday at a press conference announcing the find.
The three divers — Rick Stanton, Jason Mallinson and Chris Jewell — were part of the daring rescue to save 12 Thai footballers and their coach who were trapped in a cave for eighteen days last year.
Stanton — who found the boys on a ledge — said the painstaking task of safely leading the group out of the tunnel alive helped to prepare for the mission in Vietnam.
“Our planning and preparation is without parallel,” he said.

The team plans to return to Vietnam next year to try to link the tunnel to another cave near Son Doong, which is so big that it has its own ecosystem and weather patterns.
The cave in central Quang Binh province was first found by a local forager in 1991, but was not re-discovered for another 19 years because its entrance was hidden by thick surrounding jungle.
Only 30 percent of Vietnam’s Phong Nha national park — where Son Doong and a network of adjacent caves are located — has so far been explored.
Son Doong is the world’s largest cave by volume, big enough to house a New York city block — including 40-storey skyscrapers — according to Oxalis, which runs tours into the caves.
Proposed plans to build a cable car in the area have sparked anger among the Vietnamese public who fear it will harm the area’s wildlife and pristine views.
An official said Tuesday there were no plans to move ahead with the project despite offers from several companies.
“That is only in theory, in truth, to build a cable car there is no such project yet,” the vice chairman of Quang Binh province Tran Thien Dung said Tuesday.
Vietnam’s tourism industry is booming among domestic and foreign travellers alike, but the communist country has come under fire for failing to preserve landscapes as it rapidly expands the sector.

Yahoo strikes $117.5 million data breach settlement,"
SAN FRANCISCO: Yahoo has struck a revised $117.5 million settlement with millions of people whose email addresses and other personal information were stolen in the largest data breach in history.
The proposed class-action settlement made public on Tuesday was designed to address criticisms of U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California. She rejected an earlier version of the accord on Jan. 28, and her approval is still required.
Koh said the original settlement was not “fundamentally fair, adequate and reasonable” because it had no overall dollar value and did not say how much victims might expect to recover. She also said the legal fees appeared to be too high.

 Yahoo, now part of New York-based Verizon Communications Inc, had been accused of being slow to disclose three data breaches affecting about 3 billion accounts from 2013 to 2016.
The new settlement includes at least $55 million for victims’ out-of-pocket expenses and other costs, $24 million for two years of credit monitoring, up to $30 million for legal fees, and up to $8.5 million for other expenses.
It covers as many as 194 million people in the United States and Israel with roughly 896 million accounts.
John Yanchunis, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in a court filing called the $117.5 million the “biggest common fund ever obtained in a data breach case.” He did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment.
Separately, Verizon agreed to spend $306 million between 2019 and 2022 on information security, five times what Yahoo spent from 2013 to 2016. It also pledged to quadruple Yahoo’s staffing in that area.
“The settlement demonstrates our strong commitment to security,” Verizon said in a statement.
Yahoo agreed in July 2016 to sell its internet business to Verizon for $4.83 billion. Only later did it reveal the scope of the breaches, prompting a price cut to $4.48 billion. Verizon wrote off much of Yahoo’s value in December.
U.S. prosecutors charged two Russian intelligence agents and two hackers in connection with one of the breaches in 2017. One hacker later pleaded guilty.
The case is In re: Yahoo Inc Customer Data Security Breach Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 16-md-02752.

Astronomers are poised Wednesday to unveil the first direct image of a black hole and the surrounding whirlwind of white-hot gas and plasma inexorably drawn by gravity into its ravenous maw, along with the light they generate.
The picture will have been captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a network of eight radio telescopes scattered across the globe.
Paul McNamara, an astrophysicist at the European Space Agency and project scientist for the LISA mission that will track massive black hole mergers from space, helped AFP put what he called an “outstanding technical achievement” into context.

 How do we know black holes exist?
“We think, of course, of a black hole as something very dark. But the mass it sucks in forms a so-called accretion disk that gets so hot it glows and emits light.
Over the years, we accumulated other indirect observational evidence -– X-rays coming off objects, for example, in other galaxies.
In September 2015, the LIGO gravitational wave detectors in the US made a measurement of two black holes smashing together.
All the evidence we have from around the universe -– X-rays, radio-waves, light -– points to these very compact objects, and the gravitational waves confirmed that they really are black holes, even if we have never actually seen one.”
What is an ‘event horizon’?
“At the centre of a black hole is something we call a ‘singularity’ -– a huge amount of mass shrunk down to an infinitely small, zero-dimensional point in space.
If you get a certain distance away from that singularity, the escape velocity drops under the speed of light. That’s the event horizon.
It is not a physical barrier -– you couldn’t stand on it. If you’re on the inside of it, you can’t escape because you would need infinite energy. If you are on the other side, you could escape — in principle.”
How big is a black hole?
“The diameter of a black hole depends on its mass but it is always double what we call the Schwarzschild radius.
If the Sun were to shrink to a singularity point, the Schwarzschild radius would be three kilometres, and the diameter would be six.
For Earth, the diameter would be 18 millimetres, or about three-quarters of an inch. The event horizon of the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*, measures about 24 million kilometres across.
Sagittarius A* — which has four million times the mass of the Sun — is one of two black holes targeted by the EHT. The other, even bigger, is in the galaxy M87.”
What will the image look like?
“The Event Horizon Telescope is not looking at the black hole per se, but the material it has captured.
It won’t be a big disk in high resolution like in the Hollywood movie ‘Interstellar’. But we might see a black core with a bright ring — the accretion disk — around it.
The light from behind the black hole gets bent like a lens. No matter what the orientation of the disc, you will see it as a ring because of the black hole’s strong gravity.
Visually, it will look very much like an eclipse, though the mechanism, of course, is completely different.”
How is the image generated?
“The technical achievement is outstanding. Rather than having one telescope that is 100 metres across, they have lots of telescopes with an effective diameter of 12,000 kilometres — the diameter of Earth.
The data is recorded with very high accuracy, put onto hard disks, and shipped to a central location where the image is reconstructed digitally.
This is very, very, very long baseline interferometry -– over the entire surface of the Earth.”
Any threat to general relativity?
“Einstein’s theory of general relativity fits all the observations made so far related to black holes.
The gravitational wave signature from the LIGO experiments, for example, was exactly what the theory says would be expected.
But the black holes LIGO measured were small, only 60-100 times the mass of the Sun. Maybe black holes millions of times more massive are different. We don’t know yet.
We should see a ring. If we see something elongated on one axis, then it can no longer be a singularity — that could be a violation of general relativity.”

Facebook says has made headway against abuses,"
MENLO PARK: Facebook has said it has made strides in its efforts to prevent online abuses in the Indian national election that starts this week but acknowledged that gaps remain in its “election integrity” efforts.
During a media tour of the company’s election operations center at its Menlo Park headquarters in California on Friday, company officials touted new fact-checking efforts for suppressing misinformation and technological advances such as the ability to detect when videos had been doctored.
But Katie Harbath, Facebook’s public policy director for global elections, said measures including a better system for verifying the buyers of political advertisements remained imperfect and called for more government regulation of ad-spending disclosures.

 Excoriated for failing to stop Russian manipulation in the 2016 U.S. presidential vote, Facebook has ramped up efforts to prevent abuses in subsequent elections, including the 2018 American midterms and the recent Brazilian and Mexican contests. Governments in many countries, including India and the UK, are contemplating strict new regulations for social media companies.
India, where Facebook has more users than in any other country, is shaping up as a major test. On April 1, the company said it had removed more than 500 accounts and 138 pages linked to India’s opposition Congress party for “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” Facebook’s term for the use of fake accounts and other deceptive methods to promote a message.
It also took down a page with 2 million followers which, according to Facebook’s review partner Atlantic Council think tank, was “pro-BJP” (India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party) and a supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Harbath said the company can now quickly detect viral, politically sensitive stories and refer them for fact-checking by outside organizations. The officials also touted heavy investment in technology for detecting doctored videos and text inside pictures, but acknowledged that that they have been unable to stop some duplicates of videos that have been identified as spurious.
Facebook has partnered with seven fact-checkers in India. If a post is found to be untrue, the company says it reduces the circulation of such fake posts by more than 80 percent, but slightly modified versions of the same images, video or text can escape detection and spread further.
Reuters earlier this month found instances of edited posts circulating on Facebook which the company’s own fact-checkers had said were false.
Deceptive political advertising has become another hot-button problem for the company. Facebook has toughened the rules in India and political ads now include “published by” and “paid by” disclaimers. Users can also access a library that allows them to search and find out more about political advertisements.
Harbath said political ad purchases in India now require either a certificate from the Election Commission or a physical address in India, as well as a phone number and group name of the entity purchasing the ad.
While Facebook will check that the address and phone number are legitimate, the company agreed that the same person could make up multiple entities at the same address, without any available record of the original source of money.
“This is a great example, we think, of where there needs to be more regulation,” Harbath said.

The NA body was apprised that 114 persons were currently performing duties at FIA cybercrime cell, whereas, the appointment of 400 more persons in the cell would be finalised in the near future.
The session was also attended by officials of Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA). They said that the Facebook administration’s response to complaints was good instead of Twitter.
On February 15, The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had announced to launch a crackdown on social media users propagating false information
According to FIA officials, the action will be carried out against people using fake accounts to spread false information. They said complaints were also received regarding the hacking of accounts of government officials.
The freedom of expression will not be targeted, but no one will be allowed to blackmail anyone under this pretext.

China’s virtual reality arcades aim for real-world success,"
SHANGHAI: Chen Jiuxiao puts on virtual-reality goggles and is immediately transported to a snow-covered ski slope, down which she slaloms without ever leaving Shanghai.
“I felt weightless skiing down the mountain,” Chen, 25, gushes after re-emerging in the material world.
“The scenery around me was so authentic,” she adds.

 Chen, a hospitality worker, said she ventured into one of Shanghai’s VR arcades due to word of mouth from her tech-savvy friends.
China had an estimated 3,000 VR arcades in 2016, and the market was forecast to grow 13-fold between then and 2021 to amount to 5.25 billion yuan ($782 million), according to a joint report by iResearch Consulting Group and Greenlight Insights.
Add in the profits to be made from headsets, equipment, games and other products, and it’s little wonder that augmented-reality and virtual-reality industries are excited about China.
“Chinese growth in the next five years could see it dominate AR/VR long-term — and not by a small margin,” Silicon Valley consultancy Digi-Capital said in a report last year.
“China has the potential to take more than $1 of every $5 spent” in the industry globally by 2022, it added.
Quality shortage
One key factor is China’s government.
Tens of millions of Chinese have become obsessive players of mobile video games, causing concern that China was raising a generation of myopic youngsters addicted to battle games.
Authorities imposed curbs last year on the number of new game releases and playing time for youths, rattling the industry and shaving billions off the market value of big players including gaming giant Tencent.
But the government is pushing hard for China to become a world leader in next-generation technologies including artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles. VR has been lumped into that favoured class, benefitting from a slew of preferential policies.
Chen Wei, manager of Shanghai VR arcade Machouse said VR was likely to avoid the fate of mobile video games in China.
He cites the relatively high cost of arcade play — up to 70 yuan ($10) or more for a 15-minute game — and of setting up home systems.
“It’s hard for minors to get addicted,” he said.
The nascent VR games industry suffers from a shortage of high-quality games, however.
At Shanghai’s VR+ Amusement Park, a new game lands only once every three months, officials there said.
VR explosion
Firms such as Tencent remain hesitant to dive in to the arcade scene until the sector reaches critical mass, analysts explained.
But the company, along with fellow Chinese giants Alibaba and Baidu, is investing in virtual online shopping and VR entertainment, all of which could trickle down into gaming.
Already a number of towns and cities in China have declared themselves incubator zones that are integrating VR into research, manufacturing, education and other spheres, luring in capital, according to Chinese reports.
Seekers VR, which is based in the eastern city of Wenzhou and owns a franchised chain of 200 arcades in more than 70 cities across China, is working with the Wenzhou government to establish a college focused on educating students about VR and using the technology in lessons.
“There is no dominant competitor in the VR industry since it is so immature, and we will bring more and more opportunity,” said Seekers VR’s CEO Belle Chen.
The expected wide-scale adoption in China of ultra-fast 5G networks is expected to further boost VR development, and foster growth in areas such as education and training, said Chen Wei.
He said: “There is no better way to learn skills, and at a lower cost, than VR. Even though VR is still educating users about what it is, it could explode someday.”

"In astrophysics milestone, first photo of black hole expected","
WASHINGTON: Scientists are expected to unveil on Wednesday the first-ever photograph of a black hole, a breakthrough in astrophysics providing insight into celestial monsters with gravitational fields so intense no matter or light can escape.
The U.S. National Science Foundation has scheduled a news conference in Washington to announce a “groundbreaking result from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project,” an international partnership formed in 2012 to try to directly observe the immediate environment of a black hole.
Simultaneous news conferences are scheduled in Brussels, Santiago, Shanghai, Taipei and Tokyo.

 A black hole’s event horizon, one of the most violent places in the universe, is the point of no return beyond which anything – stars, planets, gas, dust, all forms of electromagnetic radiation including light – gets sucked in irretrievably.
While scientists involved in the research declined to disclose the findings ahead of the formal announcement, they are clear about their goals.
“It’s a visionary project to take the first photograph of a black hole. We are a collaboration of over 200 people internationally,” astrophysicist Sheperd Doeleman, director of the Event Horizon Telescope at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard &amp; Smithsonian, said at a March event in Texas.
The news conference is scheduled for 9 a.m. (1300 GMT) on Wednesday.
The research will put to the test a scientific pillar – physicist Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity, according to University of Arizona astrophysicist Dimitrios Psaltis, project scientist for the Event Horizon Telescope. That theory, put forward in 1915, was intended to explain the laws of gravity and their relation to other natural forces.
Supermassive black holes
The researchers targeted two supermassive black holes.
The first – called Sagittarius A* – is situated at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy, possessing 4 million times the mass of our sun and located 26,000 light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).
The second – called M87 – resides at the center of the neighboring Virgo A galaxy, boasting a mass 3.5 billion times that of the sun and located 54 million light-years away from Earth. Streaming away from M87 at nearly the speed of light is a humongous jet of subatomic particles.
Black holes, coming in a variety of sizes, are extraordinarily dense entities formed when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. Supermassive black holes are the largest kind, devouring matter and radiation and perhaps merging with other black holes.
Psaltis described a black hole as “an extreme warp in spacetime,” a term referring to the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time joined into a single four-dimensional continuum.
Doeleman said the project’s researchers obtained the first data in April 2017 from a global network of telescopes. The telescopes that collected that initial data are located in the U.S. states of Arizona and Hawaii as well as Mexico, Chile, Spain and Antarctica. Since then, telescopes in France and Greenland have been added to the network.
The scientists also will be trying to detect for the first time the dynamics near the black hole as matter orbits at near light speeds before being swallowed into oblivion.
The fact that black holes do not allow light to escape makes viewing them difficult. The scientists will be looking for a ring of light – radiation and matter circling at tremendous speed at the edge of the event horizon – around a region of darkness representing the actual black hole. This is known as the black hole’s shadow or silhouette.
Einstein’s theory, if correct, should allow for an extremely accurate prediction of the size and shape of a black hole.
“The shape of the shadow will be almost a perfect circle in Einstein’s theory,” Psaltis said. “If we find it to be different than what the theory predicts, then we go back to square one and we say, ‘Clearly, something is not exactly right.’”

"Carmaker, Tencent tie up to develop self-driving cars software: report","
SEOUL: South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co and Chinese technology firm Tencent Holdings have signed a preliminary deal to develop software for driverless vehicles, South Korea’s Maeil Business Newspaper reported on Saturday.
Both companies plan to conduct joint research and development on safety and security systems for self-driving cars, which Hyundai seeks to roll out commercially by 2030, the report, which cited unnamed industry sources, said.
The agreement was signed on the sidelines of a business forum held in Seoul on Thursday by the South Korean government and China’s Guangdong province, it said.

 Hyundai and Tencent did not offer any immediate comments on the report.
The two companies are also exploring ways to utilize Tencent’s popular WeChat messaging app in developing China-targeted car models, the newspaper said.
Hyundai, the world’s 5th largest automaker together with affiliate Kia Motors, has been fostering partnerships with self-driving tech and social media firms as it aims to introduce highly automated vehicles by 2020 and fully autonomous vehicles by 2030.
Hyundai Mobis, another affiliate of the car maker, clinched an agreement last month with Russia’s largest internet search engine Yandex to jointly develop control systems for driverless vehicles.
Shenzhen-based and Hong Kong-listed Tencent has also ventured into self-driving tech and had advertised to recruit engineers in Silicon Valley last year.

‘I never said Dilwale is like Inception’,"
Bollywood actor Varun Dhawan has finally explained the remark which started a social media storm and is still the most frequently asked question from the ‘Student of The Year’ star.
In the year 2015, after the trailer launch of ‘Dilwale’, the actor reportedly compared the Rohit Shetty movie with acclaimed Hollwyood filmaker Christopher Nolan’s ‘Inception’ and has since been ridiculed online and have been questioned about the remark several times since the day he made the remark.
Recently, in an interview with Arbaaz Khan, the actor denied comparing the two movies but also explained why the statement was attributed to him.

 “Let me explain it, for the last time, people can also see that clip online, the thing was that the (Dilwale) trailer was launched and one man told the press that we couldn’t understand anything (about the plot) from the trailer, so I was there and I tried to become a little cheeky and asked him did you see the Inception trailer? did you understand the trailer? so in the same way you didn’t understand this trailer,” said Dhawan.
The actor maintained that it may be a stupid statement but he never compared the two movies and it was some journalist who attributed this comparison statement to him.

Dilwale, the 2015 high-budget venture, starring heavy weights like Sharukh Khan and Kajol along with Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon flopped badly despite trying to capitalise on the popularity of the lead pair and a marketing campaign targeted at the ‘Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge’ audience.
Inception, starring Leonardo Di Caprio, was a hugely successful science fiction film and had nothing in common with the masala Bollywood flick.

‘Smallville’ actress Allison Mack pleads guilty in sex trafficking case,"
NEW YORK: “Smallville” actress Allison Mack on Monday pleaded guilty to blackmailing two women as part of an alleged New York sex cult that prosecutors called a racketeering operation that carried out sex trafficking and other crimes.
Mack, 36, entered her plea to racketeering and conspiracy charges before U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, admitting that she coerced the two unnamed women into performing services by threatening to release damaging information about them.
Fighting back tears, Mack said she had joined the organization, led by self-described spiritual guide Keith Raniere, a decade ago to find purpose in life.

 “Through it all, I believed that Keith Raniere’s intentions were to help people,” she said. “I was wrong. I now realize that I and others engaged in criminal conduct.”

There was no mention at the plea hearing of any agreement by Mack to cooperate with prosecutors against Raniere, who is expected to go on trial later this month. Mack’s lawyers declined to provide any further details about her plea deal.
Raniere, 58, was arrested on sex trafficking charges in March 2018, and is being held without bail. Mack was arrested the following month.
Prosecutors accused Raniere of running a cult-like secret society within his organization, Nxivm (pronounced “Nexium”), in which women were branded with his initials, put on extremely restrictive diets and forced to have sex with him.
Last month, prosecutors unsealed new charges accusing Raniere of sexually exploiting a minor.
Raniere, 58, was arrested on sex trafficking charges in March 2018, and is being held without bail
Raniere has pleaded not guilty. Marc Agnifilo, one of his lawyers, declined to comment on the case after Monday’s hearing. Agnifilo has previously said that his client’s sexual encounters with women in the organization were consensual, and denied the child pornography charges.
Nxivm on its website calls itself “a community guided by humanitarian principles that seek to empower people and answer important questions about what it means to be human.” The website now carries a message saying that all “enrollment, curriculum and events” are canceled “until further notice,” adding that “we continue to believe in the value and importance of our work.”
Two other people charged in the case, former Nxivm president Nancy Salzman and her daughter Lauren Salzman, previously pleaded guilty.
Also charged alongside Raniere are Seagram liquor heiress Clare Bronfman and Nxivm member Kathy Russell, who have pleaded not guilty.
“Smallville,” a television series that ran from 2001 to 2011, featured a young Clark Kent before he became famous as Superman. Mack played Chloe Sullivan, a close friend of the future Superman whose romantic feelings were not reciprocated.

Now, the ‘Kalank’ actress has finally responded to the criticism.
Speaking to Pinkvilla in an interview, the actress said that she hasn’t got any criticism on being paired opposite Salman Khan adding that neither Salman nor Sanjay Leela Bhansali gets bothered by the criticism they receive.
“I didn’t get any criticism. I think I got a lot of excitement. I think speculation is also a form of excitement in a way and why shouldn’t there be speculation. There should be and at least I am not bothered by that and I don’t think Salman or Bhansali sir are bothered. I think this is a filmmaker who has given us very good films, he is someone who we all are very fond of and I think we should just trust him with his vision,” the actress told Pinkvilla.

Fan threatens to kill Varun Dhawan’s girlfriend,"
MUMBAI: A fan of Bollywood actor Varun Dhawan threatened to kill his girlfriend Natasha Dalal outside his residence in Mumbai, reports in Indian media said.
According to a report in Indian news website India Today, a female fan arrived at the ‘Badlapur’ actor’s residence and wanted to meet him.
The female fan waited for hours outside the actor’s residence despite being told by the security that she can’t meet the Varun Dhawan asactor was busy in his film’s promotions.

 The report suggests that the girl got upset, started shouting and also made threats.
“I will kill Natasha,” she shot back at guards who had to call the police to handle the situation.
Reports say a complaint at Santa Cruz police station was filed but the First Information Report (FIR) will be lodged only after Varun records his statement.
The actor, lauded for his performances in movies like ‘Badlapur’ and ‘October’, has not commented on the matter yet.

‘Shayan is the ideal husband’: Here is why ‘Cheekh’ fans are gushing over Emmad Irfani’s character,"
As if Saba Qamar, Aijaz Aslam and Bilal Abbas Khan’s phenomenal acting was not enough to keep audiences hooked over ARY Digital drama serial ‘Cheekh’, enters Emmad Irfani and steals the show in just two scenes.
SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS
Yes, two scenes is what it took for Emmad Irfani’s character Shayan to become the heartthrob of thousands of girls who are now terming him the ideal husband.

 If the viewers’ comments on Cheekh’s Episode 14 are something to go by, girls are terming him the ideal husband for what he did in the face of increasing pressure from his family to leave Mannat and the way he dealt with the antagonist Wajih.
HERE IS THE FIRST SCENE

As Wajih (played by Bilal Abbas Khan) continued harassing Mannat, Shayan asked Mannat to leave the house leaving her in tears but as soon as the duo reached her house and audiences were confused as to what Shayan has done after meeting Asad (Haya’s former fiance), he delivered dialogues which have won the internet.
‘Tumhe Talaq De K Tum Pe Lagay Ilzamat Sach Sabit Nahi Honey Dunga Main,” said Shayan. (I will not prove your accusers right by divorcing you).

Then the gentleman addressed Mannat’s mother, who was worried that Mannat might have taken divorce from him and said that “Ye meri amanat ha jo apke ghar chorne aya hun, wo bhi us waqt tak jb tk mein apne ghar ka bndobst nahii krleta,” (I am leaving her here only until I buy my own house).
The lines not only brought a smile of confidence upon Mannat’s face but the drama’s millions of fans too heaved a sigh of relief.
Well, This Was Not All, He Was There to Win More Hearts In the Second Scene

The man went straight to his home where his brothers and sister Haya were waiting for him only to be greeted by Yawar (played by Aijaz Aslam) who said he will get their divorce papers ready.
Shayan not only refused to divorce Mannat but also cleared his brothers’ misconceptions in an emotional exchange.

As Wajih stood up and again accused Mannat of having an affair with Asad, the man slapped him and then revealed that he knows the whole truth and is ashamed of calling him (Wajih) his brother.
The audiences are even loving the slap and have expressed their love for the way he revealed the thing before Haya, who is also now doubting Wajih and Yawar.
Here are some comments about the ‘ideal husband’

Here is how some people ‘loved’ how he slapped Wajih
Many viewers not only ‘loved’ how he slapped Wajih, the murderer, but one viewer also commented that she watched it six times.

Box Office: ‘Shazam!’ grows to $53 million debut,"
LOS ANGELES: The magic word at the box office this weekend was “Shazam!” Warner Bros.’ latest DC superhero adventure easily topped charts in North America, pocketing $53 million when it debuted in 4,217 venues.
Buoyed by positive reviews, “Shazam!” arrived ahead of expectations, which anticipated a start around $40 million to $45 million. The film, made by Warner Bros.’ New Line division, also earned $3 million in advanced screenings, bringing its domestic haul to $56 million. Overseas, “Shazam!” dominated with $102 million from 79 international markets for a global start to $158.6 million.
While “Shazam!’s” domestic opening weekend is on the lower side for a traditional comic-book movie, it was significantly less expensive to make compared to other films in the genre that are heavy on special effects. That means “Shazam!” doesn’t have to reach the same box office heights as other DC Comic entries like “Aquaman” and “Wonder Woman” to turn a profit. Warner Bros. and New Line spent $98 million to produce “Shazam!,” proving that studios can crank out a solid superhero installment without breaking the bank. Prior DC films like “Justice League” and “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” on the other hand, cost upward of $300 million before taking marketing and distribution into count.

Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros. president of domestic distribution, said this weekend’s “thrilling result” was because “Shazam!” doesn’t take itself too seriously. Though it’s still in the superhero genre, it feels lighter in tone than the influx of comic-book titles in theaters. “It was about having fun,” he said.
“‘Wonder Woman and ‘Aquaman’ were very dark and dramatic and different,” Goldstein added. “It shows we’re making a variety of different movies that can all live in the same space.” “Shazam!” — described as “Big” meets “Superman” — centers on Billy Baston (Asher Angel), a teenager who transforms into a superhero (Zachary Levi) when someone says the magic word. Both critics and fans praised the movie for its lighter take on the genre, compared to the apocalyptic storylines in comic-book adaptations. Moviegoers awarded with an A CinemaScore. Males accounted for 57 percent of opening weekend audiences, while 45 percent of crowds were under the age of 25.
Though “Shazam!” led the way in North America, Paramount’s horror remake “Pet Sematary” also had a strong start, scaring up $25 million when it debuted in 3,585 locations. The supernatural thriller, based on Stephen King’s novel, cost $21 million to produce.
“Pet Sematary” holds an 61 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and a C+ CinemaScore. Starring Jason Clarke, Amy Seimetz, and John Lithgow, the film follows a family who, upon moving to rural Maine, discovers their new home is located near a mysterious burial ground that sets off a chain of horrific events. Audiences were 52 percent male, with 58 percent of ticket buyers over the age of 25.
“Pet Sematary” came in at the higher end of expectations. Paramount’s domestic distribution chief Kyle Davies says moviegoers latched onto the movie because it challenges audiences.
“Spring suddenly got very competitive. I think this rose above the fray because it’s one of Stephen King’s most popular books and the filmmakers did a great job delivering the scares,” Davies said. “They really paid respect to the original source material, but added some new twists.”
The final newcomer this weekend was “Best of Enemies,” starring Taraji P. Henson and Sam Rockwell as a civil rights activist and a KKK leader forced to work together. It pulled in an underwhelming $4.5 million from 1,705 screens. Astute Films fully financed the film, which was distributed by STXfilms. Older moviegoers aren’t generally a demographic that rushes out to see a movie on opening weekend, so the studio anticipates that word of mouth about the feel-good drama will grow in the coming weeks, leading to a long life in theaters. Nearly 80 percent of moviegoers were over the age of 25, and 63 percent were female.
A number of holdovers filled out North American box office charts. In third place, Disney’s re-imagining of “Dumbo” earned $18.2 million in its sophomore outing, marking a steep 60 percent drop from its debut. Directed by Tim Burton, the remake of Disney’s 1941 classic has surpassed $200 million globally, including $76 million in North America.
Universal and Jordan Peele’s “Us,” now in its third weekend of release, amassed another $13 million for a domestic haul of $152 million. The psychological thriller, starring Lupita Nyong’o and Winston Duke, hit $200 million in ticket sales worldwide.
Rounding out the top five is Disney’s “Captain Marvel,” adding $12.7 million. Starring Brie Larson, the superhero tentpole has crossed $1 billion in ticket sales, with $373 million of that bounty coming from North American theaters.
Among specialty releases, Neon’s Aretha Franklin documentary “Amazing Grace” made $57,353 from three theaters, averaging $19,118 per location. The non-fiction film, which was 46 years in the making, captures the Queen of Soul as she records her wildly successful album in a Baptist church.
Elsewhere, Amazon Studio’s released “Peterloo,” a historical drama about the deadly 1819 massacre in Manchester, in three locations. It pocketed $30,426 for a per-screen-average of $10,142.
This weekend continued to prove that scares and superheroes are some of the most reliable money-makers at the box office. Overall, ticket sales are still pacing around 16 percent behind last year, according to Comscore. That gap is shrinking as films like “Captain Marvel” and “Us” impress audiences, and Marvel’s “Avengers: Endgame,” the studio’s epic conclusion that is expected to shatter records, could help close that margin even more.

Bill Cosby settles defamation lawsuit brought by seven women,"
Convicted sex offender Bill Cosby on Friday settled a federal defamation lawsuit brought by seven women who said the former actor and comedian sexually assaulted them and wrongly called them liars when they went public with their charges years later.
The settlement ends a court fight that predates the 81-year-old’s conviction a year ago for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, a former Temple University administrator, in 2004. Cosby is currently serving a 3- to 10-year sentence for that crime, though his lawyers plan an appeal.
He was the first celebrity convicted of sexual misconduct since the rise of the #MeToo movement, which cast a harsh light on widespread patterns of sexual harassment or abuse in multiple spheres of American life and ended the careers of dozens of powerful men in American media, politics and business.

 The settlement covers seven of some 50 women who emerged over the past decade to level sex abuse charges against the once-beloved star of “The Cosby Show,” who built a decades-long career on a family-friendly style of comedy.
All the allegations but Constand’s were too old to be the subject of criminal prosecution, which prompted the seven women to sue for defamation when Cosby accused them of lying.
“Each Plaintiff is satisfied with the settlement,” attorneys for Cosby said in papers filed in U.S. District Court in Springfield, Massachusetts, near one of Cosby’s homes. They did not disclose the terms of the agreement.
The defamation suit was filed in December 2014. One of the seven, Louisa Moritz, an actress best known for appearing in “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” died in January at age 72.
The other plaintiffs were Barbara Bowman, who said she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress when she was assaulted in 1985; Tamara Green, who said she was a young model in the early 1970s when she was attacked; actress Angela Leslie, who said her attack took place in 1992; Therese Serignese, now a registered nurse who said she was 19 when she was attacked in 1976; Joan Tarshis, who said she was 19 at the time of her attack in 1969; and Linda Traitz, who said she was an 18-year-old waitress when she became a victim in 1969.
Cosby has denied the accusations and maintained his innocence.

This baby rocker is being linked to 32 infant deaths,"
WASHINGTON: The American Academy of Pediatrics called on the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) on Tuesday to issue a full recall of the “Fisher-Price Rock ‘n Play Sleeper” infant rocker, which has been linked to 32 infant deaths, it said on its website.
The infant deaths were tallied by an analysis from the consumer watchdog group, Consumer Reports.
“AAP urges all parents to stop using the product immediately,” the pediatricians’ association said in an announcement.

 ﻿
“This product is deadly and should be recalled immediately,” said Kyle Yasuda, president of the pediatrician group.
A representative for Fisher-Price could not be reached early Wednesday.
But the company said on its website that it voluntarily issued a joint alert with the CPSC on April 5, to “warn parents and caregivers to discontinue use of Rock ‘n Play Sleeper when infants begin to roll over,” or when the child turns three months old.

“Child safety is our priority,” the company said.
The deaths occur when infants rolled from their backs to their stomach or side and could not breath, the joint alert said.
The sleeper features a cradle on a metal stand that rocks infants. The company said it will continue to work with the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
But the AAP said on Tuesday that the warning does not go far enough.
“We cannot put any more children’s lives at risk by keeping these dangerous products on the shelves,” Rachel Moon, a doctor with the AAP said in the statement.
A representative with the CPSC was not available early Wednesday.

Century-old bacteria from sick soldier offer clues to cholera epidemics,"
Scientists have mapped the genome of a strain of cholera extracted a century ago from a sick British soldier during World War One and found clues to how some cholera bacteria strains cause epidemics today.
The bug – thought to be the oldest publicly available sample of the V. cholerae bacterium – was isolated in 1916 from the soldier’s “choleraic diarrhoea” while he was convalescing in Egypt, the researchers said.
But their analysis of its genetic code showed it was a non-toxigenic strain and that the soldier was probably sick with some other infection.

 The strain was, however, distantly related to strains of cholera bacteria that are causing current outbreaks and have sparked epidemics in the past.
“Even though this isolate (bacterial sample) did not cause an outbreak it is important to study those that do not cause disease as well as those that do,” said Nick Thomson, who co-led the study at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge, UK.
“Studying strains from different points in time can give deep insights into the evolution of this species of bacteria and link that to historical reports of human disease.”
Cholera is a severe diarrhoeal disease caused by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with toxigenic cholera bacteria. It can spread rapidly in areas with poor sanitation and has cause several historical global epidemics, or pandemics.
Experts say one of these outbreaks, known as the “sixth pandemic”, coincided with World War One.
Outbreaks of cholera are currently spreading in several countries including Yemen and Mozambique. The World Health Organization says the disease is “a global threat”, and experts estimate there are between 1.3 and 4.0 million cases and between 21,000 and 143,000 cholera deaths worldwide each year.
Matthew Dorman, who co-led the research, said the analysis of also revealed the 1916 strain had certain faults, including lacking a flagellum – a thin tail that enables bacteria to swim.
“We discovered a mutation in a gene critical for growing flagella, which may be the reason for this,” Dorman said.
The research was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B journal on Wednesday.

Losses more than $1 bn in major US health fraud: investigators,"
One of the largest healthcare frauds in American history caused more than $1 billion in losses after hundreds of thousands of patients were lured into the scheme, US investigators said Tuesday, announcing charges against 24 people.
The alleged scheme involved the provision of wrist, knee and other braces to elderly and/or disabled patients who did not need them, but who were covered by the Medicare public insurance system.
They were lured by an international telemarketing network involving call centers in the Philippines and Latin America, the Department of Justice said.

 The defendants allegedly paid doctors to prescribe the braces without meeting patients.
“Proceeds of the fraudulent scheme were allegedly laundered through international shell corporations and used to purchase exotic automobiles, yachts and luxury real estate in the United States and abroad,” DOJ said in a statement.
Medicare got the bills which allegedly reached more than $1.7 billion in claims.
Those charged in the multi-state operation included CEOs and other executives with telemedicine companies, the owners of dozens of medical equipment firms, and doctors.
DOJ said the schemes involved “more than $1.2 billion in loss.”
Administrative penalties were also issued against 130 orthopedic equipment suppliers, DOJ said.
“Today, one of the largest healthcare fraud schemes in US history came to an end,” said Robert Johnson, assistant director of the FBI, one of several agencies involved.
US Attorney Sherri Lydon, of South Carolina, added that white collar crime is not victimless.
“All taxpayers will endure the rising cost of healthcare premiums and out-of-pocket costs as a result of fraud on our Medicare system,” Lydon said.
The Medicare system was created in the 1960s to provide public health insurance for Americans older than 65. It has been extended to the poorest, disabled, children, and military veterans, now covering 112 million people.
But the system is regularly defrauded.
The Medicare Fraud Strike Force, created in 2007, has charged nearly 4,000 people related to billings of more than $14 billion in total, DOJ said.

Is shark meat safe to eat?,"
Shark meat is being sold in Karachi and other big cities of the country openly and covertly by a number of fish sellers.
﻿
Reports say the boneless fish is also being sold as finger fish and its meat is being used in fish kabab and fish pulao at various restaurants.

 ARY News’ Bakhabar Savera team invited Director Sindh Fisheries Department Dr Rehana Asghar Chaudhry to educate viewers about whether the fish is Halal, why is there a particular stink in shark meat, is it safe to eat and who should consume it or avoid it.
“Shark meat is not haraam, it is dangerous They are without the usual urinary tract, so they concentrate urea in their blood and excrete it through their skin. When they die or are killed, the urea turns into ammonia which causes a strong stink. There is a certain way in which it should be cleaned before consumption,” said Dr Chaudhry.
The SFD director said that shark can only be consumed after washing it with acetic acid and lactic acid to remove urea.
She revealed that a number of fried fish points buy shark meat and sell it (without washing) as finger fish and make fish kababs out of it so the better option- if you wish to eat shark meat- is to buy the fish and then clean it using acetic acid and lactic acid to remove urea and then fry it at home.
