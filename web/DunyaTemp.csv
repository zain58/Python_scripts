New Zealand disarms police as terror threat level lowered,"
WELLINGTON (AFP) - New Zealand police on Wednesday ended the routine arming of frontline officers as the terrorism threat level was lowered a month after the Christchurch mosques massacre.
Police and security agencies reduced the threat level from high to medium, meaning authorities judge that another attack, violent criminal behaviour, or violent protest remains ""feasible"" rather than ""very likely"".
The level is still higher than it was before the March 15 attacks, when the threat was deemed to be ""low"".
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said ""there is no current specific threat"", but the security agencies believed the medium level ""accurately reflects our current status"".
Frontline New Zealand police have historically not carried firearms and many people were shocked to see them heavily armed after 50 Muslims were gunned down while at Friday prayers.
Police commissioner Mike Bush said with the easing of the security threat level, the police had reassessed their position on arming frontline staff and the carrying of weapons would now be decided on a case-by-case basis.
The decision was made after ""significant consultation"" with mosques and Islamic Centres in relation to ongoing security, although Bush said he would not release details.
""There was never any intention for the routine carriage of firearms to continue indefinitely,"" Bush said.
""Generally this means frontline staff will transition back to our normal approach regarding carriage and access to firearms.
The police also released a timeline of the mosque attacks, showing it took 18 minutes from the time of the first emergency call to the apprehension of the alleged shooter.

Valley of the dolls: scarecrows outnumber people in Japan village,"
NAGORO (AFP) - In the tiny village of Nagoro, deep in the mountains of western Japan, the wind howls down a deserted street with not a living soul to be seen.
But yet the street appears busy, dotted with life-sized dolls that outnumber humans 10 to one, the product of a one-woman bid to counter the emptiness and loneliness felt in Nagoro, like many Japanese villages decimated by depopulation.
Nagoro, around 550 kilometres (400 miles) southwest of Tokyo, has become known as the valley of dolls after local resident Tsukimi Ayano began placing scarecrows on the street to inject some life into her depopulated village.
""Only 27 people live in this village but the number of scarecrows is tenfold, like 270,"" the 69-year-old doll maker told AFP in an interview at her home.
It all started 16 years ago when the dexterous Ayano created a scarecrow dressed in her father’s clothes to prevent birds eating the seeds she had planted in her garden.
""A worker who saw it in the garden thought it really was my father... he said hello but it was a scarecrow. It was funny,"" recalled Ayano.
Since then, Ayano has not stopped creating the life-size dolls, made with wooden sticks, newspapers to fill the body, elastic fabrics for skin and knitting wool for hair.
The skillful craftswoman needs only three days to make an adult-sized doll that are now scattered all around the village.
The secret to breathing life into the dolls? Applying pink colour to the lips and cheeks with a make-up brush, revealed Ayano.
At the local school, she has placed 12 colourful child-sized dolls at desks, positioned as if part of a lively class poring over their books.
The school closed seven years ago as there was no one left to teach, she recalled sadly.
""Now there are no children. The youngest person here is 55 years old.""
Down the street, a ""family"" of scarecrows lounges in front of an abandoned grocery shop while a doll dressed as an old farmer window-shops next door.
Near the bus stop, a group of scarecrows gathers as another ""father"" doll pulls a cart full of ""children.""

‘It’s lonely now’ 


While never humming with people, Ayano remembers as a child that Nagoro was once a well-to-do place with some 300 residents and labourers supported by the forestry industry and dam construction work.
""People gradually left... It’s lonely now,"" she said. ""I made more dolls as I remembered the time when the village was lively.""
Nagoro’s plight is replicated all around Japan, as the world’s third-largest economy battles a declining population, low birth rate and high life expectancy.
The country is on the verge of becoming the first ""ultra-aged"" country in the world, meaning that 28 percent of people are aged 65 or above.
The latest government report shows that 27.7 percent of a population of 127 million -- one in four people -- are aged 65 or older and the figure is expected to jump to 37.7 percent in 2050.
According to experts, around 40 percent of Japan’s 1,700 municipalities are defined as ""depopulated.""

‘Extremely difficult’ 


After World War II, when forestry and agriculture were the main economic drivers, many Japanese lived in rural villages like Nagoro. But young people started to leave for Tokyo in the 1960s, said Takumi Fujinami, economist at the Japan Research Institute.
""The economy was booming in Tokyo and industrial areas at that time. They were the only places people could earn money, so a lot of young people moved there,"" he said.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged to revive regions outside Tokyo by pumping in tens of billions of yen, but this is not enough to stop young people from leaving their hometowns to work in Tokyo, Fujinami said.
""In order to combat depopulation, we need people moving in to depopulated areas. But recovering the population is extremely difficult,"" he said.
""Instead, it’s important to increase income or improve working conditions for young people in rural areas.""
For example, companies in rural areas tend to have fewer holidays than those in Tokyo, he said.
""We need to create communities where young people can make a long-term living ,"" Fujinami said, adding that subsidising them to move in is not enough.
While there is little evidence of citizens returning to Nagoro, Ayano’s dolls have attracted flesh-and-blood people from as far afield as the US and France.
""Before I started making scarecrows, nobody stopped by. Now many people visit here,"" she said.
""I hope Nagoro will become lively again and many people come here for sightseeing.""
""I don’t know what Nagoro will look like in 10 or 20 years... but I’ll keep on making dolls."" ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-17-19/news_big_images/487358_19452946.jpg,world,"They were the only places people could earn money, so a lot of young people moved there,"" he said.",neutral
Trump vetoes bill to end US support for Saudi-led Yemen war,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday vetoed a resolution from Congress directing him to end US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, the second such move of his presidency.
The resolution was a harsh bipartisan rebuke to Trump that took the historic step of curtailing a president s war-making powers -- a step he condemned in a statement announcing his veto.
""This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,"" Trump said.
The veto was the second of his presidency, after he overrode a congressional resolution that aimed to reverse the border emergency he declared in order to secure more funding for his wall between the United States and Mexico in March.
Vetoing the measure is an ""effective green light for the war strategy that has created the world s worst humanitarian crisis to continue,"" said International Rescue Committee president and CEO David Miliband.
""Yemen is at a breaking point with 10 million people on the brink of famine. There are as many as 100 civilian casualties per week, and Yemenis are more likely to be killed at home than in any other structure.""
Trump argued that US support for the bloody war between the Saudi-backed Yemeni government and Iran-aligned Huthi rebels was necessary for a variety of reasons, ""first and foremost"" to ""protect the safety of the more than 80,000 Americans who reside in certain coalition countries.""
These countries ""have been subject to Huthi attacks from Yemen,"" he said, referring to drone and missile strikes the Saudi-led coalition has either claimed were intercepted or denied altogether.
The president also said the resolution would ""harm the foreign policy of the United States"" and ""harm our bilateral relationships.""
And it would ""negatively affect our ongoing efforts to prevent civilian casualties and prevent the spread of terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS, and embolden Iran s malign activities in Yemen,"" Trump said, referring to two Sunni Muslim militant groups and his Shiite bete noire.
The resolution, which passed the US House of Representatives earlier this month and the Senate in March, was a historic milestone, as it was the first time in history that a measure invoking the 1973 War Powers Resolution reached the president s desk.
Democrats argued that US involvement in the Yemen conflict -- through intelligence-sharing, logistical support and now-discontinued aerial refueling -- is unconstitutional without congressional authority.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi -- the country s most senior Democratic politician -- took aim at Trump s veto in a series of tweets on Tuesday.
""The conflict in Yemen is a horrific humanitarian crisis that challenges the conscience of the entire world,"" Pelosi wrote. ""Yet the President has cynically chosen to contravene a bipartisan, bicameral vote of the Congress & perpetuate America s shameful involvement in this heartbreaking crisis.""
Senator Bernie Sanders, a lead author of the Yemen resolution and a Democratic 2020 presidential candidate, said that ""the people of Yemen desperately need humanitarian help, not more bombs.""
""I am disappointed, but not surprised, that Trump has rejected the bi-partisan resolution to end U.S. involvement in the horrific war in Yemen,"" Sanders tweeted.
Critics of the intervention warn that Saudi forces are likely using US weapons to commit atrocities in the four-year war.
Some 10,000 people have been killed in Yemen over the past four years, according to the World Health Organization, although rights groups say the toll could be five times higher.
Both the Saudi-led alliance and Huthi rebels have been accused of acts that could amount to war crimes, while the coalition has been blacklisted by the United Nations for killing and maiming children.

UN in negotiations on Libya ceasefire,"
UNITED NATIONS (AFP) - United Nations Security Council diplomats began negotiations Tuesday on a British-drafted resolution that would demand an immediate ceasefire in Libya after forces loyal to commander Khalifa Haftar launched an offensive on Tripoli.
The proposed text seen by AFP warns that the offensive by Haftar s Libyan National Army (LNA) ""threatens the stability of Libya and prospects for a United Nations-facilitated political dialogue and a comprehensive political solution to the crisis.""
The council ""demands that all parties in Libya immediately de-escalate the situation, commit to a ceasefire, and engage with the United Nations to ensure a full and comprehensive cessation of hostilities throughout Libya,"" the draft says.
After Britain circulated the text late Monday, a first round of negotiations was held during which Russia raised objections to references criticizing Haftar, diplomats said.
""They were very clear. No reference anywhere,"" a council diplomat said.
Britain was hoping to bring the measure to a vote at the council before Friday, but diplomats pointed to Russia s objections as a hurdle.
At least 174 people have been killed and more than 18,000 displaced since Haftar ordered his forces to march on Tripoli on April 4, according to UN figures. A rocket attack on the city killed two people and injured four on Tuesday.
Last week, Russia blocked a draft council statement that would have called on Haftar s forces to halt their advance on Tripoli.
The proposed measure echoed a call for a ceasefire by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who was in Libya to personally advance prospects for a political solution when the offensive was launched.
Haftar, seen by his allies Egypt and the United Arab Emirates as a bulwark against Islamists, has declared he wants to seize the capital, now controlled by a UN-recognized government and an array of militias.
Haftar backs a rival administration based in eastern Libya that is refusing to recognize the authority of the Tripoli government.
The draft resolution calls on all sides in Libya ""immediately to re-commit"" to UN peace efforts and urges all member-states ""to use their influence over the parties"" to see that the resolution is respected.
Resolutions adopted by the council are legally binding.
Diplomats have long complained that foreign powers backing rival sides in Libya threatened to turn the conflict into a proxy war.
Saudi Arabia is also seen as a key Haftar supporter, while Qatar -- which has tense ties with Riyadh and Abu Dhabi -- has called for stronger enforcement of the UN arms embargo to keep weapons out of Haftar s hands.
Russia and France, two permanent council members, have praised Haftar s battlefield successes in defeating Libyan armed groups aligned with the Islamic State in the south of the country.
Haftar s offensive on the capital forced the United Nations to postpone a national conference that was to draw up a roadmap to elections, meant to turn the page on years of chaos since the 2011 ouster of Moamer Kadhafi.
Guterres has said that serious negotiations on Libya s future cannot resume without a ceasefire.

Muslim-majority Indonesia votes in its biggest-ever election,"
JAKARTA (AFP) - Indonesia kicked off one of the world s biggest one-day elections Wednesday, pitting president Joko Widodo against ex-general Prabowo Subianto in a race to lead the Muslim-majority nation.
More than 190 million Indonesians are set to cast a ballot as polls opened shortly after 7:00 am local time (2200 GMT Tuesday) in restive Papua. The vote is slated to end at 1:00 pm (0600 GMT) in Sumatra at the other end of the volcano-dotted archipelago.
Some voters went to their local mosque before casting ballots, as the daily call to prayer sounded across a nation that is nearly 90 percent Muslim.
A record 245,000 candidates are running for public office, from the presidency and parliamentary seats to local positions -- the first time all are being held on the same day.
Opinion polls show Widodo, 57, is a clear favourite -- but he faces a tough challenge from Subianto, 67, who has leaned on a fiery nationalist ticket and warned he will challenge the results over voter-list irregularities if he loses.
Subianto narrowly lost to Widodo in 2014 elections, and unsuccessfully challenged those results.
Voters will flock to more than 800,000 polling stations where they ll punch holes in ballots -- to make clear their candidate choice -- and then dip a finger in Muslim-approved halal ink, a measure to prevent double-voting in a graft-riddled country where ballot-buying is rife.
The polls present a huge logistical challenge in a country stretching 4,800 kilometres across more than 17,000 islands with a population of more than 260 million, including hundreds of ethnic groups and languages.
Officials were moving cardboard ballot boxes by motorbikes, boats and planes -- as well as elephants and horses -- to reach mountaintop villages and communities deep in the jungle.
A series of so-called ""quick counts"" are expected to give a reliable indication of the presidential winner later Wednesday. Official results are not expected until May.
The poll has been punctuated by bitter mudslinging and a slew of fake news online that threatens to sway millions of undecided voters.
Widodo has campaigned on his ambitious drive to build much-needed roads, airports and other infrastructure across Southeast Asia s largest economy.
But his rights record has been criticised owing to an uptick in discriminatory attacks on religious and other minorities, including a small LGBT community, as Islamic hardliners become more vocal in public life.
His choice of conservative cleric Ma ruf Amin as his running mate has also raised fears about the future of Indonesia s reputation for moderate Islam.
Raised in a bamboo shack in a riverside slum, the soft-spoken Widodo stands in stark contrast to Subianto, whose strongman image is underscored by a penchant for slamming lecterns as he accuses Jakarta of selling the country off to foreign interests.
Subianto -- joined by running mate Sandiaga Uno, a 49-year-old wealthy financier -- has courted Islamic hardliners, promised a boost to military and defence spending and, taking a page from US President Donald Trump, vowed to put ""Indonesia first"" by reviewing billions of dollars in Chinese investment.
Subianto s long-held presidential ambitions have been dogged by strong ties to the Suharto dictatorship, which collapsed two decades ago, and a chequered past.
He ordered the abduction of democracy activists as the authoritarian regime collapsed in 1998, and was accused of committing atrocities in East Timor.

Saudi king hosts Abu Dhabi crown prince amid Sudan turmoil,"
RIYADH (AFP) - Saudi Arabia s King Salman on Tuesday hosted Abu Dhabi s crown prince for talks, state media said, after the Gulf allies threw their support behind Sudan s military rulers who ousted veteran leader Omar al-Bashir.
Abu Dhabi s Prince Mohammed bin Zayed discussed ""regional developments"" with the king and his powerful son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the official Saudi Press Agency said in a brief report.
After weeks of silence on Sudan s political turmoil, Saudi Arabia and the UAE on Sunday released a brief reaction to Bashir s toppling following months of street protests, calling for ""stability"" and a ""peaceful transition"".
Saudi Arabia and the UAE both voiced backing for Sudan s Transitional Military Council, with Riyadh promising an aid package to Sudanese people.
Sudan plays a key role in the regional interests of Saudi Arabia and its allies, siding with Riyadh against Shiite Iran and providing troops in the Saudi-led coalition fighting in the Yemen war.
A senior Sudanese military official on Monday said troops from his country will remain in Yemen until the Arab alliance achieves its goals.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE intervened in the Yemen war in 2015 to fight Iran-aligned Huthi rebels.
The Gulf powerhouses are also following events in Libya, where forces loyal to warlord Khalifa Haftar launched an offensive on Tripoli, now controlled by a UN-recognised government and an array of militias.
Haftar s close ties to Saudi Arabia and the UAE are critical to his campaign, observers say.
Saudi Arabia is said to have recently pledged tens of millions of dollars to the warlord s forces, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Egypt parliament votes to extend Sisi rule,"
CAIRO (AFP) - Egypt s parliament on Tuesday approved constitutional amendments allowing general-turned-president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to stay in power until 2030, state media reported.
Deputies also backed other sweeping changes to the constitution including to give the military greater influence in political life as well as granting Sisi more control over the judiciary.
The amendments are expected to be put to a public referendum later this month.
""The president s current term shall expire at the end of six years from the date of his election as president in 2018,"" reported the official Al-Ahram news website and broadcaster Nile TV.
""He can be re-elected for another (six-year) term.""
Sisi led the army s overthrow of elected president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 following mass protests against the Islamist leader s rule.
He won his first term as president in 2014 and was re-elected in March 2018 with more than 97 percent of the vote, after standing virtually unopposed.
His government has been widely criticised by human rights groups for the repression of political opponents.
But Mohamed Abu Hamed, a member of parliament who pushed for the constitutional amendments to keep Sisi in power, was adamant the changes were needed to allow him to complete political and economic reforms.
""The constitution in 2014 was written under tough exceptional circumstances,"" he told AFP.
The deputy hailed Sisi as a president who ""took important political, economic and security measures... (and) must continue with his reforms,"" in the face of the unrest gripping neighbouring countries.
The vote comes after two veteran presidents were ousted in Algeria and Sudan and amid an escalation of the conflict in Libya.
Keeping Sisi in power, he added, reflected ""the will of the people"".
State-run Al-Ahram news website said several MPs carried Egyptian flags as they gathered for the vote inside the parliament while nationalistic songs played in the background.
The amendments were initially introduced in February by a parliamentary bloc supportive of Sisi and updated this week after several rounds of debates.
Prior to the amendments, Egypt s 2014 constitution stipulated only two four-year presidential terms.
The 596-seat parliament, which is dominated by Sisi loyalists, was elected in 2015, about a year after Sisi took office.
Since Sisi overthrew Morsi, Egypt has drawn heavy international criticism for its sweeping crackdown on dissent.
The authorities have jailed thousands of Morsi s supporters as well as liberal and secular activists, including a popular blogger, actors, singers and journalists.
As lawmakers debated the proposed changes, prominent dissident actors Khaled Abol Naga and Amr Waked denounced them as a power grab.
If passed, ""these amendments would take us back to a dictatorship fit for the Middle Ages,"" Waked told a news conference by rights groups in Geneva.
His fellow actor criticised Sisi s narrative that his rule brought stability.
""Where is there stability in a country that jails children... that treats people badly or that kills?"" he said.
Human Rights Watch has said the amendments would ""institutionalise authoritarianism"".
When Sisi visited Washington for talks with US President Donald Trump last week, HRW urged Congress to withhold endorsement of his bid to extend his rule.
""Congress needs to use its levers to pressure the Egyptian president to reverse course, starting with withdrawing these constitutional amendments set to consolidate authoritarian rule,"" said HRW s Michael Page.
Amnesty International has warned the constitutional amendments ""would worsen the devastating human rights crisis Egyptians are already facing"".
""They would grant President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and security forces free rein to further abuse their powers and suppress peaceful dissent for years to come,"" said Amnesty s Magdalena Mughrabi.
Other constitutional amendments include a quota for women s representation of no less than 25 percent in parliament and forming a second parliamentary chamber.

Macron vows to rebuild a 'more beautiful' Notre-Dame in 5 years,"
PARIS (AFP) - President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday vowed to rebuild Notre-Dame cathedral ""even more beautifully"" within five years, as France reeled with shock from the fire that gutted the great Paris landmark.
Macron announced the fast timescale -- for a process some experts said would take decades -- in an address to the nation where he hailed how the disaster had shown the capacity of France to mobilise and unite.
Pledges worth around 700 million euros ($790 million) have already been made Tuesday from French billionaires and businesses to restore the Gothic masterpiece.
Most of the roof has been destroyed, its steeple has collapsed and an unknown number of artifacts and paintings have been lost. The main organ, which had close to 8,000 pipes, has also suffered damage.
But the cathedral s walls, bell towers and the most famous circular stained-glass windows at France s most visited tourist attraction remain intact.
Macron s defiant comments indicated he wants the reconstruction of the cathedral to be completed by the time Paris hosts the Olympic Games in 2024.
""We will rebuild the cathedral even more beautifully and I want it to be finished within five years,"" Macron said from the Elysee Palace. ""And we can do it.""
Macron said that the dramatic fire had brought out the best in a country riven with divisions and since November shaken by sometimes violent protests against his rule.
""What we saw last night in Paris was our capacity to mobilise and to unite,"" Macron said, hailing France as a nation of ""builders"".
""Our history never stops and that we will always have trials to overcome,"" he said.
Images from inside the cathedral Tuesday showed its immense walls standing proud, with statues still in place and a gleaming golden cross above the altar.
However the floor was covered in charred rubble from the fallen roof and water while parts of the vaulting at the top of the cathedral had collapsed.
Junior interior minister Laurent Nunez told reporters at the scene that work to secure the structure would continue into Thursday, allowing firefighters access to remove remaining artifacts and artworks.
He said the building had been saved within a critical time window of 15-30 minutes by a team of 400 firefighters who worked flat out throughout the night.
Though ""some weaknesses"" in the 850-year-old structure had been identified, overall it is ""holding up OK"", he added.
President Donald Trump relayed Americans  ""condolences"" to Macron over the fire, the White House said.
French fire chiefs had earlier dismissed as ""risible"" comments by Trump that the fire should be tackled with water bombers, saying this risked destroying the entire edifice of the cathedral.
The Paris fire service said that the last remnants of the blaze were extinguished Tuesday, 15 hours after the fire broke out.
Renovation work on the steeple, where workers were replacing its lead covering, is widely suspected to have caused the inferno after the blaze broke out in an area under scaffolding.
Investigators interviewed witnesses overnight and began speaking with employees of five different construction companies that were working on the monument, said public prosecutor Remy Heitz.
""Nothing indicates this was a deliberate act,"" Heitz told reporters, adding that 50 investigators had been assigned to what he expected to be a ""long and complex"" case.
A public appeal for funds drew immediate support from French billionaires and other private donors as well as from countries including Germany, Italy and Russia which offered expertise.
French billionaire Bernard Arnault and his LVMH luxury conglomerate, rival high-end designer goods group Kering, Total oil company and cosmetics giant L Oreal each pledged 100 million euros or more.
Support came from outside France as well, with Apple chief Tim Cook announcing the tech giant would give an unspecified amount to help restore a ""precious heritage for future generations.""
But experts had warned a full restoration will take many years. ""I d say decades,"" said Eric Fischer, head of the foundation in charge of restoring the 1,000-year-old Strasbourg cathedral.
Thousands of Parisians and tourists watched in horror Monday as flames engulfed the building and rescuers tried to save as much as they could of the cathedral s treasures.
Many more came Tuesday to the banks of the river Seine to gaze at where the roof and steeple once stood.
A firefighter suffered injuries during the blaze, which at one point threatened to bring down one of the two monumental towers on the western facade of the cathedral that is visited by 13 million tourists each year.
The Holy Crown of Thorns, believed to have been worn by Jesus at his crucifixion, was saved by firefighters, as was a sacred tunic worn by 13th-century French king Louis IX.
Rescuers formed a human chain at the site of the disaster to evacuate as many artifacts as possible, which were then stocked temporarily at the Paris town hall.

Erdogan's AK Party calls for rerun of Istanbul elections,"
ISTANBUL/ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan s AK Party formally requested on Tuesday an annulment and rerun of Istanbul s municipal elections over what it said were irregularities, prompting the main opposition to accuse it of damaging democracy.
Initial results from the March 31 vote showed the main opposition Republican People s Party (CHP) narrowly won control of Turkey s largest city, thereby ending 25 years of control of a key power centre by the AKP and its Islamist predecessors.
The loss of Istanbul, Turkey s financial hub, would be a blow to Erdogan, who campaigned hard ahead of the vote. The post-vote uncertainty has kept financial markets on edge and contributed to a nearly 5 percent slide in the lira.
In the 16 days since the election, the AKP has filed numerous appeals for vote recounts across Istanbul, a city of more than 15 million people. The High Election Board (YSK) has approved some of those objections, ordering partial or full recounts in several districts. Some are still underway.
Submitting his party s appeal for the annulment and renewal of the vote to the YSK on Tuesday, AKP Deputy Chairman Ali Ihsan Yavuz said thousands of votes had been impacted by the irregularities.
""There is clearly an organised unlawfulness, an election fraud here. The only authority that can end this controversy is the YSK,"" Yavuz told reporters in the capital Ankara.
The AKP has already lost control of Ankara and other key cities. Defeat in Istanbul, where Erdogan was mayor in the 1990s, would be an even greater setback to the president.
The AKP urged electoral officials to block the YSK from giving CHP candidate Ekrem Imamoglu his mayoral mandate after the Istanbul recounts are completed and a final result emerges.
CHP spokesman Faik Oztrak branded the AKP appeal for renewed elections as a ""plot"" and called on the YSK to mandate Imamoglu as the elected mayor of the city.
""The authority that will put a stop to this exploitation, who will hand the right the people gave to the person who earned it is the High Election Board,"" Oztrak told reporters.
""If there is security and predictability of the law in this country, then the YSK s decision should already be clear.""
 

SUITCASES OF DOCUMENTS

The AKP s Yavuz said 16,884 votes were marked as either invalid or added to the tallies of other parties in the elections. He said the AKP had submitted three suitcases of documents to the YSK to prove the irregularities.
If the appeal is approved, a second election would take place on June 2. If rejected, the results would be finalised and the CHP s Ekrem Imamoglu would receive his mandate as mayor.
Yavuz said the gap between Imamoglu and his AKP rival, former Turkish prime minister Binali Yildirim, had fallen to 13,900 votes from around 28,000 as a result of the recounts.
If all votes had been recounted across the city the AKP would have won, Yavuz added.
The repeated AKP challenges have fuelled frustration among CHP supporters, which spilled over into football stadiums at the weekend when fans chanted at top Istanbul derby matches for the mayoral mandate to be given to their candidate.
Speaking on Tuesday to supporters chanting ""give Imamoglu the mandate"" in Istanbul, Imamoglu said the AKP actions harmed the credibility of Turkey s democracy.
""To those who said they carried what they call evidence in suitcases, I say: I think you are experiencing an eclipse of reasoning. Stop this, don t harm this nation, these people,"" he said.

East Libyan forces' push for Tripoli stirs foreign divisions,"
TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Qatar called on Tuesday for a blocking of foreign arms supplies to eastern Libyan forces commander Khalifa Haftar, whose push to seize the capital Tripoli is causing rifts around the Gulf and Europe.
Nearly two weeks into its assault, the veteran general s eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) is stuck in the city s southern outskirts battling armed groups loyal to the internationally-recognised Tripoli government.
Yet Tripoli s roughly 2.5 million people were maintaining a semblance of normality - even as the occasional artillery boom echoed across the city.
""We are still carrying on, thank God. What else can we do?"" said Mohamed Taha, 23, in a street where students still packed a nearby school. Cafes and shops also remained open and busy.
Foreign powers are worried but unable to present a united front over the latest flare-up in the cycle of anarchy and warfare that has gripped Libya since dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011.
The conflict has brought a growing humanitarian toll - 174 people, 756 injured and 18,250 displaced according to latest United Nations tallies - and sunk for now an international peace plan.
It threatens to disrupt oil flows, foment migration across the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, and allow jihadists to exploit the chaos.
Qatar said an existing U.N. arms embargo on Libya should be strictly enforced, to prevent Haftar, 75, from receiving arms.
The Benghazi-based Haftar enjoys the backing of Egypt, the United Arab Einmirates and Saudi Arabia, who view him as an anchor to restore stability and combat Islamist militants. Those three nations cut ties with Qatar in 2017, accusing it of support for militants and Iran.
Qatar s Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told Italian daily La Repubblica that a postponed U.N. peace conference should be rescheduled and Haftar s troops forced to withdraw.
The arms embargo must be implemented ""to prevent those countries that have been providing ammunitions and state-of-the-art weapons from continuing to do so,"" he said.
Past U.N. reports say the UAE and Egypt have both supplied Haftar with arms and aircraft, giving him air superiority among Libya s multiple factions. East Libyan authorities say Qatar and Turkey back rival, Islamist-leaning factions in western Libya.
 

UN MAY DEMAND CEASEFIRE

The Gulf diplomatic divisions echo those in Europe, where former colonial ruler Italy and France have sparred over Libya.
Paris has given Haftar support in the past, viewing him as the best bet to end the chaos since a NATO-backed rebellion to end Gaddafi s murderous four-decade rule.
Italy, with considerable oil interests in the OPEC member, supports the Tripoli government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj and was furious with French reluctance to back a recent European Union resolution urging Haftar to halt his advance.
Nevertheless, Serraj has managed to keep the LNA at bay, thanks largely to armed groups who have rushed to aid them from other western Libyan factions.
The U.N. Security Council is considering a British-drafted resolution that would demand a ceasefire and urge all nations with influence over the warring parties to ensure compliance.
The 15-member council has expressed concern but been unable so far to issue a more formal statement, diplomats said, as Russia objected to a reference to the LNA while Washington said it could not agree a text that did not mention Haftar s forces.
Though Haftar presents himself as a champion against what he calls terrorism, opponents cast him as a would-be dictator in the mould of Gaddafi. About 70 people protested against him at the central Algiers Square in Tripoli on Tuesday.
""We are against Haftar and military rule,"" said demonstrator Assam Dirbiq.
Haftar was among officers who helped Gaddafi rise to power in 1969, but fell out with him during a war with Chad in the 1980s. He was taken prisoner by the Chadians, rescued by the CIA, and lived for about 20 years in Virginia before returning in 2011 to join other rebels in the uprising against Gaddafi.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-16-19/news_big_images/487314_45231675.jpg,world,"Nevertheless, Serraj has managed to keep the LNA at bay, thanks largely to armed groups who have rushed to aid them from other western Libyan factions.",neutral
Hundreds of Afghan delegates to meet with Taliban in Doha,"
(AFP) – Afghanistan published Tuesday a lengthy list of delegates who will meet with the Taliban in Doha this week, including government officials, in what could become the highest-level dialogue between the sworn enemies in years.
A massive roster published by the presidential palace comprises 250 names, including President Ashraf Ghani s chief of staff, Abdul Salam Rahimi, as well as his election running mate, Amrullah Saleh, the former head of Afghan intelligence.
Other delegates named on the list come from many walks of Afghan life including youth leaders, tribal elders and -- significantly -- 52 women.
The last time the Taliban met with the Afghan government was at secretive talks in Pakistan in 2015, which were quickly derailed by the news that Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar had died.
The three days of talks in Qatar, scheduled to start Friday, come amid a months-long push led by Washington for peace nearly 18 years after the US invasion, and as fresh violence rips across Afghanistan.
Any contact between the Kabul government and the Taliban is seen as hugely significant, because the insurgents view Ghani as a US stooge and his government as a puppet regime, and have long refused to speak with them directly.
They have insisted that any government officials attending this week s talks will be doing so only in a ""personal capacity"".
The US, which has cited significant progress after holding direct talks with the militants in Doha several times since September, is not expected to attend.
The militants have not announced a final list of who is headed to Doha, and distanced themselves from a report that suggested their delegation might also include women.
The peace process thus far has been widely criticised for a lack of female representation, and US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has pushed for greater inclusivity.
While the Taliban previously met with Afghan representatives and politicians in Moscow in February, those talks did not include members of Ghani s government.
The spokesman for former president Hamid Karzai, who was at the Moscow talks, said Karzai supported the ""intra-Afghan"" conference in Doha but would not be attending.
Kabul has also been left out of the talks with the Khalilzad and the US delegation, prompting concerns the Afghan government is being sidelined in its own peace process and underscoring the importance of this week s meetings in Doha.
This month, the United Nations said it had lifted travel bans for 11 Taliban delegates so they could attend talks.
That list includes Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a co-founder of the Islamist movement and its top political leader, as well as Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, the Taliban s chief negotiator and former deputy minister of foreign affairs.
The Taliban last week announced the start of Operation Fath, this year s spring offensive, and violence has continued apace across Afghanistan despite Khalilzad calling for a ceasefire.

Cheap tactics: BJP virals Abhinandan's fake picture during election,"
(Web Desk) – Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party BJP losing all sense of morality and ethics has resorted to cheap gimmicks to win over voters.
In a recent trick to secure an election win, BJP has made vrial a picture on social media  of the IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthanam, who was captured in the dog fight saga over Pakistani territory by PAF, after India violated Pakistani airspace and tensions mounted between the archrivals this Feb.

The post showcases an Abhinandan twin, wearing the symbolic saffron scarf with BJP’s  symbol ‘lotus,’ implying his vote was for BJP and message on the post reads.
‘Wing Commander Abhinandan ji has openly supported the BJP and even voted to make Modi ji Prime Minister, and he says there is no better Prime Minister than Modi at present, friends make this reach Jihadis and Congressis, you never brought back a jawan alive and today Abhinandan has returned alive and voted for BJP.’
The viral picture itself gives away its falsehood and the Indians are pointing out the deception of the political party.
According to media reports, first and foremost the Indian constitution does not allow serving armed forces personnel to be a part of political campaigns.
‘Under the Air Force Rules, 1969, IAF personnel are not permitted to take part in political activities.’

On closer inspection of the viral picture, one can easily decipher that someone is impersonating Abhinandan.
Despite the doppelganger wearing the handle bar moustache, a clear clue is the mole on the IAF pilot’s chin which is missing from the fibster posing as the pilot.
Secondly, the impersonator himself has a mole under his right eye which is not present on the real Abhinandan’s face. Social media has erupted with Indian citizens themselves exposing the forgery pointing out that this picture is taken in Gujrat while Abhinandan is registered to vote from Tamil Nadu.

Notre-Dame fire in Paris: what we know so far,"
PARIS (AFP) - A fire that spread from the attic of Notre-Dame cathedral on Monday has caused its spire to crash to the ground, and devastated Paris’s historical monument.
This is what we know so far about the violent blaze:

Fire in the attic 


The fire began around 6.50 pm (1650 GMT).
""I was not far away, I saw the smoke. At first I thought it was the Hotel-Dieu (hospital) but then I realised it was the cathedral. When I arrived, ash was beginning to fall,"" said Olivier De Chalus, head volunteer guide of the cathedral.
The cause of the blaze was not immediately known. It spread from the attic, and quickly across a large part of the roof.
The flames devoured the roof’s wooden frame, which is more than 100 metres in length and nicknamed ""the forest"".
An investigation was opened for accidental destruction by fire, Paris prosecutors said.
Investigators were focussed on whether the fire spread from the site of ongoing reconstruction work on the roof of the cathedral, a source close to the investigation said.
Construction workers were spoken to Monday evening by investigators, the department said.

Fire ‘under control’ 


Firefighters announced early Tuesday the fire was ""completely under control"" and ""partially extinguished"". Only ""residual fires"" were still burning.
Around 11.00 pm (2100 GMT), they announced that the structure of the cathedral had been ""saved and preserved"".
From the moment the fire was spotted, a major emergency operation was put in place to contain the blaze.
Four hundred firefighters with 18 fire hoses, some perched on cranes tens of metres off the ground, battled to contain the fire as quickly as possible.
However, using water-bombing aircraft -- as suggested by US President Donald Trump -- was not considered: ""If used, (this) could lead to the collapse of the entire structure of the cathedral,"" France’s civil security service tweeted.

Extent of damage 


At around 7.50 pm (1750 GMT), the cathedral’s spire -- one of Paris’s most famous landmarks at 93 metres high -- collapsed.
Within a few hours, a large part of the roof had been reduced to ashes.
The extent of the damage inside the cathedral was not yet known by around 11.00 pm (2100 GMT).
""The fire affected two-thirds of the roof, which has collapsed, as well as the spire,"" said Paris fire brigade chief Jean-Claude Gallet, adding that the operation was focussed on preserving the rear of the cathedral where the most valuable works are located.
The Holy Crown of Thorns and a sacred tunic worn by 13th-century French king Louis, two irreplaceable artifacts, had been rescued, the cathedral rector Patrick Chauvet said.

‘Years of work’ 

Restoring the building will take ""years of work"", said the newly elected president of the Bishops’ Conference of France, Eric de Moulins-Beaufort.
In response to ""multiple requests"" the Fondation du patrimoine, a hertitage organisation, will Tuesday launch a ""national collection"" for the reconstruction of Notre-Dame, Anne Le Breton, deputy mayor of the French capital’s 4th arrondissement, said in a statement to AFP.
Overnight the Pinault family, one of the richest in France, pledged 100 million euros ($113 million) for Notre-Dame.
French President Emmanuel Macron, who headed to the scene, said a ""national undertaking"" would be launched, and that ""far beyond our borders, we will appeal to the greatest talents... who will contribute, and we will rebuild"". ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-16-19/news_big_images/487245_23209318.jpg,world,"""The fire affected two-thirds of the roof, which has collapsed, as well as the spire,"" said Paris fire brigade chief Jean-Claude Gallet, adding that the operation was focussed on preserving the rear of the cathedral where the most valuable works are located.",neutral
British police arrest 113 climate change activists after London roads blocked,"
LONDON (Reuters) - British police have arrested 113 people after climate change activists blocked some of London’s most famous roads including Oxford Circus, Marble Arch and Waterloo Bridge in an attempt force the government to do more to tackle climate change.

The protests, led by British climate group Extinction Rebellion, brought parts of central London to a standstill on Monday and some stayed overnight for a second day of protest on Tuesday.

Extinction Rebellion, which generated headlines with a semi-nude protest in the House of Commons earlier this month, is demanding the government declare a climate and ecological emergency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025.

“There have been 113 arrests in total, the majority of which are for breach of Section 14 Notice of the Public Order Act 1986 and obstruction of the highway,” London police said.

Tents littered the roads at Oxford Circus with some activists huddled beneath a pink boat with the words “Tell the Truth” across its side. One placard read: “Rebel for Life”.

Police said five of those arrested had been detained after the Shell building near the River Thames was targeted.

Two protesters on Monday scaled up scaffolding writing ‘Shell Knows!’ in red paint on the front of the building and three protesters glued their hands to the revolving doors at the entrance.

"Notre-Dame fire under control, Macron vows to rebuild","
PARIS (AFP) - A raging fire that tore through Notre-Dame Cathedral in central Paris was under control early Tuesday after the blaze brought its towering spire and roof crashing to the ground, wiping out centuries of priceless heritage central to French culture and history.
French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to rebuild the cathedral described as the soul of the nation and expressed relief that ""the worst had been avoided"" in a blaze that had at one point threatened the entire edifice.
Thousands of Parisians and tourists watched in horror from nearby streets cordoned off by the police as flames engulfed the building and officials tried to save as much as they could of the cathedral’s countless treasures, built up over centuries.
The inferno destroyed the roof of the 850-year-old UNESCO world heritage landmark, whose spectacular Gothic spire collapsed as orange flames and clouds of grey smoke billowed into the early evening sky.
Around 400 firefighters battled into the night to control the flames, declaring in the early hours of Tuesday that it was partially extinguished but completely under control, around nine hours after it broke out.
Paris fire brigade chief Jean-Claude Gallet said ""we can consider that the main structure of Notre-Dame has been saved and preserved"" as well as the two bell towers.
But ""the whole of the roof has been devastated... a part of the vault has collapsed, the spire is no more"", fire brigade spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gabriel Plus said.
Laurent Nunez, state secretary at the interior ministry, told reporters early Tuesday that with the immediate ""danger of the fire over,"" the focus would be on assessing the damage to the building’s structure.
Nunez said officials would meet shortly to see if the building was stable enough to allow fire services to go inside.

‘France is Notre Dame’ 


""Notre-Dame survived all the wars, all the bombardments. We never thought it could burn. I feel incredibly sad and empty,"" Stephane Seigneurie, a consultant who joined other shocked onlookers in a solemn rendition of ""Ave Maria"" as they watched the fire from a nearby bridge.
Gasps and cries of ""Oh my god"" erupted around an hour after the fire first broke out when the top portion of the church’s spire came crashing down.
""We have been dealt a knockout blow,"" a stricken-looking Paris Archbishop Michel Aupetit told reporters.
The cause of the blaze was not immediately clear, but the cathedral had been undergoing intense restoration work which the fire service said could be linked to the blaze.
French prosecutors said it was being currently being treated as an accident.
Historians expressed dismay at the collapse of a building that has been a symbol of France for almost a millennium.
""If Paris is the Eiffel Tower then France is Notre Dame. It’s the entire culture, entire history of France incarnated in this monument,"" Bernard Lecomte, a writer and specialist in religious history told BFM TV.
Deputy Paris mayor Emmanuel Gregoire told the channel that workers were scrambling ""to save all the artworks that can be saved.""
Officials later said teams had managed to salvage an unknown quantity of the cultural treasures.

‘Emotion of a nation’ 


Macron cancelled a planned national policy speech on recent ""Yellow Vest"" protests and instead headed to the scene, where he vowed the cathedral would be reborn.
""We will rebuild Notre-Dame because it is what the French expect,"" he said, describing Notre Dame as ""the epicentre of our life"" and the cathedral of ""all the French"", whether religious or not.
France’s billionaire Pinault dynasty immediately pledged 100 million euros for the reconstruction effort.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Notre-Dame cathedral a ""symbol of European culture"" as the blaze raged.
The Vatican on Monday expressed its ""incredulity"" and ""sadness"" over the fire.

‘Water bombers not used’ 


One firefighter was injured in the blaze, the fire brigade said, revising an earlier assessment that the individual was in a serious condition.
US President Donald Trump in a tweet said it was ""horrible"" to watch the fire but caused controversy by offering advice on how to put it out.
""Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!"" he said.
But France’s civil security service, which oversees crisis management in the country, tweeted back at Trump that the use of water-bombing aircraft was not being considered.
""If used, (this) could lead to the collapse of the entire structure of the cathedral,"" it said.

‘Will never be the same’ 


The cathedral is located at the very centre of the French capital and its construction was completed in the mid-12th century after some 200 years of work.
During the French Revolution in the 18th century, the cathedral was vandalised in widespread anti-clerical violence: its spire was dismantled, its treasures plundered and its large statues at the grand entrance doors destroyed.
It would go on to feature as a central character in a Victor Hugo novel published in 1831, ""The Hunchback of Notre-Dame"" and shortly afterwards a restoration project lasting two decades got under way, led by architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc.
The building survived the devastation of two global conflicts in the 20th century and famously rang its bells on August 24, 1944, the day of the Liberation of Paris from German occupation at the end of the World War II.
""Paris is disfigured. The city will never be like it was before,"" said Philippe, a communications worker in his mid-30s.
Jacky Lafortune, a 72-year-old artist and self-described atheist stood forlornly on the banks of the River Seine staring at the burning cathedral.

Yemen parties agree details of pullback plan: UN envoy,"
UNITED NATIONS (AFP) - Yemen s government and Huthi rebels have accepted a detailed plan for a much-delayed pullback from the flashpoint city of Hodeida, the UN envoy said Monday, but no timetable was announced for the withdrawals.
The redeployment of forces was agreed in December under a ceasefire deal reached in Sweden that offered the best hope in years of moving toward an end to the war that has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.
UN envoy Martin Griffiths told the Security Council that ""both parties have now accepted a detailed redeployment plan"" for the first stage of the pullback from Hodeida.
Griffiths said he received assurances from Huthi leader Abdul Malik al Huthi when they met in Sanaa last week that his forces would support the Hodeida agreement, but the envoy sounded a note of caution after so many delays.
""Let us be clear that when -- and I hope it is when and not if -- these redeployments happen, they will be the first voluntary withdrawal of forces in this long conflict,"" he said by videoconference from Amman.
The United Nations announced a deal on the two-stage pullback from Hodeida city and its ports in February, but the redeployment failed to materialize on the ground and the peace effort has since stalled.
The United States put the onus on the Huthis to unblock the process and begin redeployments as agreed in the plan.
""The Yemeni government has demonstarted a clear commitment to the United Nations led process,"" acting US Ambassador Jonathan Cohen told the Security Council.
""It is time for the Huthis to also show the international community that they too are serious about the UN process and the agreements that they themselves reached in Stockholm,"" he said.
The United States, which has supported the Saudi-led coalition backing the government in Yemen s war, also accused the Huthis of blocking access to a food storage site that contains enough grain to feed 3.7 million people for a month.
The Red Sea Mills ""remain closed and the food stocks within may be rotten,"" said Cohen.  ""At this point only the Huthis are blocking access to the Mills and they alone will be to blame if the food spoils.""
The Red Sea port of Hodeida is the entry point for the bulk of imported goods and relief aid to Yemen.
The detailed plan on the pullback was negotiated by Danish General Michael Lollesgaard who heads a UN monitoring mission.
Following the deal on the first stage, Lollesgaard will now focus on the second phase and seek to resolve disputes over the deployment of local forces in areas from where there has been a pullback.
Griffiths said he was laying the groundwork for broader serious negotiations on ending the war in Yemen but added: ""We all need to see tangible progress in Hodeida before moving to focus on the political solution.""
The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 to push back an advance by Huthi rebels who continue to hold the capital Sanaa, and restore Hadi to power.
The conflict has unleashed the world s worst humanitarian conflict, according to the United Nations, with millions facing famine.

MoC stressed to approach SA authorities for waiving anti-dumping duty on cement ,"
KARACHI (Dunya News) – Pakistan-South Africa Business Forum (PSABF) Chairman Mohammad Rafiq Memon has said that Pakistan’s cement exports to South Africa have suffered terribly during the last couple of years because of the anti-dumping duty imposed by the South African government that resulted in shrinking cement export to around US$100 to US$150 million which was around US$700 million prior to imposition of anti-dumping duty. 
“We are trying our best to get this issues resolved but Pakistan’s Ministry of Commerce (MoC) also has to send a delegation to South Africa in order to convince the authorities to review and waive this anti-dumping duty on cement”, he stressed while speaking at a meeting during the visit of South African delegation to Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Chairman PSABF was fairly optimistic that the South African government would review the anti-dumping duty on cement imports and the situation was likely to improve by 2020, provided the Ministry of Commerce takes up this issue with relevant authority in South Africa.
President PSABF (Pakistan Region) Ghulam Muhammad, Senior Vice President KCCI Khurram Shahzad, Vice President KCCI Asif Sheikh Javaid, Members of South African delegation and KCCI’s Managing Committee were also present at the meeting.
While requesting KCCI to participate in the forthcoming events being organised by PSABF in South Africa, he informed that PSABF plans to organise a 4-day seminar in the month of July 2019 which will be followed by a single country exhibition in October 2019 to highlight Pakistan’s trade potential. “Both these events in South Africa will provide a perfect opportunity to industrialists and traders from KCCI to introduce their products and services in South Africa which is a gateway to the entire African region”, he added.
He said that PSABF also plans to establish a trade center in South Africa by December 2019 where Pakistani manufacturers and exporters will be able to display samples of their products and services along with relevant contact information, which would results in effectively promoting Pakistani products not only in the South African market but also other African states.
“As Pakistan’s trade and diplomatic relations have not been so well with South Africa, therefore we are striving really hard to improve ties between the two countries”, he said, adding that potential exists to enhance trade and investment ties in tourism, textile, agriculture, pharmaceutical, mining and construction sectors. “Many South African investors are also interested in Pakistan’s hospitality, tourism and aviation sectors. They also want to establish mini zoos, Safari Parks and resorts in Karachi and Gilgit-Baltistan”, he added.
He mentioned that PSABF, which was formed in 2014, has enhanced its activities and the forum has been regularly holding negotiations with South African government and other stakeholders with a view to enhance trade and investment ties between the two countries. During the past four years, PSABF has received and facilitated 27 delegations from Pakistan and they look forward to receiving a delegation from Karachi Chamber in near future. “PSABF is not just confined to South Africa only but we have expanded our activities to nine more countries in the African region”, he added.
Senior Vice President KCCI Khurram Shahzad, while welcoming the South African delegates, assured to take up the anti-dumping issue being faced by Pakistani cement exporters with Ministry of Commerce so that the government could hold negotiations with relevant authorities in South Africa.
He pointed out that the economic relations between Pakistan and South Africa have remained cordial and it was really heartening to see that eight MoUs were signed during Pakistan-South Africa Joint Commission meeting in 2013 to increase trade value between countries to $1 billion which was finally achieved in 2017.
He said, “Pakistan and South Africa share moderate bilateral trade relations as we exported goods worth $178.15 million in 2018 to South Africa while our imports stood at $1.24 billion.”
Khurram Shahzad was of the opinion that there was a huge potential to enhance bilateral trade relations between Pakistan and South Africa. In this regard, Pakistan can increase its leather footwear exports to South Africa at competitive prices.
“CPEC depicts a great opportunity for Pakistan to further enhance its trade volume to South Africa”, he said, adding that Pakistan can also export meat products to South Africa market, as the country relies significantly on imported meat from Brazil and European countries.
He further stressed that both countries can enhance their mutual cooperation and knowledge transfer in the mining sector. For this purpose, Balochistan province offers a wonderful opportunity for both Pakistani and South-African companies to take different joint ventures.
He emphasised that the Karachi Chamber wants to promote business, mutual understanding and friendly relations between the business communities of Pakistan and South Africa. “We want to promote and do everything for the development of Pakistan–South Africa business cooperation”, he added.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-18-19/news_big_images/487495_20777877.jpg,business,"“We want to promote and do everything for the development of Pakistan–South Africa business cooperation”, he added.",neutral
"ADB releases annual report, financial results for 2018","
ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – The Asian Development Bank (ADB) released its Annual Report for 2018 on Tuesday. 
The report presents ADB’s important operational and organizational milestones over the past year, including key numbers and data of ADB operations, activities, and financial results.
It also focuses on the adoption of ADB’s new long-term corporate strategy, Strategy 2030, approved in July 2018, and highlights the strategic transition in progress across all aspects of ADB’s operations and organization.
The demand for ADB assistance continued to grow in 2018. New commitments included $21.6 billion in loans, grants, and investments from ADB’s own resources, exceeding the target of $19.71 billion and up 10% from 2017.
Private sector operations reached $3.14 billion, a 37% increase from 2017, which is 14.5% of ADB’s overall commitment. The result reflected ADB’s long-term strategy to increase support for private enterprise, especially in new markets and sectors, to create more high-quality jobs and to mobilize private financial resource for development.
ADB also successfully mobilized $14 billion in cofinancing from bilateral and multilateral agencies and other financing partners, including $7.17 billion in co-financing from ADB’s private sector operations. The increase in co-financing saw total new commitments reach $35.82 billion in 2018, a 13% increase over 2017, reflecting the importance of partnerships in addressing Asia and the Pacific’s continuously growing development needs.
Disbursements, a key indicator for successful project implementation, also improved, rising to $14.19 billion in 2018, an increase of 24% from 2017.
In his message to stakeholders in the report, ADB President Takehiko Nakao said that Strategy 2030 had energized ADB and positioned the Manila-based lender well to help countries in Asia and the Pacific cope with the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
“As our region continues to develop and transform, so too must ADB,” said Nakao. “Strategy 2030 provides us with a clear roadmap to meet the needs of our developing member countries (DMCs) and guide our operations for the next decade. We set out clear corporate targets to significantly increase operations, to build climate and disaster resilience, address gender equality, and mobilize long-term private financing.”
ADB continued to deliver on its climate commitments in 2018 with $3.6 billion in financing approved. ADB is on target to double its annual climate financing to $6 billion in approvals by 2020.
ADB also made significant progress in designing projects with a gender focus. In 2018, 47% of ADB’s support, on a three-year-average term, included elements that directly improved the lives of women and girls in the region.
The report also records ADB’s successful efforts to strengthen its role as a leading provider of development knowledge and expertise to DMCs seeking support to implement policies, programs, and projects that utilize international best practices and learnings.

"Gold slips to Rs70,850 per tola ","
KARACHI (Dunya News) – Following decrease in gold rate in international market, the current rate of 24K per tola has reduced by Rs150 to Rs70,850.
Likewise, the gold rate 24K per 10 grams has reduced to Rs60,872 with the decrease of Rs130, whereas the rate of 22K gold per 10 grams has slipped to Rs55,681.
Moreover, the sliver rate sustained at Rs900 per tola.
On Tuesday, gold slipped for a fourth straight as recent upbeat economic data and signs that Washington and Beijing were making headway in a nearly year-long tariff skirmish boosted risk sentiment.
Better economic conditions stoke investors to pivot towards equities that are interest-bearing assets, and shun the non-yielding bullion.
Spot gold was down 0.2 percent at $1,285.39 per ounce, as of 0734 GMT. In the previous session, the bullion dropped to $1,281.96, its weakest since April 4.
U.S. gold futures shed 0.2 percent to $1,288.30 an ounce.
“The main reason what pressures gold is the improved economic data ... for countries such as China for example, things have turned around a fair bit,” said analyst Dominic Schneider of UBS Wealth Management in Hong Kong.
China reported better-than-expected credit and export figures last week that allayed concerns regarding the pace of economic growth.
Jobs data from the United States last week also lifted sentiment, assuaging concerns that the largest economy was losing momentum. Data showed the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a 49-1/2-year low.
Asian stocks were close to a nine-month peak on increasing expectations that the Chinese economy would stabilise.
“Equity markets are trading on an even keel, while optimism about a U.S.-China trade deal continues to be very supportive for risk sentiment completely deflating investor appetite for safe-haven plays like gold,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading and market strategy, SPI Asset Management.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told Fox Business Network on Monday trade negotiations between Washington and its Chinese counterparts were “making a lot of progress”.
Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, on Monday dropped to 754.03 tonnes, their lowest since Nov. 9, 2018.
“The other element that pressures gold is the 10-year (yields) in the U.S., which, despite easing yesterday, has been creeping up a bit from its March lows,” Schneider added.
Markets now await key Eurozone and Chinese data, which will provide further clues on the global economic health.
A Reuters poll has meanwhile suggested that despite China’s first-quarter economic growth likely cooling to the weakest pace in at least 27 years, recent stimulus measures would lift the economic mood in the future.
Among other metals, silver dipped 0.2 percent to $14.97 an ounce, having touching a trough since end-December at $14.81 in the previous session.
Spot platinum gained 0.6 percent to $890.63 per ounce, while palladium rose 0.3 percent to $1,365.05 per ounce.

"Oil extends losses into second session; Russia, OPEC output in focus","
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Oil prices edged down on Tuesday after a Russian minister said the nation and OPEC may boost crude output to fight for market share, checking a recent sharp rally driven by tighter global production.
Brent crude oil futures were at $71.08 a barrel at 0111 GMT, down 10 cents, or 0.1 percent, from their last close. Brent ended down 0.5 percent on Monday.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $63.39 per barrel, down 2 cents, or 0.1 percent, from their previous settlement. WTI fell 0.8 percent on Monday.
Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said over the weekend that Russia and OPEC may decide to boost production to fight for market share with the United States, but this would push oil as low as $40 per barrel.
“There is a growing concern that Russia will not agree on extending production cuts and we could see them officially abandon it in the coming months,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst, OANDA.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, known as OPEC+, will meet in June to decide whether to continue withholding supply. That comes after they previously agreed to crimp output by 1.2 million barrels per day from Jan. 1 for six months.
Losses were checked by tighter supplies from Iran and Venezuela amid signs the United States will further toughen sanctions on those two OPEC producers, and on the threat that renewed fighting could wipe out crude production in Libya.

Gas theft worth Rs48 billion should be stopped: Ghiyas Paracha ,"
KARACHI (Dunya News) – All Pakistan CNG Association (APCNGA) on Monday said the load of Rs65 billion suffered on account of sale of LNG should not be recovered from consumers.
The losses include loss of Rs36 billion in the sale of LNG, Rs26 billion didn’t recovered from the domestic consumers on account of gas supplies from Dec 2018 to Feb 2019 and delayed payments from consumers which added to the bank interest.
Speaking at a public hearing by OGRA in Lahore, the central leader of APCNGA Ghiyas Paracha said that recovery of all the losses from CNG and other sector is unjustified and unacceptable.
He said that gas worth Rs48 billion is being stolen of which 93 percent is stolen in the district of Karak in which gas officials are also involved. If gas utilities accord proper attention to the issue it can be resolved in a few months while we are also ready to cooperate in this regard.
Pointing out the weakness in the gas billing and measurements he said that gas utilities are overcharging consumers on account of GCV and gas mix while there is a lack of check and balance.
Ghiyas Paracha said that SNGPL has demanded Rs723 per mmbtu increase in gas tariff and Rs111 per mmbtu increase in LNG tariff which if accepted will make it very expensive discouraging buyers.
He said that the volume of gas continues to increase but the charges of gas distributors are not decreasing but continue to increase which is against the phenomena.
The leader of the CNG sector said that payment for post terminal expanses like regasification, transportation, and UFG should be made in the rupee and not the dollar.
He hoped that if his suggestions were accepted it will reduce the price of gas instead on an increase.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-15-19/news_big_images/487151_45536097.jpg,business,He hoped that if his suggestions were accepted it will reduce the price of gas instead on an increase.,neutral

"US, Japan kick off trade talks amid China deal optimism","
TOKYO (AFP) - As optimism grows that the United States and China are nearing a trade deal, Japan kicks off its own negotiations with Washington from Monday, hoping to resolve some of the issues ""very quickly.""
US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Japan’s Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi are set to embark on two days of talks in Washington.
In Tokyo last week, Motegi predicted the crunch talks would be ""candid"", with the first round on Monday about ""making a decision on which areas we will discuss, chiefly in the field of goods"".
""I will do my best to have thorough discussions so as to produce a good result in line with our national interest,"" said Motegi.
Self-styled dealmaker Donald Trump has been playing hardball with traditional US trading partners, using tariffs and threats in an effort to boost US exports and curb Washington’s longstanding trade deficit.
In May, Trump ordered his administration to investigate the possibility of imposing tariffs of up to 25 percent on foreign autos and auto parts, a prospect that alarmed the industry and could have serious repercussions for Japan and Europe.
The US president has frequently complained that Japan has an unfair advantage in bilateral trade and vowed to fix that.

‘Very quick agreement’

US Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said Thursday he was seeking a ""very quick agreement"" with Japan on tariff cuts for agricultural goods.
""I hope we can come to a very quick agreement with Japan over maybe some temporary ... provisions and hash out the many other issues that take longer in this area,"" Perdue told reporters in Washington, Kyodo News and the business daily Nikkei reported.
However, the US side is likely to run into opposition from Japan on this issue, Jiji Press reported, citing unnamed government sources.
""There’s no way for us to conclude an agricultural deal first,"" a senior Japanese official told Jiji.
If Japan does so, it may violate World Trade Organization rules related to free-trade agreements, the officials noted, according to the report.
Tokyo is expected to counter with demands that the United States scrap tariffs on Japanese industrial goods, if Washington urges an early opening of Japanese agricultural markets.
Tokyo aims to focus only on tariff matters, describing the talks as ""TAG"" or trade agreement on goods.
However, Washington trade officials have spelled out 22 specific negotiation areas also including non-tariff barriers in Japan’s auto market and currency.
US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Saturday any agreement will include a requirement to refrain from manipulating currencies to gain an advantage in international trade.
Golf buddies Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will have plenty of opportunities to talk trade in the coming months.
Abe is visiting the United States later this month and Trump is expected in Japan in May to pay his respects to the country’s new emperor who will take the throne on May 1.

Facebook has in the past few years faced public outcry over its role in Russia’s alleged influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election and has come under fire following revelations that Cambridge Analytica obtained personal data from millions of Facebook profiles without consent. 
Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg took home $23.7 million in 2018 compared to $25.2 million last year.
Separately, Facebook said Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings would vacate his seat on the social media company’s board and not be nominated for re-election.
Hastings’ departure comes as the Menlo Park-based company beefs up its push into videos. Hastings has served on Facebook’s board since 2011.
The company also said it would nominate PayPal’s senior vice president of core markets, Peggy Alford, to its board in place of University of North Carolina President Emeritus Erskine Bowles, who will also not be re-nominated.

Shamed Bancroft hits 151 on Durham one-day debut,"
LONDON (AFP) - Cameron Bancroft hit an unbeaten 151 on his one-day debut for Durham as the disgraced Australia batsman started to repay the English county s faith in him.
Bancroft was banned for nine months after being caught in the Australia ball-tampering scandal during their tour to South Africa last year
The  sandpaper-gate  incident during the Newlands Test against South Africa also led to Bancroft s Australia team-mates Steve Smith and David Warner receiving year-long suspensions.
After returning in Australia s Big Bash League in December, and playing a role in the back end of Western Australia s current Sheffield Shield campaign, Bancroft has joined up with Durham with a view to making Australia s Ashes squad.
Durham, now under a new Australian director of cricket in Marcus North, attracted criticism in some quarters when they recruited Bancroft.
But the 26-year-old was controversially appointed Durham captain and, making his maiden limited overs appearance, Bancroft piled up the runs in their One-Day Cup clash with Northamptonshire at Chester-le-Street on Wednesday.
Bancroft, who played in the 2017-18 Ashes, plundered five sixes and eight fours in a 188-minute stay at the crease.
He and Michael Richardson put on 208 for the fourth-wicket before the latter was ousted in the final over.
Durham went on to score 342 for five from their 50 overs.

Zimbabwe prevail in rain-affected thriller to seal clean-sweep,"
HARARE (Agencies) - Zimbabwe eased home by three wickets against United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the fourth ODI between the sides at the Harare Sports Club to confirm a series whitewash.
Chasing 176, the hosts initially made excellent progress, racing to 37/0 inside seven overs before rain reduced the target to 128 in 30 overs. After the interval they found progress tougher going, with Brian Chari dismissed for 19 in the ninth over, slashing Mohammad Naveed aerially to Imran Haider at third man.
Naveed dismissed Zimbabwe’s other opener in his very next over, bowling Regis Chakabva with a perfect yorker. Sean Williams and Craig Ervine dragged Zimbabwe to 79/2, but three wickets in four balls gave the tourists the ascendancy. Zahoor Khan nicked off Ervine before Rohan Mustafa bowled each of Williams and new man PJ Moor.
Timycen Maruma’s cameo was crucial. He smashed 35 off 20 balls, at one point hitting Mustafa for two fours and a six in three balls, and then striking Haider for a four and a six in consecutive balls. His dismissal, bowled by Shaiman Anwar, saw Zimbabwe’s nerves resurface, with Ryan Burl and Sikandar Raza scoring one run in eight balls before the former was run out after being sent back. But the damage had been done, and two boundaries in four balls saw them seal a three-wicket win with time to spare.
UAE could take heart from their effort with the ball, but were left too much to do after another lacklustre batting effort. They had been given a strong platform by Chirag Suri and CP Rizwan, who helped them up to 91/2. But each was dismissed short of their half-centuries, and no one was able to provide a final flourish.
Muhammad Usman chipped in with a 24-ball 27, but on the whole Zimbabwe kept things tight, with Williams proving especially economical, rattling through 10 overs to finish with 2/27. UAE’s 175 never looked like enough, and hard though they fought, it proved to be the case.

Archer selection would be morally unfair: Woakes,"
LONDON (AFP) - Jofra Archer may be an exciting prospect, but fast-tracking him into England s provisional World Cup squad on Wednesday would not ""be fair morally"", said fellow paceman Chris Woakes.
Barbados-born Archer -- described by England all-rounder Ben Stokes as the most ""naturally-gifted"" bowler he has seen -- became eligible for England earlier this year.
The 24-year-old Sussex bowler -- whose father is English -- was the only high-level player to benefit when the England and Wales Cricket Board decided in November to alter residency rules.
Previously, players who entered the UK after turning 18 needed to live in the country for seven years to be eligible for England, but the ECB reduced that to three years. Archer arrived in 2015.
Woakes told BBC Sport that England, the top-ranked one-day-international team, have become close under captain Eoin Morgan as they prepared for the World Cup which gets underway in England at the end of May.
""It probably wouldn t be fair, morally, but at the same time it s the nature of international sport,"" said Woakes.
""If he was to come in and someone was to miss out, it would be extremely unfortunate.
""We ve been a tight-knit group for the last two to three years, played some really strong cricket, won a lot of series.
""I wouldn t want to see any of my mates and team-mates miss out.""
But the all-rounder insisted that England would remain focused on the job at hand should Archer get a call-up.
""I don t think it would disrupt the team, because everyone would find a way to move on and we re trying to win a World Cup for England. That s the bigger picture,"" added the 30-year-old.
Archer, who is playing in the IPL for the Rajasthan Royals, has appeared in just 14 one-day matches as a professional, but England coach Trevor Bayliss has said the all-rounder will feature in the ODIs against Ireland and Pakistan in May.
Other England pace bowlers have also expressed doubts.
David Willey said in March he did not know ""whether someone should just walk in at the drop of a hat because they re available"".
Mark Wood said last week that selecting Archer risked changing the ""dynamic"" of the side.

Pak woman cricketer Diana ruled out of South Africa tour,"
LAHORE (APP) – Seventeen-year-old pace bowler Fatima Sana has been included in Pakistan women team that will tour South Africa in place of pace bowler Diana Baig, who underwent a surgery on her injured left thumb on Tuesday.
Diana has been advised eight to ten weeks rest following the surgery at Karachi and she has been ruled out of Pakistan’s tour of South Africa that begins from Monday, 29 April. Diana got injured during a training session in Karachi on Monday, where the South Africa bound squad is preparing for the tour.
Chief selector Pakistan women team Urooj Mumtaz on Tuesday expressed her disappointment at Diana’s injury she added that the tour of South Africa provides a good opportunity for Fatima to prove her worth.
“It was unfortunate that Diana fractured her left thumb during practice yesterday. Thankfully the surgery was a success and I wish her a speedy recovery. Diana has been replaced by Fatima Sana, a young promising fast bowler and I wish her all the best,” she said.
Fatima took seven wickets in as many games in the recently concluded 2nd Inter-Departmental T20 Women’s Cricket Championship 2019 that was held in Islamabad.
Hyderabad-born Fatima represented ZTBL in the tournament. Diana will now undergo a rehabilitation programme under the supervision of National Cricket Academy’s medical panel.
Pakistan team will leave for South Africa on 29 April. The team will play a series of three ODIs (part of the ICC Women’s Championship), five T20’s and two warm-up games in their 25-day tour.

"Uncapped Jayed, recalled Mosaddek in Bangladesh World Cup squad","
DHAKA (Reuters) - Rookie swing bowler Abu Jayed earned a spot in Bangladesh’s World Cup squad on Tuesday while batsman Mosaddek Hossain also made the cut for the showpiece tournament in England and Wales.
Right-arm paceman Jayed, who has played five tests but has yet to debut in ODIs, was picked for his ability to swing the ball as he demonstrated in the two-test series in New Zealand.
“In New Zealand, we saw that he could swing the ball. His bowling can be effective in English conditions,” chief selector Minhajul Abedin told reporters in Mirpur after naming the 15-member squad led by all-rounder Mashrafe Mortaza.
Jayed’s selection came at the expense of fellow paceman Taskin Ahmed, who missed the Zealand tour with an ankle injury. “Taskin played his last ODI in October 2017 and it’s been a long break for him,” Minhajul said.
Mosaddek, who last played for Bangladesh in the Asia Cup in September, returned as a back-up all-round option as Mahmudullah nurses a shoulder injury. “We have some injury concerns for Mahmudullah. Most probably he will not be able to bowl. That’s why we have considered Mosaddek as a back-up,” Minhajul said. “He can bowl off-spin which can be a great asset for us in an event like World Cup.”
Apart from Mahmudullah, the pace duo of Mustafizur Rahman and Rubel Hossain were also named in the squad despite injury concerns. Mustafizur has not fully recovered from an ankle problem, while Rubel is nursing a side strain.
All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan has been named Mortaza’s deputy while Mushfiqur Rahim is the wicketkeeper. Bangladesh begin their campaign against South Africa at the Oval in London on June 2. New Zealand, Australia and India have already announced their squads and others must follow suit by April 23. Injury replacements can be named until May 23.
Squad: Mashrafe Mortaza (captain), Tamim Iqbal, Liton Das, Soumya Sarkar, Mushfiqur Rahim (wicketkeeper), Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan (vice captain), Mohammad Mithun, Sabbir Rahaman, Mosaddek Hossain, Mohammad Saifuddin, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Rubel Hossain, Mustafizur Rahman, Abu Jayed

India's Shankar seeks guidance from World Cup winners at Sunrisers,"
(Reuters) - All-rounder Vijay Shankar is making the most of his presence in a Sunrisers Hyderabad camp which also contains a couple of World Cup winners after being selected in India’s 15-member squad for the showpiece tournament in England and Wales.
The Tamil Nadu all-rounder was picked on Monday as India’s number four batsman whose seam bowling expertise could also be useful in English conditions.
“We have a few World Cup winning team members here at Sunrisers Hyderabad and I have spoken to them to understand what it feels like to play in a World Cup and then go on to win it,” Shankar said in a Hyderabad news release.
The Indian Premier League (IPL) side have opening batsman David Warner and coach Tom Moody who have both won the World Cup with Australia.
“I have learnt a lot from them on the ways to manage pressure at such a large scale event,” Shankar said. “I’m extremely elated to be in the Indian World Cup team, this is like a dream come true.”
Hyderabad team mate Bhuvneshwar Kumar has also been selected and the 29-year-old medium pacer, known for his ability to swing the ball both ways, hopes to thrive in English conditions.
“The conducive English conditions will suit my strength and I’m looking to make the most of it,” Kumar said. “This is my second World Cup and now I’m pretty confident to perform at such a level.
“Playing for Sunrisers in the IPL has given me the right match practice just before the mega tournament.”
India, who won the World Cup in 1983 and 2011, begin their campaign against South Africa in Southampton on June 5.

Pakistan appoints Rohail Nazir U19 captain for Sri Lanka tour,"
LAHORE (Web Desk) – Rohail Nazir, who scored a century on his first-class debut this season, has been appointed as Pakistan U19 captain for next month’s series against Sri Lanka, the Pakistan Cricket Board announced today.
Wicketkeeper/batsman Rohail scored 130 and four for Islamabad against Habib Bank Limited in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy in September. He played three more first-class matches in his debut season and finished with 300 runs besides dismissing 13 batsmen behind the wickets.
Rohail was Hassan Khan’s vice-captain in the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup 2018 in New Zealand where Pakistan finished third after their third-fourth place play-off against Afghanistan was abandoned without a ball being bowled. Rohail finished the tournament with 140 runs and 14 dismissals, and later went on to captain Pakistan U19 in the ACC U19 Asia Cup in September/October 2018.
Mohammad Taha, who was also part of the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup 2018 squad, has been appointed as vice-captain. Taha, a left-handed top-order batsman, scored 54 runs in five matches in New Zealand and is yet to make his first-class debut.
Faisalabad’s wrist spinner Suleman Shafqat is the other member from the World Cup squad to retain a place in the Sri Lanka touring party. He took three wickets in New Zealand.
Apart from Rohail, the only other first-class cricketer in the 15-player squad is FATA’s fast bowler Abbas Afridi, who has played two matches and taken four wickets.
Saim Ayub is the other notable cricketer to find a place in the side. The left-hander had previously captained Pakistan U16 on the tour to Australia in April 2018 and was also part of the side that featured in the ACC U19 Asia Cup last year in Bangladesh.
Keeping in mind the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup 2020 in South Africa, the junior selection committee headed by Basit Ali has selected players who were born on or after 1 September 2000 so that they remain eligible for next year’s global event to be played from 17 January to 9 February 2020.
Pakistan U19 will play two four-day matches against Sri Lanka U19 in Galle (3-6 May) and Hambantota (9-12 May), before taking on Sri Lanka U19 in three 50-over matches in Hambantota (15 and 17 May) and Galle (20 May).

PCB partners with British Asian Trust to transform mental health in Pakistan,"
LAHORE (Web Desk) – The Pakistan Cricket Board, as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility, today announced a three-year partnership with the prestigious British Asian Trust with an aim to further strengthen support for their mental health programme in Pakistan.
In doing so, the Pakistan cricket team has become the first cricket team to partner with a charity in this way, therefore, showcasing a new way of giving back and making a difference.
The British Asian Trust has been supporting mental health programmes in Pakistan since 2011 and scaled up this work substantially in 2018. It helps to transform the situation for people with mental health issues in Pakistan, working with local partners to develop services, train specialists, reduce stigma and change public perceptions.
According to the World Health Organisation statistics, one in four people will be affected by mental health disorders in their lifetime – accounting for more than 50 million people in Pakistan. Yet, there are fewer than 400 psychiatrists and 500 psychologists in the country to support them as well as widespread stigma attached to speaking openly about personal mental health and wellbeing.
PCB Managing Director, Wasim Khan, said: “We are delighted to be partnering with the British Asian Trust in what will be a ground breaking partnership.
“Driven by our values, we believe cricket has a huge role to play as both a catalyst for change and as a force for good. The work of the British Asian Trust within Pakistan has made a huge difference in supporting mental health and wellbeing amongst some of our most vulnerable people.”
The partnership will shine a light on the issue of mental health in Pakistan, helping people understand there are services available to support individuals and families, and encouraging them to speak out and seek help.
The Pakistan cricket players and staff will also visit local projects in Pakistan so they can find out about the work being done in country as well as meeting with individuals and families affected by mental health issues.
The British Asian Trust galvanises the commitment and passion of the Pakistani diaspora to support their programmes in mental health, education and livelihoods. They have major projects working to provide jobs for women and young people.
The British Asian Trust works with the government, civil society and the private sector and invests in the best local partners to create lasting, meaningful change. Their work is spearheaded by an in-country team and is guided by the strategic insights and expertise of the Pakistan Advisory Council.
Mr Wasim Khan added: “Mental health remains a taboo subject in Pakistan; having personally visited a mental health project in a poor area in Karachi, I have seen first-hand the difference that resources and skilled practitioners can make on the ground.
“As the PCB, we have an opportunity to play our part in raising awareness of this important cause. The lack of education and understanding means that the condition goes undetected; which can have a devastating impact on the quality of life for both the individuals and their families.
“Like many countries, the taboo surrounding mental health problems means that hundreds of thousands of citizens don’t receive treatment, or any kind of support. We as the PCB believe it is important that we use our standing in Pakistan society to stand up and encourage people to seek help.
“The funds raised at the dinner in London on 25 April will be spent on helping to build and expand on the great work already being done in places like Karachi.
“We look forward to building on this work for years to come.”

'Mix and match' - Australia to rotate openers after Warner return,"
SYDNEY (AFP) – Australian coach Justin Langer on Tuesday welcomed the top-order selection dilemma posed by the return of David Warner as offering ""fantastic flexibility"" to the team ahead of the World Cup.
The return of Steve Smith and Warner from their year-long bans for ball-tampering has left selectors in a quandary, with openers Aaron Finch and Usman Khawaja building a formidable partnership in recent one-day internationals.
Warner has been in blistering touch in the Indian Premier League and typically opens the batting.
But Langer on Tuesday said it was a welcome problem to have all three potential openers firing.
""We have amazing flexibility now,"" he told Melbourne radio SEN.
""Usman and Finchy have done an incredible job opening the batting. David and Finchy have done a great job in the past doing it,"" he added.
Langer said he would ""mix and match"" the top order in matches leading up to the World Cup.
""I love the flexibility of it. (It’s about) boys playing their roles for the team not just playing the roles that suit them,"" he said.
Australia named their World Cup squad on Monday with middle order batsman Peter Handscomb ""brutally unlucky"" to have to make way for Smith.
""Steve Smith we felt would probably be able to play that role that Pete has done so well for us,"" Langer said.
The decision to drop Handscomb also means the team only has one wicketkeeper in Alex Carey.

Ex-cricketer Lewis on long walk back from disgrace to redemption,"
BASINGSTOKE (AFP) - Chris Lewis s journey from opening the bowling for England in the 1992 World Cup final to contemplating suicide and being convicted of drugs smuggling has him feeling as ambitious as when he was a teenager, he has told AFP.
The 51-year-old -- who represented England over 80 times in Tests and one-day internationals -- said it was fear over being penniless that drove him to smuggle 140,000 pound ($183,000) of cocaine in cans of fruit into England from St Lucia in 2008.
He stood to earn 50,000 pound from the deal -- instead he ended up serving six and a half years of a 13-year prison term.
The engaging and lithe former all-rounder is presently touring with the play written by Dougie Blaxland (the pen name of former cricketer James Graham-Brown) about his life called ""A Long Walk Back"".
""Do you know, the funny thing is I would suggest I am more ambitious and more optimistic than I have ever been in my life,"" Lewis told AFP in an interview conducted at the Haymarket Theatre in Basingstoke.
""This is a stage of my life I should have gone through in my 20s with a whole set of new experiences.
""It is a place I have not been since I was a teenager... a place when that teenage boy was dreaming of being a cricketer.""
The play, directed by Australian husband and wife Shane Morgan and Moira Hunt of the Bristol-based Roughhouse Theatre, has helped re-light the fire within him.
""It (the play) all comes together from an idea of how we have reached here when less than a decade ago I was sat in a prison cell and my life was more than over,"" Lewis said.
It is a far cry from when Lewis, whose long-term girlfriend Patricia stayed loyal despite him putting her  through the wars , contemplated taking his own life on the first night he was incarcerated after his arrest.
""You cannot get over the prospect of facing a sentence of 15 years,"" he said. ""If you have not been in jail it seems an unimaginable amount of time.
""The question of  if this goes the wrong way what will you do  and (suicide) was certainly something on the table.
""It is ironic that after being sentenced to 13 years that did not occur to me.""
Lewis, whose morale was greatly helped by former Surrey team-mate Jason Ratcliffe who offered him help from the start, largely kept himself to himself in prison.
""A strange thing that happened was sitting on my bed the night after the sentence had been passed and I cried and it got a lot of emotions out,"" he said.
""After I had done crying that night I had no need to cry again.
""In terms of the cell... let us say if you like the fragrance of someone else - the toilet is right next to the bed - there are some people who may put up with that because they want company.
""I was more the other way I wanted to be on my own having some control of one s environment and keep your room a certain way.""
There were certain rules that Lewis imposed on himself from the start of his jail term -- neither listening to music nor telling his adored grandmother Eunice Joseph back in Guyana about his fall from grace.
""I stopped listening to music immediately because a certain tune can take you back to a particular moment,"" he said.
""My mum (Patricia) and aunts took the decision not to tell my grandmother who was very proud of me and I wholeheartedly agreed with it.
""I would ring her from prison and ensured every Christmas that one of my brothers would send her money from me so she would think everything was normal.
""Sadly she was pretty sick at the time, bedridden, and died while I was inside,"" he says, his voice choking with emotion.
In the play, Lewis takes part in a question and answer session with the audience, fielding sometimes awkward enquiries.
He says he is pleased by the play -- which has included two prisons on its tour -- because it explores the emotional side of his story and the battle he had to accept who was to blame for his predicament.
""It was not immediate but eventually I came to the conclusion the person who has the final say in stuff that happened in your life is me.
""It is hard then to start to point the finger without pointing it backwards.""

Poor form puts Amla's World Cup place in jeopardy,"
JOHANNESBURG (AFP) - South Africa s selectors will reveal on Thursday whether veteran batsman Hashim Amla will be part of the country s squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.
Amla, 36, is one of South Africa s all-time great one-day international players but his recent form has been poor, while increasing age has meant that he has slowed down in the field.
Amla scored only 51 runs in four innings in South Africa s shock Test series loss against Sri Lanka earlier this year and did not play in the first three one-day internationals against the tourists, although Cricket South Africa stressed he had not been dropped.
He was due to play the final two one-day games against Sri Lanka but withdrew because his father was seriously ill.
After more than a month out of cricket, Amla returned for the Cape Cobras franchise in a domestic Twenty20 competition in early April but his first three matches yielded only 28 runs.
He showed signs of promise for the Cobras on Sunday with an innings of 32 -- his joint-highest score in any form of cricket since a one-day series against Pakistan in January.
With captain Faf du Plessis, Quinton de Kock, Rassie van der Dussen, David Miller and JP Duminy all seemingly certain of selection, there is probably room for only two more top-order batsmen in a 15-man squad.
Amla s rivals, Aiden Markram and Reeza Hendricks, have both been in good recent form, with Hendricks named man-of-the-series in the recent Twenty20 series against Sri Lanka after a poor one-day series had seemingly scuttled his chances.
Markram and Hendricks are outstanding fielders.
The other big debate ahead of the squad announcement is the identity of a back-up fast bowler to the likely trio of Kagiso Rabada, Dale Steyn and Lungi Ngidi.
Newcomer Anrich Nortje was impressive in the one-day series against Sri Lanka and although he was forced to withdraw from the Indian Premier League with a shoulder injury he is expected to be fit for the World Cup.
While he has not played in a one-day international since February last year, Chris Morris has been picked by several experts in their preferred World Cup squads because he can bowl at more than 140 kph and is a hard-hitting lower-order batsman.
Three wickets for the Delhi Capitals against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Sunday took his total to 11 in six matches in this year s IPL.
Andile Phehlukwayo and Dwaine Pretorius are likely to be picked as all-rounders, while Imran Tahir and Tabraiz Shamsi are South Africa s probable spin bowlers.
It is unlikely that a back-up wicketkeeper to De Kock will be chosen, with Miller seemingly being groomed as an emergency gloveman.

Bangladesh hit by injuries ahead of World Cup,"
DHAKA (AFP) - Bangladesh s hopes for the cricket World Cup have been hit by injuries to several key players, including star pace bowler Mustafizur Rahman.
The 23-year-old left arm bowler sprained his ankle warming up for a Dhaka Premier League match on Thursday, joining a growing injury list which includes batsman Mahmudullah Riyad and pace bowler Rubel Hossain.
Bangladesh had previously barred the injury-prone Mustafizur from playing in the Indian Premier League ahead of the World Cup, which starts May 30. It had let him take part in the domestic 50-over league to keep match-fit however.
The new injury is expected to sideline him for at least two weeks.
""Mustafizur is slightly better now. We are hopeful he will play the World Cup,"" Bangladesh Cricket Board chief physician Debashis Chowdhury told AFP.
Debashis is being kept busy by the squad.
Mahmudullah aggravated a shoulder injury during a recent tour of New Zealand and only returned to tentative training last week.
Rubel Hossain has been suffering from a side strain.
""We hope to start his training session within a day or two,"" said Debashis.
Wicketkeeper-batsman Mushfiqur Rahim, who missed the two Tests in New Zealand started individual training last week while batsman Tamim Iqbal was expected to resume in the upcoming days.
Pace bowler Taskin Ahmed, who was in superb form before a ligament injury ruled out him of the New Zealand tour, played one domestic league game last week.
Off-spinner Mehidy Hasan hurt his thumb in a league game last week but returned to action on Monday.
However, Debashis was hopeful all of the squad would be match-fit for the tournament.
""With the amount of time we have and the current improvement rate of the players, I don t think any one will miss the World Cup,"" he said.
Bangladesh still face a race against time however as they are to play a tri-nation one-day international tournament in Ireland from May 5 against Ireland and the West Indies.
""We hope we can field all our regular players in the tri-nation and World Cup. We hope to announce the squad in a day or two,"" said chief selector Minhajul Abedin.
The deadline for announcing World Cup squads is April 23, but teams can be changed up to May 23.

Bangladesh to call Shakib back from IPL for World Cup camp,"
DHAKA (AFP) - Bangladesh will ask star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan to return from Indian Premier League and join the team s World Cup preparation camp next week, the nation s Cricket Board said Monday.
Shakib is currently in India with his IPL franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad.
""Our camp is beginning. I have asked to send a letter to Shakib immediately to come back. Let s see how he responds to this,"" said Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hassan in Dhaka.
Shakib played just one game this season, picking up one wicket for 42 runs in 3.4 overs against his former franchise Kolkata Night Riders.
It was the only competitive game for Shakib since returning from an injury he picked up during the Bangladesh Premier League final in January.
In a star-studded line-up featuring Australia s David Warner, England s Jonny Bairstow, New Zealand s Kane Williamson, and Afghanistan duo Rashid Khan and Mohammad Nabi, Bangladesh is concerned Shakib might not get more matches in the coming days.
Unable to get enough games, Shakib recently invited his personal coach Mohammad Salahuddin to India in order to keep him ready for the World Cup.
Bangladesh will start their preparation camp for the tournament on April 22 and the team will leave for the UK in early May. They are scheduled to play a tri-nation tournament in Ireland from May 5-17.
The World Cup will be held in the UK from May 30 to July 14 with Bangladesh starting their campaign against South Africa at the Oval on June 2.

"Smith, Warner return for Australia's World Cup defence","
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The return of Steve Smith and David Warner to Australia’s squad for the Cricket World Cup came as little surprise on Monday but selectors still managed to cause a stir by omitting strike bowler Josh Hazlewood and in-form batsman Peter Handscomb.
Former skipper Smith and Warner were eligible for Aaron Finch’s side after their 12-month ball-tampering bans ended last month but their return put a squeeze on the batting positions that saw Handscomb drop out.
“Steve Smith and David Warner come back into the squad. Both are world class players and it has been pleasing to see them produce some good form in the IPL (Indian Premier League),” Chairman of Selectors Trevor Hohns said in a Cricket Australia statement.
Warner has registered five 50-plus scores, including an unbeaten century, for Sunrisers Hyderabad in seven IPL matches this season while Smith, returning from an elbow surgery like his former deputy, has also looked in good touch for Rajasthan Royals.
Spinners Nathan Lyon and Adam Zampa have made the cut, with selectors going for the pace of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Jhye Richardson and Jason Behrendorff, who has been in fine form in the IPL.
Hohns said Hazlewood, who has instead been named in the Australia A team for their tour of England in June-July, remained a big part of Australia’s Ashes plans.
The quick, who has taken 72 wickets in 44 one-dayers, has been sidelined since January due to a back injury but had been confident of being fit for the World Cup.
“Having not played at the highest level for some time, we feel this will provide him with the best preparation to get some quality cricket under his belt,” Hohns said.
“Our focus is to have Josh back bowling at his best for the commencement of a big Ashes tour.”
Starc and Richardson have both been selected subject to fitness.
“The advice from the CA medical team is they are progressing well and barring any setbacks will be available for selection ahead of our opening match against Afghanistan on June 1,” Hohns said.
Teams have to submit their 15-member squads by April 23 but injury replacements can be named until May 23.
Opener Usman Khawaja, player-of-the-series in Australia’s ODI series victory in India last month, was picked but may have to bat lower with Warner likely to partner Finch at the top.
Handscomb was left out despite his good form and the value he adds as a back-up stumper. Alex Carey has been named the sole wicketkeeper in the squad, which also contains all-rounders Marcus Stoinis and Glenn Maxwell.
The tournament, being hosted in England and Wales, runs from May 30 to July 14.
Squad: Aaron Finch (captain), Usman Khawaja, David Warner, Steve Smith, Shaun Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Jhye Richardson, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Jason Behrendorff, Nathan Lyon, Adam Zampa.

South Africa's Tahir tames dangerman Russell in vintage display,"
 NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Imran Tahir proved there is merit to the cricket adage that spinners get better with age after the South African claimed 4-27 in Chennai Super Kings’ five-wicket victory over Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Sunday.
The 40-year-old, who is set to shoulder South Africa’s spin duties in his final World Cup this year, helped Chennai to their seventh win in eight matches, tightening their grip on top spot on the IPL leaderboard.
The leg-spinner ended opener Chris Lynn’s 82-run blitz and dealt an even bigger blow to Kolkata’s hopes when he dismissed Andre Russell, who leads the IPL six-hitters’ list and has plundered 312 runs from seven innings with a 213-plus strike rate.
Having sent back Nitish Rana and Robin Uthappa in the space of three balls, Tahir returned to begin his eventful third over with a wide delivery at Kolkata’s Eden Gardens.
He sent back Lynn with his first legitimate delivery of that over but in walked Jamaican Russell, who hit the first ball he faced from Tahir for a four, defended the next, and then sent the following one sailing over the long-on ropes.
Tahir exacted revenge with the very next delivery, a flatter ball that Russell hit to substitute fielder Dhruv Shorey at long-on.
“I could’ve bowled one or two dot balls or may have conceded one (run) but I wanted to take the challenge,” the Pakistan-born spinner said after claiming his best IPL figures which also earned him the player-of-the-match award.
“I wanted to get him out, it’s as simple as that. He hit me for a six and a four which was fine but I got his wicket which was very important for the team, more than personal achievement. “He’s such a good player, especially in the death overs.”
While Tahir will play in one last World Cup he has no intention of retiring from the game just yet. “I don’t want to retire. I love the game, I have respect for the game and passion for the game,” he said. “(But) there is no other World Cup for me.”

India pick Karthik over Pant in World Cup squad,"
MUMBAI (AFP) - India Monday named a tried and tested squad for the World Cup led by Virat Kohli with selectors going for experience in all the slots with no certain candidate.
Dinesh Karthik, 33, was given the second wicketkeeper’s slot over rising 21-year-old star Rishabh Pant.
Karthik’s form has been indifferent in recent games, but selectors valued his performance under pressure over the years.
""We went ahead with Karthik because of his experience in big matches. We have seen Karthik finishing matches under pressure,"" chief selector M.S.K. Prasad told a news conference.
""Pant is full of talent, he has time on his hands. Unfortunately he missed out.""
Former India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, 37, is first-choice wicketkeeper.
Allrounder Vijay Shankar, who made his one-day debut this year, was also named for the tournament which starts in England and Wales on May 30. He will probably be the number four batsman, which had been another gap in the 15-member squad.

Pictures and podcasts: royal fans old and new await Baby Sussex,"
(REUTERS) - In Ryan Hatrick s London kitchen, Prince William and his wife Kate smile from lined up royal-themed mugs, a magnet of Queen Elizabeth sticks to the oven, and a tea towel marking Prince Harry s wedding to Meghan Markle hangs nearby.
Books about the British royal family lie on the table around which the 41-year-old s labrador, named Windsor, plays with his favourite toy - a squeaky crown.
Hatrick has long been a royal fan - he remembers his mother looking for somewhere to watch Prince Charles marry Diana Spencer while on holiday in a remote seaside cottage in 1981 and avidly read about Tudor monarchs as a teenager.
""I think in a day when we are just being inundated with depressing news...the royals have given us something to look forward to,"" he said.
Hatrick, who works in security, has hosted royal-themed parties: last May he decorated a pub with balloons and bunting and ordered a cake to celebrate Harry marrying American actress Meghan in a televised wedding watched by millions.
From Boston to Karachi, Britain s royal family draws fans around the world, eagerly following special occasions, their outings, and in the cases of Kate and Meghan, their outfits.
They collect memorabilia, travel to see the royals in public or follow their news from afar. In an age of social media, new types of fans have created Facebook pages, Instagram accounts and broadcast podcasts to global audiences.
When Harry and Meghan, who are expecting their first child, launched their @sussexroyal Instagram handle on April 2, the account broke the record for the fastest time to get one million followers on the platform, hitting the number in five hours and 45 minutes, according to Guinness World Records.
""People are always interested in the news and the fact that Harry and Meghan are going to have a baby...will be of passing interest to most people,"" royal commentator Claudia Joseph said.
""But of course there are royal watchers who are fascinated and other people who just shrug their shoulders in the pub.""
William, Kate and their children, Harry and Meghan, have particularly generated social media buzz. Websites, blogs and Instagram accounts have sprouted in their honour.
""The reason behind posting is...I love her a lot,"" said Karachi-based Mah Jabeen, 36, ""Meghan Markle"" fan Facebook page and YouTube channel about the now duchess.
In Amman, Ala Mashharawi, content and social media editor at news website Al Bawaba, follows Kate and Meghan news, but his @meghanmarkle_arabic Instagram account focuses on the latter.
""What inspired me was her style, I just wanted to keep a personal library of...everything that Meghan wore; then one thing lead to another, people started to like the page and following and asking for news"", the 28-year-old said.
Other fans want to shine a light on royal work. Boston-based Denese Carpenter started the ""My Duke and I"" podcast with her partner to discuss Harry and Meghan s work relating to the Commonwealth: he is Youth Ambassador while she patron of The Association of Commonwealth Universities.
""Not only am I a fan of Meghan and Harry but I ve taken it a step further in creating a podcast with my partner to shed a light on the importance of what they re doing as youth ambassadors to the 53 Commonwealth countries"", she said.
British retiree Margaret Tyler has garnered her own press attention for her royal dedication. Her London home is filled with plates, cups, pictures, dolls and life-size cardboard cut-outs of the queen and other royals.

'Avengers: Endgame' movie directors plead: 'Don't spoil it',"
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The directors of “Avengers: Endgame” pleaded with fans on Tuesday not to spoil the movie by giving away storylines after reports that some scenes had leaked online.

In an open letter posted on Twitter under the hashtag #DontSpoilTheEndgame, Joe and Anthony Russo said they and the vast cast of the upcoming Marvel superhero movie “have worked tirelessly for the last three years with the sole intention of delivering a surprising and emotionally powerful conclusion” to the saga.

“When you see Endgame in coming weeks, please don’t spoil it for others, the same way you wouldn’t want it spoiled for you,” they added.

Walt Disney Co’s “Avengers: Endgame” marks the conclusion of a story told across 22 Marvel films. The plot has been shrouded in secrecy, with no advance screenings for the entertainment press. Sales of advance tickets earlier this month surpassed those of 2015 movie “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

The film, which brings together multiple comic book characters, starts its rollout on April 24 in Australia and China before arriving in the United States on April 25.

Some fans said on Tuesday they had seen brief, grainy scenes on Reddit, YouTube and other platforms, but the footage was swiftly removed. Reuters has not seen the leaked scenes and Disney declined to comment.

The #DontSpoilTheEnding hashtag was one of the top Twitter trends on Tuesday. Some fans who said they had viewed the leaks said they only increased their anticipation for the movie.

According to media reports, the actor’s sentimental connection to the pre-partition love story was due to his father Sunil Dutt, whose real name was Balraj which happens to be his character’s name in the movie, moreover his father also came from Pakistan during partition so his link to the flick is of an emotional nature.
‘During the shoot of Gumrah, Yash uncle had briefly mentioned about the story. Dharma Productions is like family; so when Karan approached me with the film, I had to do it. It is also a coincidence that my character is named Balraj, which is my father s [Sunil Dutt] real name. He too came from Pakistan during Partition, so it has an emotional connect,’ he added.

Record 17.4 million watch 'Game of Thrones' kickoff for final season,"
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Some 17.4 million Americans watched the first episode of the final season of television’s “Game of Thrones” - a record audience for the mediaeval fantasy series, cable channel HBO said on Monday.

HBO said Sunday’s live U.S. television audience and viewers on its HBO GO and HBO NOW apps exceeded the previous series high of 16.9 million viewers for the Season 7 finale two years ago.

On social media, Sunday’s premiere was also the most-tweeted-about episode of the show ever, with more than 5 million Tweets, and 11 million mentions throughout the course of the weekend, HBO said in a statement.

All of the top 10 global Twitter trends late Sunday evening were about the episode.

The series set among warring families in the fictional kingdom of Westeros, which began in 2007, has become HBO’s biggest hit.

Season 7 averaged 32.8 million U.S. viewers per episode when delayed viewing was counted and HBO said it expected the Season 8 average to “grow considerably”.

“Game of Thrones” is available in over 150 countries worldwide, but HBO said viewing data is not easily retrieved in many of those markets, making a global figure impossible to calculate.

Details of the final season have been kept a closely guarded secret, boosting anticipation.

The most-tweeted moment from Sunday’s show came when popular “Thrones” character Jon Snow (played by Kit Harington) learned the truth about his parents, and the fact that his love interest, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), is in fact his aunt.

Despite its avid fan base, “Game of Thrones” is far from the biggest television event in the United States. The annual NFL Super Bowl attracts about 100 million viewers and the 2019 Oscars ceremony in February was watched on television by 29.6 million Americans.

The final episode of “Game of Thrones” will air on May 19. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-16-19/news_big_images/487199_57554786.jpg,entertainment,HBO said Sunday’s live U.S. television audience and viewers on its HBO GO and HBO NOW apps exceeded the previous series high of 16.9 million viewers for the Season 7 finale two years ago.,neutral
Actress Loughlin pleads not guilty in college bribery scam,"
NEW YORK (AFP) - American actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, accused of paying a $500,000 bribe to secure their daughters’ entry into a prestigious California university, on Monday pleaded not guilty to money laundering charges.
The couple waived their right to appear before a judge to be formally accused and entered their pleas through documents filed by their attorneys, according to documents seen by AFP.
""Full House"" star Loughlin and her husband, designer Mossimo Giannulli, were among the 50 people -- including ""Desperate Housewives"" star Felicity Huffman -- indicted in the wide-ranging college bribery scandal.
Huffman pleaded guilty to paying $15,000 to boost her daughter’s SAT college entrance exam score.
Loughlin, 54, and Giannulli are accused of paying $500,000 in 2016 and 2017 so that their two daughters could gain entrance into the University of Southern California (USC) by posing as members of the rowing team.
Their charges of money laundering and bank fraud carry a penalty of up to 40 years in prison.
The ringleader behind the college admissions scam, William ""Rick"" Singer, who authorities say was paid about $25 million to bribe coaches and university administrators, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with authorities.
Besides USC, some of the universities targeted in the elaborate cheating scam include Yale, Stanford, UCLA and Georgetown. None of the schools or the students have been charged in the case.
According to prosecutors, the accused parents paid a firm run by Singer to cheat on college entrance exams for their children or to bribe coaches to help non-athletic students get scholarships. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-16-19/news_big_images/487194_51102256.jpg,entertainment,"The ringleader behind the college admissions scam, William ""Rick"" Singer, who authorities say was paid about $25 million to bribe coaches and university administrators, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with authorities.",neutral
