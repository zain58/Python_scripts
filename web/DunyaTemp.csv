PM Khan the legend cricketer, who won the cricket world cup for Pakistan in 1992 known for his idealism and philanthropic work, struggled to gain political roots in the country for 22 years by working on ground through his political party ‘Pakistan Tehreek Insaaf’ was placed in the category of most influential leaders of 2019.
PM Imran spearheading the campaign against corruption and injustice, raised awareness among the masses and gained power in the general elections of 2018.
Other prominent figures in the leaders’ category are UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, Chinese President Xi Jin Ping, US President Donald Trump and New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern among many others.
Eminent journalist Ahmed Rashid wrote
‘Pakistan is at a critical crossroads, and the man in charge is the closest it has to a rock star. Imran Khan captained the team that won the 1992 Cricket World Cup, built a world-class cancer hospital in Lahore, then a top-notch university for kids who could never have dreamed of attending one. Twenty years ago, he entered politics—a dirty business in Pakistan at the best of times.’
‘Now he is Prime Minister of an impoverished nation that cannot pay its bills and is dependent on handouts from rich neighbors like China and the Arab Gulf states. Critics say Khan is too close to the army and Islamic fundamentalists, and chooses advisers poorly. Driven by fierce ambition, he can be cold and calculating. But he still generates the broadest hope among young and old that he can turn Pakistan around, and help make South Asia an ocean of peace rather than a state of permanent conflict.

Pharma industry announces to slash prices of 395 essential medicines ,"
KARACHI (Dunya News) – In order to provide due economic relief to masses, Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers  Association (PPMA) on Wednesday announced to curtail prices of 395 essential medicines whose prices had been reduced by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) but not implemented by the pharmaceutical industry and also announced to slash prices of 464 medicines voluntarily by 10 to 15 percent.
Addressing a press conference in Karachi on Wednesday, PMMA Chairman Zahid Saeed announced to reduce prices of 395 essential medicines from one percent to 471 percent as per government’s SRO no. 1610 and within 15 days, these medicines would be available on reduced prices throughout Pakistan. 
Accompanied by the representative from multinational pharmaceutical companies in Pakistan Ayesha Tammy Haq and in the presence of several drug manufacturers, the PPMA chairman said they were forced to lower down the prices of medicines with heavy heart on the pressure from the health minister as well as Commerce Advisor Abdul Razzaq Dawood as increase in cost of production of medicines had made doing business very difficult in Pakistan. 
At the same time, the pharmaceutical industry has voluntarily decided to lower the prices of another 464 medicines by 10-15 percent and providing it to the people on their original cost of production, the PPMA Chairman announced, saying medicines whose prices were being reduced were very well known and commonly used medicines for the treatment of communicable as well as non-communicable diseases.
Recently, the government allowed increase in prices of around 45000 medicines by 15 percent following a suo moto taken by the Supreme Court of Pakistan but in some hardship cases, prices of 464 medicines were increased over 15 percent because their cost of production had become unbearable for the industry and production of many of these drugs had been stopped by the pharmaceutical manufacturers.
“It is very painful and challenging decision for pharmaceutical industry since hardship cases were decided in Nov 2018 where rupee were priced 138 against the US dollar. Today it is 143”, Zahid Saeed said, adding that continuation of these prices is possible if dollar does not appreciate, utilities prices are maintained and government is able to control inflation as prices of drugs cannot be isolated from these factors.
PPMA Chairman announced that the decisions are implemented from today onwards and work on replacement of stocks has commenced to ensure availability of reduced price, adding that process to recover and replace stocks at distributor / retail shelf level will be 100% complete in next 15 days since logistics will take time and shortage have to be avoided. 
Zahid Saeed maintained that the government had allowed 15 percent increase in prices of locally produced medicines in January this year to ensure the very survival of the pharmaceutical industry of the country facing serious economic challenges in its strive to produce quality drugs at affordable prices for the patients in Pakistan.
Increase in prices of medicines had been in conformity with the several directions of the apex judiciary on the issue, he said and added that in case the government had not allowed the much-needed relief to the Pakistani medicines’ manufacturers in the form of 15 percent increase in locally produced drugs, public healthcare system of the country would have been in sheer shambles due to unavailability of medicines.
“Cost of production of the local Pharma industry had increased manifold since 2018 due to an unprecedented decrease in value of rupee as compared to the dollar while keeping in view the fact that up to 90 percent raw material of the industry was imported”, he informed. 
“In the meanwhile electricity tariff increased by 45 percent, the natural gas bill increased by 65 percent while diesel price also increased by 95 percent as all these factors also directly affect the cost of our production,” said the PPMA chairman.
Urging government to slash duties and taxes on import of raw material including packaging material, he said they contribute Rs50 billion annually to the national exchequer for form of taxes and added that if government makes them taxation free industry, they could slash prices by another 15-20 percent while they could also earn valuable foreign exchange by becoming the second largest exporting industry of Pakistan within two years.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-17-19/news_big_images/487465_58505557.jpg,pakistan,"Recently, the government allowed increase in prices of around 45000 medicines by 15 percent following a suo moto taken by the Supreme Court of Pakistan but in some hardship cases, prices of 464 medicines were increased over 15 percent because their cost of production had become unbearable for the industry and production of many of these drugs had been stopped by the pharmaceutical manufacturers.",positive

Five million lost jobs in India between 2016 and 2018: report,"
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - At least five million Indians lost their jobs between 2016 and 2018, and young urban men are being hit hardest, a Bengaluru-based private university said in a report on Tuesday.
The report by the Azim Premji University comes as Indians are voting in a staggered general election, which is due to end on May 19, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government keen to defend its economic record, including on jobs.
“In addition to rising open unemployment among the higher educated, the less educated (and likely informal) workers have also seen job losses and reduced work opportunities since 2016,” said Amit Basole, an economist and lead author of the report.
The report did not say how many jobs were created during the period.
Modi’s abrupt withdrawal of high value currency notes from circulation in November 2016, with the aim of curbing tax evasion and promoting digital transactions, disrupted small businesses and sparked layoffs.
The introduction of a national sales tax the following year compounded difficulties for some businesses.
The unemployed were mostly higher educated and young people, in the 20-24 age range, according to the study titled “State of Working India 2019”.
“Among urban men, for example, this age group accounts for 13.5 percent of the working age population but 60 percent of the unemployed,” it said.
Modi has faced criticism for not doing enough to create jobs for millions of unemployed young people despite official annual economic growth of about 7 percent for the past five years.
An official survey that the government withheld showed unemployment rose to its highest level in at least 45 years in 2017/18, the Business Standard newspaper reported in February.
The unemployment rate rose to 7.2 percent in February 2019, its highest since September 2016, and up from 5.9 percent in February 2018, according to data compiled by the private research house, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).
The report suggested the next government should consider an urban employment guarantee scheme to create jobs, build infrastructure and provide services.
India has a rural jobs guarantee programme, launched in 2006, which offers work to about 70 million rural people at the minimum wage for 100 days a year.
“India is at a crucial juncture in its economic development where timely public investment and public policy can reap huge rewards,” Basole said.

Iraq PM lands in Riyadh after Tehran visit,"
RIYADH (AFP) - Iraq s Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi met Saudi King Salman on Wednesday during his first official trip to Riyadh, days after his maiden visit to the Gulf kingdom s arch-nemesis Iran.
The meeting, reported by official Saudi media, comes amid a steady warming of ties between Baghdad and Riyadh after decades of strain.
The two countries signed 13 major agreements, Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya television said, without giving further details.
Saudi Arabia this month announced a billion-dollar aid package for Iraq, pledging stronger relations as the kingdom competes with Iran for influence over Iraq.
The Gulf powerhouse severed relations and closed its border with its northern neighbour after late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein s August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
But a flurry of visits between the two countries in recent months has indicated a thawing of ties as Riyadh seeks to counter Iran s strong presence in Iraqi politics.
Baghdad is also seeking economic benefits from closer ties with the wealthy kingdom, especially as it looks to repair the destruction left by years of fighting against the Islamic State  (IS) group.
Iran has been highly influential in Iraq since the toppling of Saddam in 2003, and was a key player in the territorial defeat of IS.
Abdel Mahdi, named premier last October, has said Iraq now wants good relations with both Tehran and Washington.
The US reimposed tough sanctions on Tehran s energy and finance sectors last year.
But it has granted Baghdad several temporary exemptions to allow it keep importing Iranian gas and electricity, crucial to Iraq s faltering power sector.

N.Korea's Kim oversees test of new weapon with 'powerful warhead',"
SEOUL (AFP) - North Korea s Kim Jong Un has supervised the test-firing of a new tactical weapon with a ""powerful warhead"", state media reported Thursday, in the first test of its kind since nuclear negotiations with Washington stalled.
The test marks a ratcheting up of tensions weeks after a summit between Kim and US President Donald Trump collapsed without agreement.
It also comes after satellite imagery suggested heightened activity at a nuclear test site.
Wednesday s test was ""conducted in various modes of firing at different targets"" the KCNA news outlet reported, adding that Kim ""guided the test-fire"".
The report said Kim described its development as one ""of very weighty significance in increasing the combat power of the People s Army"".
The ""advantages"" of the weapon were ""the peculiar mode of guiding flight and the load of a powerful warhead"", KCNA said.
The report gave no details of the weapon.
Missiles fired by the North have previously been tracked by the US and South Korean militaries, both of which closely watch events in the isolated nation.
Neither made any immediate announcement in the wake of the report.
""The description makes whatever was tested sound like a missile, but that could be everything from a small anti-tank guided missile to a surface-to-air missile to a rocket artillery system,"" said North Korea analyst Ankit Panda.
Earlier in the week, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a US monitor, said activity had been detected at Yongbyon, the North s main nuclear testing facility.
The think tank said evidence suggested Pyongyang may be reprocessing radioactive material into bomb fuel.
Kim s Hanoi summit with Trump, the second between the two men, ended abruptly, with North Korea later protesting that the US was being unreasonable in its demands.
Since then, North Korea has said it is mulling options for its diplomacy with the US, and Kim said last week he was open to talks with Trump only if Washington came with the ""proper attitude"".
""Kim is trying to make a statement to the Trump administration that his military potential is growing by the day,"" said Harry Kazianis, an analyst at the Center for the National Interest.
""His regime is becoming frustrated with Washington s lack of flexibility in recent negotiations.""
Koh Yu-hwan, professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University, agreed the test was a message to the US showing its displeasure over the stalled nuclear talks.
But the fact that it was not a long-range missile or nuclear test ""underscores Pyongyang wants to keep alive dialogue with Washington"", he added.
""Pyongyang cannot conduct a nuclear or long-range missile launch at this point unless it wants to totally shatter what remains of the US-North talks,"" he continued.
Pentagon officials said they were aware of the test report but declined to comment further.
Last November, KCNA reported that Kim oversaw the testing of a ""newly developed ultramodern tactical weapon"" months after his first meeting with Trump.
It was the first official report of a weapons test by North Korea since Kim and Trump s historic summit in Singapore over Pyongyang s nuclear and missile programme.
The North s latest weapon test report comes after South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Monday he wanted a fresh meeting with Kim ""regardless of venue and form"".
Pyongyang has yet to respond to Moon s overture.
Moon, who has long backed engagement with the nuclear-armed North, has been pushing for the resumption of inter-Korean economic projects, but doing so would fall foul of international sanctions imposed on Pyongyang.

Netanyahu formally named next Israeli PM,"
JERUSALEM (AFP) - Israeli President Reuven Rivlin on Wednesday formally handed Benjamin Netanyahu his letter of appointment to start building a coalition government following last week s general election.
In a televised ceremony, Rivlin told Netanyahu that in consultations with all parties elected to the incoming 120-seat parliament, ""65 MPs recommended you"".
Rivlin had sounded out delegations from political parties on Monday and Tuesday.
Only 45 members supported his main rivals from the Blue and White alliance led by ex-military chief Benny Gantz, with the 10 members of the Arab parties recommending nobody.
""This is the fifth time I am taking on the task of putting together the government of Israel,"" Netanyahu said at Wednesday s ceremony.
""There is no greater privilege in democratic life.""
In his remarks Rivlin referred to the election campaign, which candidates and commentators agreed had been exceptionally brutal.
""Things were said that should not have been said, from all sides,"" he said.
Netanyahu then pledged to serve all Israelis, opponents as well as supporters.
""I am well aware of the size of the responsibility placed upon my shoulders and shall act as the envoy of all of the people, those who voted for me and those who did not,"" he said.
He now has 28 days to form a government, with a possible extension of a further two weeks.
The results from the April 9 election put Netanyahu on course to become Israel s longest-serving prime minister later this year, surpassing the state s founding father David Ben-Gurion.
The 69-year-old s first task will be to reconcile divergent demands from his likely coalition partners.
They include ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and the strongly secular Yisrael Beitenu of former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman.
Netanyahu s outgoing government was seen as the most right-wing in Israel s history, and the next is expected to be similar if not further to the right.
Lieberman has said he would condition his joining the coalition on the adoption of a law aimed at drafting ultra-Orthodox Jews into the military like their secular counterparts.
Ultra-Orthodox Jews studying at religious seminaries are currently exempt from mandatory military service, a situation many Israelis see as unfair.
But attempts to change the law have met with strong opposition from ultra-Orthodox political parties, which won 16 seats in the incoming parliament.
On Tuesday, United Torah Judaism -- one of the two ultra-Orthodox parties -- stressed they were not prepared to compromise over Lieberman s demands, even at the risk of Netanyahu failing to form a coalition.
""We have already proven we won t have a problem to face another election,"" the party said in a statement.
Ultra-Orthodox Jews make up some 10 percent of Israel s population of nearly nine million.
The coming months are also expected to see the unveiling of US President Donald Trump s long-awaited plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace.
Trump has shown no sign so far that he would be willing to make significant demands of his close ally Netanyahu in connection with his plan, though even minor concessions to the Palestinians could spark opposition from the Israeli premier s far-right coalition partners.
Before the election, Netanyahu pledged to annex West Bank settlements in a move that would make Palestinian statehood all but impossible if done on a large-scale.
He will now face pressure to follow through but Israel s UN ambassador said Wednesday that nothing would be done on the issue before the Trump plan is revealed.
""We will wait. We will see the plan. We will engage and I don t know where it will lead us,"" Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters.
But the biggest danger hanging over Netanyahu is his potential indictment on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.
Israel s attorney general has announced his intention to indict Netanyahu, pending an upcoming hearing. He would be the country s first sitting prime minister to be indicted.
Netanyahu is not legally required to resign if indicted, only if convicted with all appeals exhausted, but political pressure would likely be intense.
Many analysts said one of Netanyahu s main motivations in calling early elections was to be able to confront the charges with a fresh electoral mandate behind him.

"Facing arrest, former Peru president Garcia kills himself","
LIMA (AFP) - Peru s former president Alan Garcia died in hospital on Wednesday after shooting himself in the head at his home as police were about to arrest him in a sprawling corruption case. He was 69.
The health ministry said Garcia died at 10:05 am (1505 GMT) of ""a massive cerebral hemorrhage from a gunshot wound and cardiorespiratory arrest.""
Garcia was resuscitated three times after suffering heart attacks while undergoing emergency surgery, before finally succumbing, Peru s Health Minister Zulema Tomas said.
The Casimiro Ulloa Emergency Hospital in Lima earlier confirmed he had suffered ""a bullet wound to his head.""
""This morning there was a regrettable accident: the president took the decision to shoot himself,"" Erasmo Reyna, Garcia s lawyer, told reporters outside the hospital after Garcia was admitted.
""Alan Garcia has died, long live APRA,"" said Omar Quesada, the general secretary of Garcia s American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA) party.
The attempted arrest unfolded at 6:30 am (1130 GMT) at Garcia s home in Lima s upmarket Miraflores neighborhood.
Police were acting on an arrest warrant for money laundering that would have allowed Garcia to be held for 10 days, giving authorities time to gather evidence and prevent him from fleeing, the prosecutor s office said.
Ricardo Pinedo, Garcia s secretary, said the former president had four or five weapons in his home that were gifts from the armed forces. Police said he used one of those to shoot himself.
Interior Minister Carlos Moran said police ""heard a gunshot a few minutes"" after entering Garcia s house before finding him ""sitting down with a head wound.""
Peru s President Martin Vizcarra expressed his sympathy on his Twitter account.
""Dismayed by the death of ex-president Alan Garcia. I send my condolences to his family and loved ones,"" Vizcarra wrote in a tweet.
Chilean President Sebastian Pinera and Bolivia s Evo Morales added their own condolences, while Colombian leader Ivan Duque said ""with sadness we raise prayers"" for Garcia s family, adding: ""Rest in peace.""
APRA congressman Mauricio Mulder said Garcia ""took a dignified and honorable decision. An honorable act in the face of fascist persecution.""
Dozens of tearful supporters congregated at the hospital entrance when the news was announced.
Garcia, who was president from 1985-90 and again from 2006-11, was suspected of having taken bribes from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht in return for large-scale public works contracts.
In November, he sought refuge in the Uruguayan Embassy after a court ordered him not to leave the country for 18 months.
He applied for asylum but following 16 days in the embassy he left when his request was denied.
Garcia, a social democrat, claimed to be the target of political persecution, an accusation denied by centrist Vizcarra.
On Tuesday, Garcia had said he would neither try to flee nor hide again.
He had recently insisted that ""there is no statement, evidence or deposit that links me to any crime and even less so with the Odebrecht company or the execution of any of its projects.""
Although under investigation by the public prosecutor s office, Garcia had not been charged with anything. He had strongly protested his innocence and seemed prepared to cooperate with authorities.
He was one of four Peruvian ex-presidents embroiled in various corruption scandals -- alongside Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (2016-18), Ollanta Humala (2011-16) and Alejandro Toledo (2001-06).
Kuczynski, who is accused of money laundering and was being held under a 10-day preliminary detention until April 20, was also taken to hospital on Wednesday suffering from high blood pressure.
The 80-year-old was being treated in intensive care and had a cardiac catheter fitted, lawmaker Gilbert Violeta said.
Toledo faces extradition from the United States, having been charged with taking a $20 million Odebrecht bribe.
Odebrecht has admitted paying $29 million in bribes to Peruvian officials over three administrations.
Some of those payments were allegedly made during Garcia s second term in office to secure a contract to build the Lima metro.
Peruvian press reports also claim Garcia received a $100,000 payment from an illicit Odebrecht fund for giving a speech to Brazilian business leaders in Sao Paulo in May 2012.
Prosecutors allege that Garcia and 21 other officials conspired to enable Dutch company ATM Terminals to win a 2011 concession to operate a terminal at the port of Callao, near Lima.
Another ex-president, Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000), is serving a 25-year sentence for crimes against humanity and corruption.
His daughter, opposition leader Keiko Fujimori, is being held in pre-trial detention for up to three years, accused of accepting $1.2 million in illicit party funding from Odebrecht for her 2011 presidential campaign.

29 German tourists killed in Portuguese bus crash,"
LISBON (AFP) - Twenty-nine German tourists were killed on Wednesday when a bus crashed on the Portuguese island of Madeira.
Televised images showed the bus had spun off the road, apparently having flipped several times, before crashing into a house at the bottom of a slope.
""Horrible news comes to us from Madeira,"" a German government spokesman tweeted after the deadly crash.
""Our deep sorrow goes to all those who lost their lives in the bus accident, our thoughts are with the injured,"" he added.
Filipe Sousa, mayor of Santa Cruz where the accident happened, said 17 women and 11 men were killed in the crash, with another 21 injured.
A doctor told reporters another woman died of her injuries in hospital.
""I express the sorrow and solidarity of all the Portuguese people in this tragic moment, and especially for the families of the victims who I have been told were all German,"" President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa told Portuguese television.
He said he would travel to Madeira overnight.
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa added on Twitter that he had contacted German Chancellor Angela Merkel to convey his condolences.
""It is with profound sadness that I heard of the accident on Madeira,"" he wrote on the government s Twitter page.
""I took the occasion to convey my sadness to Chancellor Angela Merkel at this difficult time,"" he added.
The regional protection service in Madeira confirmed 28 deaths in the accident that happened at 6:30 pm (1730 GMT), while hospital authorities said another woman later died of her injuries.
The bus had been carrying around 50 passengers.
Regional government Vice President Pedro Calado said it was ""premature"" to speculate on the cause of the crash, adding that the vehicle was five years old and that ""everything had apparently been going well"".
Judicial authorities had opened an investigation into the circumstances of the accident, the Madeira public prosecutor s office told the Lusa news agency.
Medical teams were being sent from Lisbon to help local staff carry out post-mortems on the dead.
Often called the Pearl of the Atlantic, Madeira hosts thousands of tourists each year, attracted to its subtropical climate and rugged volcanic terrain.

Trump: world's greatest expert on... almost everything,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - President Donald Trump raised eyebrows when he told French firefighters to move ""quickly"" and possibly use aerial water tankers to save Notre Dame. But it was hardly the first time he has come forward as an unlikely expert.
Monday s tweeted advice got short shrift from French authorities racing to save the renowned Paris cathedral.
Bombardment with large quantities of water from airplanes could have flattened the 850-year-old building, French emergency services said.
Trump s confidence in his eclectic knowledge base, however, is unlikely to have been shaken.
Here are some other nuggets of wisdom from a president, lifelong real estate developer and former TV show host whom The Washington Post accuses of having made more than 9,000 false or misleading statements in two years.

- PR man -

Trump is worried about aerospace giant Boeing s reputation following two recent crashes of the 737 MAX model. He also has a solution: change the name.
""What do I know about branding, maybe nothing (but I did become President!), but if I were Boeing, I would FIX the Boeing 737 MAX, add some additional great features, & REBRAND the plane with a new name,"" Trump tweeted. ""No product has suffered like this one. But again, what the hell do I know?""
-- April 2019

- Renewable energy theories -

Citing widely disproven or unproven theories, the president says wind turbine energy cannot handle variations in output -- and is bad for you.
""If it doesn t blow, you can forget about television for that night,"" he told a rally, imitating a couple relying on wind-generated power.
""Darling, I want to watch television.   I m sorry! The wind isn t blowing.  I know a lot about wind.""
-- March 2019
""The noise causes cancer.""
-- April 2019

-- Tech guru --

Although mostly known for his work with buildings and golf courses, Trump has quite a bit to say about aerospace.
Musing earlier on the Boeing 737 MAX tragedies, Trump tweeted: ""Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly. Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the time in many products. Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better.""
-- March 2019
He s also shared his expertise on drones at a cabinet meeting:
""I know more about drones than anybody.""
-- January 2019
But Trump sees himself equally as standing up for rather older technology, like walls on the US-Mexican border.
""Nothing (else)... will work, and that has been true for thousands of years,"" he tweeted. ""I know tech better than anyone.""
-- December 2018

-- Good genes --

If Trump has unusual smarts, he knows why.
""My uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart,"" he said in a speech.
""If I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world - it s true!""
-- July 2016

-- Bad experts --

But even if the president is an expert, he doesn t trust regular experts -- like the ones he says have been giving bad foreign policy advice to his predecessors in the White House.
""You know, I ve always wanted to say this -- I ve never said this before with all the talking we all do -- all of these experts... The experts are terrible,"" he said in a speech.
-- April 2016
In fact, he suggests that it would be better if he were left in charge of thorny issues like the battle with Islamic State and other radical Islamist jihadist groups.
""I know more about ISIS than the generals do,"" he told a rally.

"China home to 20 million Muslims, over 35,000 mosques guarantees normal religious practices: Spokesperson","
BEIJING (APP) - China Wednesday said it guaranteed normal religious practices and respect the customs of religious believers and asked the western media to abide by journalistic ethics while reporting about vocational training institutions in Xinjiang.
“First of all, I want to correct you again. I don’t know what the ‘re-education camp’ you are talking about,” Chinese foreign ministry’s spokesperson Lu Kang said during his routine briefing while responding to a reporter who claimed that re-education camp in Xinjiang were linked to demolitions of Muslims mosques across China.
“We have said many times that the vocational skills education and training institutions established in Xinjiang have a very clear purpose,” he added.
The spokesperson informed that like other countries in the world, the Chinese government was taking preventive measures based on the need to fight terrorism and de-extremism.
“Such measures may be different in different countries, but the objectives are the same,” he added.
Lu Kang said, “As for your reference to the existence of anti-Islamism in China, I can tell you responsibly that there is no such situation.”
He said China implemented the policy of freedom of religious belief, adding, “Like other countries, we manage religious affairs in accordance with the law, resolutely oppose and combat religious extremism, and at the same time guarantee the normal religious needs of religious believers and respect the customs of religious believers.”
The spokesperson said China had more than 20 million Muslims and more than 35,000 mosques. The majority of religious believers could freely engage in religious activities in accordance with the law.
“I hope that the relevant media should not be keen on some untrue words, let alone concoct false news, but should abide by the journalistic professional ethics,” he added.
Two separate groups of Beijing-based diplomats and journalized had visited vocational training centers in Kashgar and Hotian in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.
They were briefed that vocational education centers had proved effective in eliminating religious extremism in the region.
They were told that these centers were not concentration or re-education camps as portrayed in some media reports rather they were like boarding schools where trainees enjoy free food and accommodations, learn languages, study laws and acquire skills. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-17-19/news_big_images/487483_14698602.jpg,world,"Lu Kang said, “As for your reference to the existence of anti-Islamism in China, I can tell you responsibly that there is no such situation.”

India PM's party fields candidate accused in bomb blast,"
NEW DELHI (AFP) - The ruling party of India s Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced Wednesday it will field a candidate accused of involvement in a deadly 2008 bomb blast in the country s ongoing national election.
Pragya Singh Thakur, a 48-year-old female monk, is out on bail while she faces charges related to the attack that killed six people.
She announced Wednesday that she will run for a seat in the city of Bhopal on the ticket of Modi s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Thakur, a firebrand speaker, made national headlines after the blast close to a mosque in western Maharashtra state s Malegaon city that also injured around 100 people.
She was arrested shortly after the attack and was described by authorities as a leading plotter.
Indian law allows candidates facing court cases to run up until the time of any conviction.
""All conspiracies against me have failed. I am an ascetic monk and will ensure justice and respect for my country,"" Thakur said, clad in traditional Hindu saffron clothes, at a press conference in Bhopal.
""I am confident, fully confident. I am ready for politics and (this) religious war,"" she added, flanked by regional party leaders.
Thakur was released on bail in 2017 and has had one charge against her dropped but still faces other charges in the ongoing trial.
Her candidacy in Bhopal -- a BJP stronghold constituency in a key heartland state -- is expected to polarise local voters.
Her main rival is the outspoken and controversial Digvijaya Singh, from the opposition Congress party.
Hindu nationalists accuse Singh of using the term ""saffron terror"", which they view as objectionable, to refer to acts of violence by right-wing extremists targeting areas with large Muslim populations.
India s election is taking place in seven phases, with voting in Bhopal not scheduled until May 12.
Results in the vote, the world s largest, are expected on May 23.
The election is seen as a referendum on Modi, who is seeking a second term from the country s 900 million voters.

Security shutdowns and patrols as tense Kashmir prepares to vote,"
SRINAGAR (AFP) - Security forces shut down roads and stepped up patrols Wednesday in the restive Indian state of Kashmir, a day before voters in the region go to the polls.
Tens of thousands of security forces have poured into the state ahead of Thursday s vote, which is the second phase of India s massive elections.
Tensions have skyrocketed in Kashmir since a February suicide attack that killed 40 Indian paramilitaries and led to India and Pakistan exchanging cross-border strikes.
The two countries, which both control part of divided Kashmir, briefly appeared on the brink of war after the exchange of fire, though a more serious clash was averted.
But Indian authorities are taking no chances during voting, deploying tens of thousands of security forces to the state to join the half a million soldiers already stationed there. ""We have made elaborate security arrangements for peaceful polling,"" Swayam Prakash Pani, inspector general of the local police force, told AFP.
All civilian vehicles have been banned from the city s main boulevard, which leads to a poll material distribution centre.
Across the city, police and paramilitary troops in combat fatigues and wielding automatic rifles have been deployed, including along the banks of the Jhelum river that winds through Srinagar.
Barbed wire barricades have been erected and police have issued traffic advisories asking residents to avoid parts of the city. Many residents have simply opted to stay home, with the traffic in the city dominated by troops and polling staff moving in military vehicles.
A local private transport operator said the government had hired more than 3,000 vehicles to ferry polling officials around parts of the state during the vote. Security measures taken after the February attack have stirred some resentment, in particular new restrictions on a 200-kilometre stretch of key highway that runs north-south in the state.
After the attack, the stretch of road was ordered closed every Sunday and Wednesday while government forces move along it. Earlier this month, a patient died inside an ambulance that was forced to stop on the highway as a police convoy moved along it. On Wednesday, authorities briefly lifted the restrictions, but they are otherwise expected to remain in place until the elections are over.
 

War of words

India and Pakistan have disputed control of Kashmir since the two countries won their freedom from British rule in 1947. The rivals have fought two wars over the Himalayan territory and came close to waging a third with cross-border air raids in February. But the vote also comes against the backdrop of a bitter war of words between Prime Minister Narendra Modi s ruling party and pro-India politicians in Kashmir over two contentious constitutional articles.
Modi s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has long sought to repeal Articles 370 and 35A, which give residents of Kashmir exclusive access to local land, state government jobs and higher education spots.
Opponents argue that the articles give Kashmir a status that sets it apart from the rest of India.

Egypt sets referendum on extending Sisi's rule for April 20-22,"
(AFP) – Egypt on Wednesday set a referendum for April 20-22 on sweeping consitutional changes including amendments that could extend President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi s rule until 2030.
""The referendum process ... will take place inside Egypt... from April 20-22,"" Lashin Ibrahim, head of the National Election Authority said at a press conference.
The announcement came after Egypt s parliament on Tuesday overwhelmingly passed the changes, despite complaints from critics that they are ""unconstitutional"" and designed to ""consolidate authoritarianism"".
The amendments extend presidential terms from four to six years, but maintain a limit of two terms.
Under the changes, Sisi s current term will be prolonged to 2024 from 2022 and he would then be allowed to run for another six-year term.
The constitutional changes also include giving the military greater influence in political life, granting Sisi wide control over the judiciary and broadening the jurisdiction of military courts over civilians.
As a military chief, Sisi led the army s overthrow of elected president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 following mass protests against the Islamist leader s rule.
He won his first term as president in 2014 and was re-elected in March 2018 with more than 97 percent of the vote, after standing virtually unopposed.
His government has been widely criticised by human rights groups for the repression of political opponents.

India cancels poll in southern area over 'vote buying',"
NEW DELHI (AFP) - Indian election authorities have cancelled voting in a southern region of the country after seizing more than 110 million rupees ($1.5 million) they believe was meant to influence the outcome, officials said Wednesday.
It is the first time a ballot has been cancelled in a national election over attempted vote-buying, officials said.
The decision comes as Indians vote in a mammoth national election being held over several phases, the next of which begins Thursday.
But voters in the Vellore constituency in coastal Tamil Nadu state will not be going to the polls as scheduled after the Election Commission of India ruled there were fears of a ""systematic design to influence voters"".
The ruling came after authorities seized more than 110 million rupees from a candidate in the run-up to the vote.
The commission said late Tuesday that the environment in Vellore was no longer conducive to ""free and ethical"" elections.
No fresh date has been announced for polling in the constituency.
Nearly 100 constituencies in 13 states go to the polls Thursday in the second round of the seven-phase election that began on April 11.
Almost 900 million voters are eligible to cast their votes to elect 543 members to the lower house of the parliament, with results expected on May 23.
Attempts to secure votes in return for cash, liquor, electronic gadgets and even goats have been reported across Tamil Nadu in the run-up to voting.
More than 1.3 billion rupees ($18.7 million) and one ton of gold worth 3 billion rupees have been seized in the state since the poll dates were announced on March 10.
Elsewhere in the country, polls have been delayed by five days in parts of the northeastern state of Tripura over security fears.
Polls will be held there on April 23 instead of Thursday.
And in the country’s east, Bangladeshi star actor Ferdous Ahmed has been forced to leave India after he was discovered campaigning for a candidate from the opposition Congress party, officials at the Bangladesh High Commission in Kolkata said. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-17-19/news_big_images/487397_94033318.jpg,world,"

Indian Navy helicopter crashed in Arabian sea ,"
NEW DELHI (Dunya News) – Indian Navy helicopter crashed after developing a technical failure in Arabian sea last week, the naval branch of the Indian Armed Forces disclosed on Tuesday.
The navy has claimed to have averted ‘a major catastrophe’ as their Chetak helicopter ditched at Arabian sea.
However, all crew members were reported safe.
It said a board of inquiry has been ordered to investigate the cause of the technical failure leading to the loss of the helicopter.
The helicopter was part of an Indian naval warship which was deployed in the Arabian sea.

New Zealand disarms police as terror threat level lowered,"
WELLINGTON (AFP) - New Zealand police on Wednesday ended the routine arming of frontline officers as the terrorism threat level was lowered a month after the Christchurch mosques massacre.
Police and security agencies reduced the threat level from high to medium, meaning authorities judge that another attack, violent criminal behaviour, or violent protest remains ""feasible"" rather than ""very likely"".
The level is still higher than it was before the March 15 attacks, when the threat was deemed to be ""low"".
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said ""there is no current specific threat"", but the security agencies believed the medium level ""accurately reflects our current status"".
Frontline New Zealand police have historically not carried firearms and many people were shocked to see them heavily armed after 50 Muslims were gunned down while at Friday prayers.
Police commissioner Mike Bush said with the easing of the security threat level, the police had reassessed their position on arming frontline staff and the carrying of weapons would now be decided on a case-by-case basis.
The decision was made after ""significant consultation"" with mosques and Islamic Centres in relation to ongoing security, although Bush said he would not release details.
""There was never any intention for the routine carriage of firearms to continue indefinitely,"" Bush said.
""Generally this means frontline staff will transition back to our normal approach regarding carriage and access to firearms.
The police also released a timeline of the mosque attacks, showing it took 18 minutes from the time of the first emergency call to the apprehension of the alleged shooter.

Valley of the dolls: scarecrows outnumber people in Japan village,"
NAGORO (AFP) - In the tiny village of Nagoro, deep in the mountains of western Japan, the wind howls down a deserted street with not a living soul to be seen.
But yet the street appears busy, dotted with life-sized dolls that outnumber humans 10 to one, the product of a one-woman bid to counter the emptiness and loneliness felt in Nagoro, like many Japanese villages decimated by depopulation.
Nagoro, around 550 kilometres (400 miles) southwest of Tokyo, has become known as the valley of dolls after local resident Tsukimi Ayano began placing scarecrows on the street to inject some life into her depopulated village.
""Only 27 people live in this village but the number of scarecrows is tenfold, like 270,"" the 69-year-old doll maker told AFP in an interview at her home.
It all started 16 years ago when the dexterous Ayano created a scarecrow dressed in her father’s clothes to prevent birds eating the seeds she had planted in her garden.
""A worker who saw it in the garden thought it really was my father... he said hello but it was a scarecrow. It was funny,"" recalled Ayano.
Since then, Ayano has not stopped creating the life-size dolls, made with wooden sticks, newspapers to fill the body, elastic fabrics for skin and knitting wool for hair.
The skillful craftswoman needs only three days to make an adult-sized doll that are now scattered all around the village.
The secret to breathing life into the dolls? Applying pink colour to the lips and cheeks with a make-up brush, revealed Ayano.
At the local school, she has placed 12 colourful child-sized dolls at desks, positioned as if part of a lively class poring over their books.
The school closed seven years ago as there was no one left to teach, she recalled sadly.
""Now there are no children. The youngest person here is 55 years old.""
Down the street, a ""family"" of scarecrows lounges in front of an abandoned grocery shop while a doll dressed as an old farmer window-shops next door.
Near the bus stop, a group of scarecrows gathers as another ""father"" doll pulls a cart full of ""children.""

‘It’s lonely now’ 


While never humming with people, Ayano remembers as a child that Nagoro was once a well-to-do place with some 300 residents and labourers supported by the forestry industry and dam construction work.
""People gradually left... It’s lonely now,"" she said. ""I made more dolls as I remembered the time when the village was lively.""
Nagoro’s plight is replicated all around Japan, as the world’s third-largest economy battles a declining population, low birth rate and high life expectancy.
The country is on the verge of becoming the first ""ultra-aged"" country in the world, meaning that 28 percent of people are aged 65 or above.
The latest government report shows that 27.7 percent of a population of 127 million -- one in four people -- are aged 65 or older and the figure is expected to jump to 37.7 percent in 2050.
According to experts, around 40 percent of Japan’s 1,700 municipalities are defined as ""depopulated.""

‘Extremely difficult’ 


After World War II, when forestry and agriculture were the main economic drivers, many Japanese lived in rural villages like Nagoro. But young people started to leave for Tokyo in the 1960s, said Takumi Fujinami, economist at the Japan Research Institute.
""The economy was booming in Tokyo and industrial areas at that time. They were the only places people could earn money, so a lot of young people moved there,"" he said.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged to revive regions outside Tokyo by pumping in tens of billions of yen, but this is not enough to stop young people from leaving their hometowns to work in Tokyo, Fujinami said.
""In order to combat depopulation, we need people moving in to depopulated areas. But recovering the population is extremely difficult,"" he said.
""Instead, it’s important to increase income or improve working conditions for young people in rural areas.""
For example, companies in rural areas tend to have fewer holidays than those in Tokyo, he said.
""We need to create communities where young people can make a long-term living ,"" Fujinami said, adding that subsidising them to move in is not enough.
While there is little evidence of citizens returning to Nagoro, Ayano’s dolls have attracted flesh-and-blood people from as far afield as the US and France.
""Before I started making scarecrows, nobody stopped by. Now many people visit here,"" she said.
""I hope Nagoro will become lively again and many people come here for sightseeing.""
""I don’t know what Nagoro will look like in 10 or 20 years... but I’ll keep on making dolls."" ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-17-19/news_big_images/487358_19452946.jpg,world,"They were the only places people could earn money, so a lot of young people moved there,"" he said.",positive
Trump vetoes bill to end US support for Saudi-led Yemen war,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday vetoed a resolution from Congress directing him to end US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, the second such move of his presidency.
The resolution was a harsh bipartisan rebuke to Trump that took the historic step of curtailing a president s war-making powers -- a step he condemned in a statement announcing his veto.
""This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,"" Trump said.
The veto was the second of his presidency, after he overrode a congressional resolution that aimed to reverse the border emergency he declared in order to secure more funding for his wall between the United States and Mexico in March.
Vetoing the measure is an ""effective green light for the war strategy that has created the world s worst humanitarian crisis to continue,"" said International Rescue Committee president and CEO David Miliband.
""Yemen is at a breaking point with 10 million people on the brink of famine. There are as many as 100 civilian casualties per week, and Yemenis are more likely to be killed at home than in any other structure.""
Trump argued that US support for the bloody war between the Saudi-backed Yemeni government and Iran-aligned Huthi rebels was necessary for a variety of reasons, ""first and foremost"" to ""protect the safety of the more than 80,000 Americans who reside in certain coalition countries.""
These countries ""have been subject to Huthi attacks from Yemen,"" he said, referring to drone and missile strikes the Saudi-led coalition has either claimed were intercepted or denied altogether.
The president also said the resolution would ""harm the foreign policy of the United States"" and ""harm our bilateral relationships.""
And it would ""negatively affect our ongoing efforts to prevent civilian casualties and prevent the spread of terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS, and embolden Iran s malign activities in Yemen,"" Trump said, referring to two Sunni Muslim militant groups and his Shiite bete noire.
The resolution, which passed the US House of Representatives earlier this month and the Senate in March, was a historic milestone, as it was the first time in history that a measure invoking the 1973 War Powers Resolution reached the president s desk.
Democrats argued that US involvement in the Yemen conflict -- through intelligence-sharing, logistical support and now-discontinued aerial refueling -- is unconstitutional without congressional authority.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi -- the country s most senior Democratic politician -- took aim at Trump s veto in a series of tweets on Tuesday.
""The conflict in Yemen is a horrific humanitarian crisis that challenges the conscience of the entire world,"" Pelosi wrote. ""Yet the President has cynically chosen to contravene a bipartisan, bicameral vote of the Congress & perpetuate America s shameful involvement in this heartbreaking crisis.""
Senator Bernie Sanders, a lead author of the Yemen resolution and a Democratic 2020 presidential candidate, said that ""the people of Yemen desperately need humanitarian help, not more bombs.""
""I am disappointed, but not surprised, that Trump has rejected the bi-partisan resolution to end U.S. involvement in the horrific war in Yemen,"" Sanders tweeted.
Critics of the intervention warn that Saudi forces are likely using US weapons to commit atrocities in the four-year war.
Some 10,000 people have been killed in Yemen over the past four years, according to the World Health Organization, although rights groups say the toll could be five times higher.
Both the Saudi-led alliance and Huthi rebels have been accused of acts that could amount to war crimes, while the coalition has been blacklisted by the United Nations for killing and maiming children.

UN in negotiations on Libya ceasefire,"
UNITED NATIONS (AFP) - United Nations Security Council diplomats began negotiations Tuesday on a British-drafted resolution that would demand an immediate ceasefire in Libya after forces loyal to commander Khalifa Haftar launched an offensive on Tripoli.
The proposed text seen by AFP warns that the offensive by Haftar s Libyan National Army (LNA) ""threatens the stability of Libya and prospects for a United Nations-facilitated political dialogue and a comprehensive political solution to the crisis.""
The council ""demands that all parties in Libya immediately de-escalate the situation, commit to a ceasefire, and engage with the United Nations to ensure a full and comprehensive cessation of hostilities throughout Libya,"" the draft says.
After Britain circulated the text late Monday, a first round of negotiations was held during which Russia raised objections to references criticizing Haftar, diplomats said.
""They were very clear. No reference anywhere,"" a council diplomat said.
Britain was hoping to bring the measure to a vote at the council before Friday, but diplomats pointed to Russia s objections as a hurdle.
At least 174 people have been killed and more than 18,000 displaced since Haftar ordered his forces to march on Tripoli on April 4, according to UN figures. A rocket attack on the city killed two people and injured four on Tuesday.
Last week, Russia blocked a draft council statement that would have called on Haftar s forces to halt their advance on Tripoli.
The proposed measure echoed a call for a ceasefire by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who was in Libya to personally advance prospects for a political solution when the offensive was launched.
Haftar, seen by his allies Egypt and the United Arab Emirates as a bulwark against Islamists, has declared he wants to seize the capital, now controlled by a UN-recognized government and an array of militias.
Haftar backs a rival administration based in eastern Libya that is refusing to recognize the authority of the Tripoli government.
The draft resolution calls on all sides in Libya ""immediately to re-commit"" to UN peace efforts and urges all member-states ""to use their influence over the parties"" to see that the resolution is respected.
Resolutions adopted by the council are legally binding.
Diplomats have long complained that foreign powers backing rival sides in Libya threatened to turn the conflict into a proxy war.
Saudi Arabia is also seen as a key Haftar supporter, while Qatar -- which has tense ties with Riyadh and Abu Dhabi -- has called for stronger enforcement of the UN arms embargo to keep weapons out of Haftar s hands.
Russia and France, two permanent council members, have praised Haftar s battlefield successes in defeating Libyan armed groups aligned with the Islamic State in the south of the country.
Haftar s offensive on the capital forced the United Nations to postpone a national conference that was to draw up a roadmap to elections, meant to turn the page on years of chaos since the 2011 ouster of Moamer Kadhafi.
Guterres has said that serious negotiations on Libya s future cannot resume without a ceasefire.

Muslim-majority Indonesia votes in its biggest-ever election,"
JAKARTA (AFP) - Indonesia kicked off one of the world s biggest one-day elections Wednesday, pitting president Joko Widodo against ex-general Prabowo Subianto in a race to lead the Muslim-majority nation.
More than 190 million Indonesians are set to cast a ballot as polls opened shortly after 7:00 am local time (2200 GMT Tuesday) in restive Papua. The vote is slated to end at 1:00 pm (0600 GMT) in Sumatra at the other end of the volcano-dotted archipelago.
Some voters went to their local mosque before casting ballots, as the daily call to prayer sounded across a nation that is nearly 90 percent Muslim.
A record 245,000 candidates are running for public office, from the presidency and parliamentary seats to local positions -- the first time all are being held on the same day.
Opinion polls show Widodo, 57, is a clear favourite -- but he faces a tough challenge from Subianto, 67, who has leaned on a fiery nationalist ticket and warned he will challenge the results over voter-list irregularities if he loses.
Subianto narrowly lost to Widodo in 2014 elections, and unsuccessfully challenged those results.
Voters will flock to more than 800,000 polling stations where they ll punch holes in ballots -- to make clear their candidate choice -- and then dip a finger in Muslim-approved halal ink, a measure to prevent double-voting in a graft-riddled country where ballot-buying is rife.
The polls present a huge logistical challenge in a country stretching 4,800 kilometres across more than 17,000 islands with a population of more than 260 million, including hundreds of ethnic groups and languages.
Officials were moving cardboard ballot boxes by motorbikes, boats and planes -- as well as elephants and horses -- to reach mountaintop villages and communities deep in the jungle.
A series of so-called ""quick counts"" are expected to give a reliable indication of the presidential winner later Wednesday. Official results are not expected until May.
The poll has been punctuated by bitter mudslinging and a slew of fake news online that threatens to sway millions of undecided voters.
Widodo has campaigned on his ambitious drive to build much-needed roads, airports and other infrastructure across Southeast Asia s largest economy.
But his rights record has been criticised owing to an uptick in discriminatory attacks on religious and other minorities, including a small LGBT community, as Islamic hardliners become more vocal in public life.
His choice of conservative cleric Ma ruf Amin as his running mate has also raised fears about the future of Indonesia s reputation for moderate Islam.
Raised in a bamboo shack in a riverside slum, the soft-spoken Widodo stands in stark contrast to Subianto, whose strongman image is underscored by a penchant for slamming lecterns as he accuses Jakarta of selling the country off to foreign interests.
Subianto -- joined by running mate Sandiaga Uno, a 49-year-old wealthy financier -- has courted Islamic hardliners, promised a boost to military and defence spending and, taking a page from US President Donald Trump, vowed to put ""Indonesia first"" by reviewing billions of dollars in Chinese investment.
Subianto s long-held presidential ambitions have been dogged by strong ties to the Suharto dictatorship, which collapsed two decades ago, and a chequered past.
He ordered the abduction of democracy activists as the authoritarian regime collapsed in 1998, and was accused of committing atrocities in East Timor.

Saudi king hosts Abu Dhabi crown prince amid Sudan turmoil,"
RIYADH (AFP) - Saudi Arabia s King Salman on Tuesday hosted Abu Dhabi s crown prince for talks, state media said, after the Gulf allies threw their support behind Sudan s military rulers who ousted veteran leader Omar al-Bashir.
Abu Dhabi s Prince Mohammed bin Zayed discussed ""regional developments"" with the king and his powerful son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the official Saudi Press Agency said in a brief report.
After weeks of silence on Sudan s political turmoil, Saudi Arabia and the UAE on Sunday released a brief reaction to Bashir s toppling following months of street protests, calling for ""stability"" and a ""peaceful transition"".
Saudi Arabia and the UAE both voiced backing for Sudan s Transitional Military Council, with Riyadh promising an aid package to Sudanese people.
Sudan plays a key role in the regional interests of Saudi Arabia and its allies, siding with Riyadh against Shiite Iran and providing troops in the Saudi-led coalition fighting in the Yemen war.
A senior Sudanese military official on Monday said troops from his country will remain in Yemen until the Arab alliance achieves its goals.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE intervened in the Yemen war in 2015 to fight Iran-aligned Huthi rebels.
The Gulf powerhouses are also following events in Libya, where forces loyal to warlord Khalifa Haftar launched an offensive on Tripoli, now controlled by a UN-recognised government and an array of militias.
Haftar s close ties to Saudi Arabia and the UAE are critical to his campaign, observers say.
Saudi Arabia is said to have recently pledged tens of millions of dollars to the warlord s forces, according to the Wall Street Journal.

MoC stressed to approach SA authorities for waiving anti-dumping duty on cement ,"
KARACHI (Dunya News) – Pakistan-South Africa Business Forum (PSABF) Chairman Mohammad Rafiq Memon has said that Pakistan’s cement exports to South Africa have suffered terribly during the last couple of years because of the anti-dumping duty imposed by the South African government that resulted in shrinking cement export to around US$100 to US$150 million which was around US$700 million prior to imposition of anti-dumping duty. 
“We are trying our best to get this issues resolved but Pakistan’s Ministry of Commerce (MoC) also has to send a delegation to South Africa in order to convince the authorities to review and waive this anti-dumping duty on cement”, he stressed while speaking at a meeting during the visit of South African delegation to Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Chairman PSABF was fairly optimistic that the South African government would review the anti-dumping duty on cement imports and the situation was likely to improve by 2020, provided the Ministry of Commerce takes up this issue with relevant authority in South Africa.
President PSABF (Pakistan Region) Ghulam Muhammad, Senior Vice President KCCI Khurram Shahzad, Vice President KCCI Asif Sheikh Javaid, Members of South African delegation and KCCI’s Managing Committee were also present at the meeting.
While requesting KCCI to participate in the forthcoming events being organised by PSABF in South Africa, he informed that PSABF plans to organise a 4-day seminar in the month of July 2019 which will be followed by a single country exhibition in October 2019 to highlight Pakistan’s trade potential. “Both these events in South Africa will provide a perfect opportunity to industrialists and traders from KCCI to introduce their products and services in South Africa which is a gateway to the entire African region”, he added.
He said that PSABF also plans to establish a trade center in South Africa by December 2019 where Pakistani manufacturers and exporters will be able to display samples of their products and services along with relevant contact information, which would results in effectively promoting Pakistani products not only in the South African market but also other African states.
“As Pakistan’s trade and diplomatic relations have not been so well with South Africa, therefore we are striving really hard to improve ties between the two countries”, he said, adding that potential exists to enhance trade and investment ties in tourism, textile, agriculture, pharmaceutical, mining and construction sectors. “Many South African investors are also interested in Pakistan’s hospitality, tourism and aviation sectors. They also want to establish mini zoos, Safari Parks and resorts in Karachi and Gilgit-Baltistan”, he added.
He mentioned that PSABF, which was formed in 2014, has enhanced its activities and the forum has been regularly holding negotiations with South African government and other stakeholders with a view to enhance trade and investment ties between the two countries. During the past four years, PSABF has received and facilitated 27 delegations from Pakistan and they look forward to receiving a delegation from Karachi Chamber in near future. “PSABF is not just confined to South Africa only but we have expanded our activities to nine more countries in the African region”, he added.
Senior Vice President KCCI Khurram Shahzad, while welcoming the South African delegates, assured to take up the anti-dumping issue being faced by Pakistani cement exporters with Ministry of Commerce so that the government could hold negotiations with relevant authorities in South Africa.
He pointed out that the economic relations between Pakistan and South Africa have remained cordial and it was really heartening to see that eight MoUs were signed during Pakistan-South Africa Joint Commission meeting in 2013 to increase trade value between countries to $1 billion which was finally achieved in 2017.
He said, “Pakistan and South Africa share moderate bilateral trade relations as we exported goods worth $178.15 million in 2018 to South Africa while our imports stood at $1.24 billion.”
Khurram Shahzad was of the opinion that there was a huge potential to enhance bilateral trade relations between Pakistan and South Africa. In this regard, Pakistan can increase its leather footwear exports to South Africa at competitive prices.
“CPEC depicts a great opportunity for Pakistan to further enhance its trade volume to South Africa”, he said, adding that Pakistan can also export meat products to South Africa market, as the country relies significantly on imported meat from Brazil and European countries.
He further stressed that both countries can enhance their mutual cooperation and knowledge transfer in the mining sector. For this purpose, Balochistan province offers a wonderful opportunity for both Pakistani and South-African companies to take different joint ventures.
He emphasised that the Karachi Chamber wants to promote business, mutual understanding and friendly relations between the business communities of Pakistan and South Africa. “We want to promote and do everything for the development of Pakistan–South Africa business cooperation”, he added.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-18-19/news_big_images/487495_20777877.jpg,business,"“We want to promote and do everything for the development of Pakistan–South Africa business cooperation”, he added.",neutral
"ADB releases annual report, financial results for 2018","
ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – The Asian Development Bank (ADB) released its Annual Report for 2018 on Tuesday. 
The report presents ADB’s important operational and organizational milestones over the past year, including key numbers and data of ADB operations, activities, and financial results.
It also focuses on the adoption of ADB’s new long-term corporate strategy, Strategy 2030, approved in July 2018, and highlights the strategic transition in progress across all aspects of ADB’s operations and organization.
The demand for ADB assistance continued to grow in 2018. New commitments included $21.6 billion in loans, grants, and investments from ADB’s own resources, exceeding the target of $19.71 billion and up 10% from 2017.
Private sector operations reached $3.14 billion, a 37% increase from 2017, which is 14.5% of ADB’s overall commitment. The result reflected ADB’s long-term strategy to increase support for private enterprise, especially in new markets and sectors, to create more high-quality jobs and to mobilize private financial resource for development.
ADB also successfully mobilized $14 billion in cofinancing from bilateral and multilateral agencies and other financing partners, including $7.17 billion in co-financing from ADB’s private sector operations. The increase in co-financing saw total new commitments reach $35.82 billion in 2018, a 13% increase over 2017, reflecting the importance of partnerships in addressing Asia and the Pacific’s continuously growing development needs.
Disbursements, a key indicator for successful project implementation, also improved, rising to $14.19 billion in 2018, an increase of 24% from 2017.
In his message to stakeholders in the report, ADB President Takehiko Nakao said that Strategy 2030 had energized ADB and positioned the Manila-based lender well to help countries in Asia and the Pacific cope with the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
“As our region continues to develop and transform, so too must ADB,” said Nakao. “Strategy 2030 provides us with a clear roadmap to meet the needs of our developing member countries (DMCs) and guide our operations for the next decade. We set out clear corporate targets to significantly increase operations, to build climate and disaster resilience, address gender equality, and mobilize long-term private financing.”
ADB continued to deliver on its climate commitments in 2018 with $3.6 billion in financing approved. ADB is on target to double its annual climate financing to $6 billion in approvals by 2020.

"Gold slips to Rs70,850 per tola ","
KARACHI (Dunya News) – Following decrease in gold rate in international market, the current rate of 24K per tola has reduced by Rs150 to Rs70,850.
Likewise, the gold rate 24K per 10 grams has reduced to Rs60,872 with the decrease of Rs130, whereas the rate of 22K gold per 10 grams has slipped to Rs55,681.
Moreover, the sliver rate sustained at Rs900 per tola.
On Tuesday, gold slipped for a fourth straight as recent upbeat economic data and signs that Washington and Beijing were making headway in a nearly year-long tariff skirmish boosted risk sentiment.
Better economic conditions stoke investors to pivot towards equities that are interest-bearing assets, and shun the non-yielding bullion.
Spot gold was down 0.2 percent at $1,285.39 per ounce, as of 0734 GMT. In the previous session, the bullion dropped to $1,281.96, its weakest since April 4.
U.S. gold futures shed 0.2 percent to $1,288.30 an ounce.
“The main reason what pressures gold is the improved economic data ... for countries such as China for example, things have turned around a fair bit,” said analyst Dominic Schneider of UBS Wealth Management in Hong Kong.
China reported better-than-expected credit and export figures last week that allayed concerns regarding the pace of economic growth.
Jobs data from the United States last week also lifted sentiment, assuaging concerns that the largest economy was losing momentum. Data showed the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a 49-1/2-year low.
Asian stocks were close to a nine-month peak on increasing expectations that the Chinese economy would stabilise.
“Equity markets are trading on an even keel, while optimism about a U.S.-China trade deal continues to be very supportive for risk sentiment completely deflating investor appetite for safe-haven plays like gold,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading and market strategy, SPI Asset Management.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told Fox Business Network on Monday trade negotiations between Washington and its Chinese counterparts were “making a lot of progress”.
Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, on Monday dropped to 754.03 tonnes, their lowest since Nov. 9, 2018.
“The other element that pressures gold is the 10-year (yields) in the U.S., which, despite easing yesterday, has been creeping up a bit from its March lows,” Schneider added.
Markets now await key Eurozone and Chinese data, which will provide further clues on the global economic health.
A Reuters poll has meanwhile suggested that despite China’s first-quarter economic growth likely cooling to the weakest pace in at least 27 years, recent stimulus measures would lift the economic mood in the future.
Among other metals, silver dipped 0.2 percent to $14.97 an ounce, having touching a trough since end-December at $14.81 in the previous session.
Spot platinum gained 0.6 percent to $890.63 per ounce, while palladium rose 0.3 percent to $1,365.05 per ounce.

"Oil extends losses into second session; Russia, OPEC output in focus","
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Oil prices edged down on Tuesday after a Russian minister said the nation and OPEC may boost crude output to fight for market share, checking a recent sharp rally driven by tighter global production.
Brent crude oil futures were at $71.08 a barrel at 0111 GMT, down 10 cents, or 0.1 percent, from their last close. Brent ended down 0.5 percent on Monday.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $63.39 per barrel, down 2 cents, or 0.1 percent, from their previous settlement. WTI fell 0.8 percent on Monday.
Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said over the weekend that Russia and OPEC may decide to boost production to fight for market share with the United States, but this would push oil as low as $40 per barrel.
“There is a growing concern that Russia will not agree on extending production cuts and we could see them officially abandon it in the coming months,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst, OANDA.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, known as OPEC+, will meet in June to decide whether to continue withholding supply. That comes after they previously agreed to crimp output by 1.2 million barrels per day from Jan. 1 for six months.
Losses were checked by tighter supplies from Iran and Venezuela amid signs the United States will further toughen sanctions on those two OPEC producers, and on the threat that renewed fighting could wipe out crude production in Libya.

Gas theft worth Rs48 billion should be stopped: Ghiyas Paracha ,"
KARACHI (Dunya News) – All Pakistan CNG Association (APCNGA) on Monday said the load of Rs65 billion suffered on account of sale of LNG should not be recovered from consumers.
The losses include loss of Rs36 billion in the sale of LNG, Rs26 billion didn’t recovered from the domestic consumers on account of gas supplies from Dec 2018 to Feb 2019 and delayed payments from consumers which added to the bank interest.
Speaking at a public hearing by OGRA in Lahore, the central leader of APCNGA Ghiyas Paracha said that recovery of all the losses from CNG and other sector is unjustified and unacceptable.
He said that gas worth Rs48 billion is being stolen of which 93 percent is stolen in the district of Karak in which gas officials are also involved. If gas utilities accord proper attention to the issue it can be resolved in a few months while we are also ready to cooperate in this regard.
Pointing out the weakness in the gas billing and measurements he said that gas utilities are overcharging consumers on account of GCV and gas mix while there is a lack of check and balance.
Ghiyas Paracha said that SNGPL has demanded Rs723 per mmbtu increase in gas tariff and Rs111 per mmbtu increase in LNG tariff which if accepted will make it very expensive discouraging buyers.
He said that the volume of gas continues to increase but the charges of gas distributors are not decreasing but continue to increase which is against the phenomena.
The leader of the CNG sector said that payment for post terminal expanses like regasification, transportation, and UFG should be made in the rupee and not the dollar.
He hoped that if his suggestions were accepted it will reduce the price of gas instead on an increase.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-15-19/news_big_images/487151_45536097.jpg,business,He hoped that if his suggestions were accepted it will reduce the price of gas instead on an increase.,neutral

"US, Japan kick off trade talks amid China deal optimism","
TOKYO (AFP) - As optimism grows that the United States and China are nearing a trade deal, Japan kicks off its own negotiations with Washington from Monday, hoping to resolve some of the issues ""very quickly.""
US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Japan’s Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi are set to embark on two days of talks in Washington.
In Tokyo last week, Motegi predicted the crunch talks would be ""candid"", with the first round on Monday about ""making a decision on which areas we will discuss, chiefly in the field of goods"".
""I will do my best to have thorough discussions so as to produce a good result in line with our national interest,"" said Motegi.
Self-styled dealmaker Donald Trump has been playing hardball with traditional US trading partners, using tariffs and threats in an effort to boost US exports and curb Washington’s longstanding trade deficit.
In May, Trump ordered his administration to investigate the possibility of imposing tariffs of up to 25 percent on foreign autos and auto parts, a prospect that alarmed the industry and could have serious repercussions for Japan and Europe.
The US president has frequently complained that Japan has an unfair advantage in bilateral trade and vowed to fix that.

‘Very quick agreement’

US Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said Thursday he was seeking a ""very quick agreement"" with Japan on tariff cuts for agricultural goods.
""I hope we can come to a very quick agreement with Japan over maybe some temporary ... provisions and hash out the many other issues that take longer in this area,"" Perdue told reporters in Washington, Kyodo News and the business daily Nikkei reported.
However, the US side is likely to run into opposition from Japan on this issue, Jiji Press reported, citing unnamed government sources.
""There’s no way for us to conclude an agricultural deal first,"" a senior Japanese official told Jiji.
If Japan does so, it may violate World Trade Organization rules related to free-trade agreements, the officials noted, according to the report.
Tokyo is expected to counter with demands that the United States scrap tariffs on Japanese industrial goods, if Washington urges an early opening of Japanese agricultural markets.
Tokyo aims to focus only on tariff matters, describing the talks as ""TAG"" or trade agreement on goods.
However, Washington trade officials have spelled out 22 specific negotiation areas also including non-tariff barriers in Japan’s auto market and currency.
US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Saturday any agreement will include a requirement to refrain from manipulating currencies to gain an advantage in international trade.
Golf buddies Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will have plenty of opportunities to talk trade in the coming months.
Abe is visiting the United States later this month and Trump is expected in Japan in May to pay his respects to the country’s new emperor who will take the throne on May 1.

Zuckerberg has drawn a base salary of $1 for the past three years, and his “other” compensation was listed at $22.6 million, most of which was for his personal security.
Nearly $20 million went towards security for Zuckerberg and his family, up from about $9 million the year prior. Zuckerberg also received $2.6 million for personal use of private jets, which the company said was part of his overall security programme.
Facebook has in the past few years faced public outcry over its role in Russia’s alleged influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election and has come under fire following revelations that Cambridge Analytica obtained personal data from millions of Facebook profiles without consent. 
Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg took home $23.7 million in 2018 compared to $25.2 million last year.
Separately, Facebook said Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings would vacate his seat on the social media company’s board and not be nominated for re-election.
Hastings’ departure comes as the Menlo Park-based company beefs up its push into videos. Hastings has served on Facebook’s board since 2011.
The company also said it would nominate PayPal’s senior vice president of core markets, Peggy Alford, to its board in place of University of North Carolina President Emeritus Erskine Bowles, who will also not be re-nominated.
Facebook shares closed at $179.07 Friday evening.

Zimbabwe prevail in rain-affected thriller to seal clean-sweep,"
HARARE (Agencies) - Zimbabwe eased home by three wickets against United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the fourth ODI between the sides at the Harare Sports Club to confirm a series whitewash.
Chasing 176, the hosts initially made excellent progress, racing to 37/0 inside seven overs before rain reduced the target to 128 in 30 overs. After the interval they found progress tougher going, with Brian Chari dismissed for 19 in the ninth over, slashing Mohammad Naveed aerially to Imran Haider at third man.
Naveed dismissed Zimbabwe’s other opener in his very next over, bowling Regis Chakabva with a perfect yorker. Sean Williams and Craig Ervine dragged Zimbabwe to 79/2, but three wickets in four balls gave the tourists the ascendancy. Zahoor Khan nicked off Ervine before Rohan Mustafa bowled each of Williams and new man PJ Moor.
Timycen Maruma’s cameo was crucial. He smashed 35 off 20 balls, at one point hitting Mustafa for two fours and a six in three balls, and then striking Haider for a four and a six in consecutive balls. His dismissal, bowled by Shaiman Anwar, saw Zimbabwe’s nerves resurface, with Ryan Burl and Sikandar Raza scoring one run in eight balls before the former was run out after being sent back. But the damage had been done, and two boundaries in four balls saw them seal a three-wicket win with time to spare.
UAE could take heart from their effort with the ball, but were left too much to do after another lacklustre batting effort. They had been given a strong platform by Chirag Suri and CP Rizwan, who helped them up to 91/2. But each was dismissed short of their half-centuries, and no one was able to provide a final flourish.
Muhammad Usman chipped in with a 24-ball 27, but on the whole Zimbabwe kept things tight, with Williams proving especially economical, rattling through 10 overs to finish with 2/27. UAE’s 175 never looked like enough, and hard though they fought, it proved to be the case.

Archer selection would be morally unfair: Woakes,"
LONDON (AFP) - Jofra Archer may be an exciting prospect, but fast-tracking him into England s provisional World Cup squad on Wednesday would not ""be fair morally"", said fellow paceman Chris Woakes.
Barbados-born Archer -- described by England all-rounder Ben Stokes as the most ""naturally-gifted"" bowler he has seen -- became eligible for England earlier this year.
The 24-year-old Sussex bowler -- whose father is English -- was the only high-level player to benefit when the England and Wales Cricket Board decided in November to alter residency rules.
Previously, players who entered the UK after turning 18 needed to live in the country for seven years to be eligible for England, but the ECB reduced that to three years. Archer arrived in 2015.
Woakes told BBC Sport that England, the top-ranked one-day-international team, have become close under captain Eoin Morgan as they prepared for the World Cup which gets underway in England at the end of May.
""It probably wouldn t be fair, morally, but at the same time it s the nature of international sport,"" said Woakes.
""If he was to come in and someone was to miss out, it would be extremely unfortunate.
""We ve been a tight-knit group for the last two to three years, played some really strong cricket, won a lot of series.
""I wouldn t want to see any of my mates and team-mates miss out.""
But the all-rounder insisted that England would remain focused on the job at hand should Archer get a call-up.
""I don t think it would disrupt the team, because everyone would find a way to move on and we re trying to win a World Cup for England. That s the bigger picture,"" added the 30-year-old.
Archer, who is playing in the IPL for the Rajasthan Royals, has appeared in just 14 one-day matches as a professional, but England coach Trevor Bayliss has said the all-rounder will feature in the ODIs against Ireland and Pakistan in May.
Other England pace bowlers have also expressed doubts.
David Willey said in March he did not know ""whether someone should just walk in at the drop of a hat because they re available"".
Mark Wood said last week that selecting Archer risked changing the ""dynamic"" of the side.

Pak woman cricketer Diana ruled out of South Africa tour,"
LAHORE (APP) – Seventeen-year-old pace bowler Fatima Sana has been included in Pakistan women team that will tour South Africa in place of pace bowler Diana Baig, who underwent a surgery on her injured left thumb on Tuesday.
Diana has been advised eight to ten weeks rest following the surgery at Karachi and she has been ruled out of Pakistan’s tour of South Africa that begins from Monday, 29 April. Diana got injured during a training session in Karachi on Monday, where the South Africa bound squad is preparing for the tour.
Chief selector Pakistan women team Urooj Mumtaz on Tuesday expressed her disappointment at Diana’s injury she added that the tour of South Africa provides a good opportunity for Fatima to prove her worth.
“It was unfortunate that Diana fractured her left thumb during practice yesterday. Thankfully the surgery was a success and I wish her a speedy recovery. Diana has been replaced by Fatima Sana, a young promising fast bowler and I wish her all the best,” she said.
Fatima took seven wickets in as many games in the recently concluded 2nd Inter-Departmental T20 Women’s Cricket Championship 2019 that was held in Islamabad.
Hyderabad-born Fatima represented ZTBL in the tournament. Diana will now undergo a rehabilitation programme under the supervision of National Cricket Academy’s medical panel.

"Uncapped Jayed, recalled Mosaddek in Bangladesh World Cup squad","
DHAKA (Reuters) - Rookie swing bowler Abu Jayed earned a spot in Bangladesh’s World Cup squad on Tuesday while batsman Mosaddek Hossain also made the cut for the showpiece tournament in England and Wales.
Right-arm paceman Jayed, who has played five tests but has yet to debut in ODIs, was picked for his ability to swing the ball as he demonstrated in the two-test series in New Zealand.
“In New Zealand, we saw that he could swing the ball. His bowling can be effective in English conditions,” chief selector Minhajul Abedin told reporters in Mirpur after naming the 15-member squad led by all-rounder Mashrafe Mortaza.
Jayed’s selection came at the expense of fellow paceman Taskin Ahmed, who missed the Zealand tour with an ankle injury. “Taskin played his last ODI in October 2017 and it’s been a long break for him,” Minhajul said.
Mosaddek, who last played for Bangladesh in the Asia Cup in September, returned as a back-up all-round option as Mahmudullah nurses a shoulder injury. “We have some injury concerns for Mahmudullah. Most probably he will not be able to bowl. That’s why we have considered Mosaddek as a back-up,” Minhajul said. “He can bowl off-spin which can be a great asset for us in an event like World Cup.”
Apart from Mahmudullah, the pace duo of Mustafizur Rahman and Rubel Hossain were also named in the squad despite injury concerns. Mustafizur has not fully recovered from an ankle problem, while Rubel is nursing a side strain.
All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan has been named Mortaza’s deputy while Mushfiqur Rahim is the wicketkeeper. Bangladesh begin their campaign against South Africa at the Oval in London on June 2. New Zealand, Australia and India have already announced their squads and others must follow suit by April 23. Injury replacements can be named until May 23.

(Reuters) - All-rounder Vijay Shankar is making the most of his presence in a Sunrisers Hyderabad camp which also contains a couple of World Cup winners after being selected in India’s 15-member squad for the showpiece tournament in England and Wales.
The Tamil Nadu all-rounder was picked on Monday as India’s number four batsman whose seam bowling expertise could also be useful in English conditions.
“We have a few World Cup winning team members here at Sunrisers Hyderabad and I have spoken to them to understand what it feels like to play in a World Cup and then go on to win it,” Shankar said in a Hyderabad news release.
The Indian Premier League (IPL) side have opening batsman David Warner and coach Tom Moody who have both won the World Cup with Australia.
“I have learnt a lot from them on the ways to manage pressure at such a large scale event,” Shankar said. “I’m extremely elated to be in the Indian World Cup team, this is like a dream come true.”
Hyderabad team mate Bhuvneshwar Kumar has also been selected and the 29-year-old medium pacer, known for his ability to swing the ball both ways, hopes to thrive in English conditions.
“The conducive English conditions will suit my strength and I’m looking to make the most of it,” Kumar said. “This is my second World Cup and now I’m pretty confident to perform at such a level.
“Playing for Sunrisers in the IPL has given me the right match practice just before the mega tournament.”

Pakistan appoints Rohail Nazir U19 captain for Sri Lanka tour,"
LAHORE (Web Desk) – Rohail Nazir, who scored a century on his first-class debut this season, has been appointed as Pakistan U19 captain for next month’s series against Sri Lanka, the Pakistan Cricket Board announced today.
Wicketkeeper/batsman Rohail scored 130 and four for Islamabad against Habib Bank Limited in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy in September. He played three more first-class matches in his debut season and finished with 300 runs besides dismissing 13 batsmen behind the wickets.
Rohail was Hassan Khan’s vice-captain in the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup 2018 in New Zealand where Pakistan finished third after their third-fourth place play-off against Afghanistan was abandoned without a ball being bowled. Rohail finished the tournament with 140 runs and 14 dismissals, and later went on to captain Pakistan U19 in the ACC U19 Asia Cup in September/October 2018.
Mohammad Taha, who was also part of the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup 2018 squad, has been appointed as vice-captain. Taha, a left-handed top-order batsman, scored 54 runs in five matches in New Zealand and is yet to make his first-class debut.
Faisalabad’s wrist spinner Suleman Shafqat is the other member from the World Cup squad to retain a place in the Sri Lanka touring party. He took three wickets in New Zealand.
Apart from Rohail, the only other first-class cricketer in the 15-player squad is FATA’s fast bowler Abbas Afridi, who has played two matches and taken four wickets.
Saim Ayub is the other notable cricketer to find a place in the side. The left-hander had previously captained Pakistan U16 on the tour to Australia in April 2018 and was also part of the side that featured in the ACC U19 Asia Cup last year in Bangladesh.
Keeping in mind the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup 2020 in South Africa, the junior selection committee headed by Basit Ali has selected players who were born on or after 1 September 2000 so that they remain eligible for next year’s global event to be played from 17 January to 9 February 2020.
Pakistan U19 will play two four-day matches against Sri Lanka U19 in Galle (3-6 May) and Hambantota (9-12 May), before taking on Sri Lanka U19 in three 50-over matches in Hambantota (15 and 17 May) and Galle (20 May).

PCB partners with British Asian Trust to transform mental health in Pakistan,"
LAHORE (Web Desk) – The Pakistan Cricket Board, as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility, today announced a three-year partnership with the prestigious British Asian Trust with an aim to further strengthen support for their mental health programme in Pakistan.
In doing so, the Pakistan cricket team has become the first cricket team to partner with a charity in this way, therefore, showcasing a new way of giving back and making a difference.
The British Asian Trust has been supporting mental health programmes in Pakistan since 2011 and scaled up this work substantially in 2018. It helps to transform the situation for people with mental health issues in Pakistan, working with local partners to develop services, train specialists, reduce stigma and change public perceptions.
According to the World Health Organisation statistics, one in four people will be affected by mental health disorders in their lifetime – accounting for more than 50 million people in Pakistan. Yet, there are fewer than 400 psychiatrists and 500 psychologists in the country to support them as well as widespread stigma attached to speaking openly about personal mental health and wellbeing.
PCB Managing Director, Wasim Khan, said: “We are delighted to be partnering with the British Asian Trust in what will be a ground breaking partnership.
“Driven by our values, we believe cricket has a huge role to play as both a catalyst for change and as a force for good. The work of the British Asian Trust within Pakistan has made a huge difference in supporting mental health and wellbeing amongst some of our most vulnerable people.”
The partnership will shine a light on the issue of mental health in Pakistan, helping people understand there are services available to support individuals and families, and encouraging them to speak out and seek help.
The Pakistan cricket players and staff will also visit local projects in Pakistan so they can find out about the work being done in country as well as meeting with individuals and families affected by mental health issues.
The British Asian Trust galvanises the commitment and passion of the Pakistani diaspora to support their programmes in mental health, education and livelihoods. They have major projects working to provide jobs for women and young people.
The British Asian Trust works with the government, civil society and the private sector and invests in the best local partners to create lasting, meaningful change. Their work is spearheaded by an in-country team and is guided by the strategic insights and expertise of the Pakistan Advisory Council.
Mr Wasim Khan added: “Mental health remains a taboo subject in Pakistan; having personally visited a mental health project in a poor area in Karachi, I have seen first-hand the difference that resources and skilled practitioners can make on the ground.
“As the PCB, we have an opportunity to play our part in raising awareness of this important cause. The lack of education and understanding means that the condition goes undetected; which can have a devastating impact on the quality of life for both the individuals and their families.
“Like many countries, the taboo surrounding mental health problems means that hundreds of thousands of citizens don’t receive treatment, or any kind of support. We as the PCB believe it is important that we use our standing in Pakistan society to stand up and encourage people to seek help.
“The funds raised at the dinner in London on 25 April will be spent on helping to build and expand on the great work already being done in places like Karachi.
“We look forward to building on this work for years to come.”

'Mix and match' - Australia to rotate openers after Warner return,"
SYDNEY (AFP) – Australian coach Justin Langer on Tuesday welcomed the top-order selection dilemma posed by the return of David Warner as offering ""fantastic flexibility"" to the team ahead of the World Cup.
The return of Steve Smith and Warner from their year-long bans for ball-tampering has left selectors in a quandary, with openers Aaron Finch and Usman Khawaja building a formidable partnership in recent one-day internationals.
Warner has been in blistering touch in the Indian Premier League and typically opens the batting.
But Langer on Tuesday said it was a welcome problem to have all three potential openers firing.
""We have amazing flexibility now,"" he told Melbourne radio SEN.
""Usman and Finchy have done an incredible job opening the batting. David and Finchy have done a great job in the past doing it,"" he added.
Langer said he would ""mix and match"" the top order in matches leading up to the World Cup.
""I love the flexibility of it. (It’s about) boys playing their roles for the team not just playing the roles that suit them,"" he said.
Australia named their World Cup squad on Monday with middle order batsman Peter Handscomb ""brutally unlucky"" to have to make way for Smith.
""Steve Smith we felt would probably be able to play that role that Pete has done so well for us,"" Langer said.
The decision to drop Handscomb also means the team only has one wicketkeeper in Alex Carey.
But Langer said Tim Paine, Matthew Wade and Handscomb, all named in one of Australia’s two A squads which will play in England later this year, were on standby if Carey was injured.
""Usually wicketkeepers, they give up their spot for no-one. They have to do a pretty serious injury to move aside for someone else,"" he said.
""And Alex Carey he is elite-fit and is as tough as they come. But if something does happen then we will have someone there to replace them."" ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-16-19/news_big_images/487225_49555424.jpg,Cricket,"""Steve Smith we felt would probably be able to play that role that Pete has done so well for us,"" Langer said.",positive
Ex-cricketer Lewis on long walk back from disgrace to redemption,"
BASINGSTOKE (AFP) - Chris Lewis s journey from opening the bowling for England in the 1992 World Cup final to contemplating suicide and being convicted of drugs smuggling has him feeling as ambitious as when he was a teenager, he has told AFP.
The 51-year-old -- who represented England over 80 times in Tests and one-day internationals -- said it was fear over being penniless that drove him to smuggle 140,000 pound ($183,000) of cocaine in cans of fruit into England from St Lucia in 2008.
He stood to earn 50,000 pound from the deal -- instead he ended up serving six and a half years of a 13-year prison term.
The engaging and lithe former all-rounder is presently touring with the play written by Dougie Blaxland (the pen name of former cricketer James Graham-Brown) about his life called ""A Long Walk Back"".
""Do you know, the funny thing is I would suggest I am more ambitious and more optimistic than I have ever been in my life,"" Lewis told AFP in an interview conducted at the Haymarket Theatre in Basingstoke.
""This is a stage of my life I should have gone through in my 20s with a whole set of new experiences.
""It is a place I have not been since I was a teenager... a place when that teenage boy was dreaming of being a cricketer.""
The play, directed by Australian husband and wife Shane Morgan and Moira Hunt of the Bristol-based Roughhouse Theatre, has helped re-light the fire within him.
""It (the play) all comes together from an idea of how we have reached here when less than a decade ago I was sat in a prison cell and my life was more than over,"" Lewis said.
It is a far cry from when Lewis, whose long-term girlfriend Patricia stayed loyal despite him putting her  through the wars , contemplated taking his own life on the first night he was incarcerated after his arrest.
""You cannot get over the prospect of facing a sentence of 15 years,"" he said. ""If you have not been in jail it seems an unimaginable amount of time.
""The question of  if this goes the wrong way what will you do  and (suicide) was certainly something on the table.
""It is ironic that after being sentenced to 13 years that did not occur to me.""
Lewis, whose morale was greatly helped by former Surrey team-mate Jason Ratcliffe who offered him help from the start, largely kept himself to himself in prison.
""A strange thing that happened was sitting on my bed the night after the sentence had been passed and I cried and it got a lot of emotions out,"" he said.
""After I had done crying that night I had no need to cry again.
""In terms of the cell... let us say if you like the fragrance of someone else - the toilet is right next to the bed - there are some people who may put up with that because they want company.
""I was more the other way I wanted to be on my own having some control of one s environment and keep your room a certain way.""
There were certain rules that Lewis imposed on himself from the start of his jail term -- neither listening to music nor telling his adored grandmother Eunice Joseph back in Guyana about his fall from grace.
""I stopped listening to music immediately because a certain tune can take you back to a particular moment,"" he said.
""My mum (Patricia) and aunts took the decision not to tell my grandmother who was very proud of me and I wholeheartedly agreed with it.
""I would ring her from prison and ensured every Christmas that one of my brothers would send her money from me so she would think everything was normal.
""Sadly she was pretty sick at the time, bedridden, and died while I was inside,"" he says, his voice choking with emotion.
In the play, Lewis takes part in a question and answer session with the audience, fielding sometimes awkward enquiries.
He says he is pleased by the play -- which has included two prisons on its tour -- because it explores the emotional side of his story and the battle he had to accept who was to blame for his predicament.
""It was not immediate but eventually I came to the conclusion the person who has the final say in stuff that happened in your life is me.
""It is hard then to start to point the finger without pointing it backwards.""

Poor form puts Amla's World Cup place in jeopardy,"
JOHANNESBURG (AFP) - South Africa s selectors will reveal on Thursday whether veteran batsman Hashim Amla will be part of the country s squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.
Amla, 36, is one of South Africa s all-time great one-day international players but his recent form has been poor, while increasing age has meant that he has slowed down in the field.
Amla scored only 51 runs in four innings in South Africa s shock Test series loss against Sri Lanka earlier this year and did not play in the first three one-day internationals against the tourists, although Cricket South Africa stressed he had not been dropped.
He was due to play the final two one-day games against Sri Lanka but withdrew because his father was seriously ill.
After more than a month out of cricket, Amla returned for the Cape Cobras franchise in a domestic Twenty20 competition in early April but his first three matches yielded only 28 runs.
He showed signs of promise for the Cobras on Sunday with an innings of 32 -- his joint-highest score in any form of cricket since a one-day series against Pakistan in January.
With captain Faf du Plessis, Quinton de Kock, Rassie van der Dussen, David Miller and JP Duminy all seemingly certain of selection, there is probably room for only two more top-order batsmen in a 15-man squad.
Amla s rivals, Aiden Markram and Reeza Hendricks, have both been in good recent form, with Hendricks named man-of-the-series in the recent Twenty20 series against Sri Lanka after a poor one-day series had seemingly scuttled his chances.
Markram and Hendricks are outstanding fielders.
The other big debate ahead of the squad announcement is the identity of a back-up fast bowler to the likely trio of Kagiso Rabada, Dale Steyn and Lungi Ngidi.
Newcomer Anrich Nortje was impressive in the one-day series against Sri Lanka and although he was forced to withdraw from the Indian Premier League with a shoulder injury he is expected to be fit for the World Cup.
While he has not played in a one-day international since February last year, Chris Morris has been picked by several experts in their preferred World Cup squads because he can bowl at more than 140 kph and is a hard-hitting lower-order batsman.
Three wickets for the Delhi Capitals against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Sunday took his total to 11 in six matches in this year s IPL.
Andile Phehlukwayo and Dwaine Pretorius are likely to be picked as all-rounders, while Imran Tahir and Tabraiz Shamsi are South Africa s probable spin bowlers.
It is unlikely that a back-up wicketkeeper to De Kock will be chosen, with Miller seemingly being groomed as an emergency gloveman.

Beyonce drops another surprise album,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - Beyonce, the queen of surprise and so much else, has again dropped a record with no warning: a live album to go with an upcoming Netflix documentary on her performance at Coachella last year.
The album entitled ""Homecoming,"" just like the film, was released in the early hours of Wednesday across all major streaming platforms, including Apple Music, Spotify and Google Play.
It breaks that more than two-hour performance -- she actually took to the stage twice last year at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival -- into 40 tracks.
Beyonce was the first black woman to headline the festival.
Her set paid tribute to the musical heritage of historically black American colleges and she was backed up by dozens of dancers and a marching band.
Beyonce first dropped an album without warning in 2013: the record ""Beyonce"" suddenly appeared in the iTunes music store with no advance notice.
And she has repeated the tactic since then with albums like ""Lemonade"" and ""Everything is Love.""

Russian director wins top awards after release from house arrest,"
MOSCOW (AFP) - Russian director Kirill Serebrennikov has won the country’s top theatre awards a week after he was released from a more than year-long house arrest pending his trial on embezzlement charges.
The 49-year-old, who was forced to miss the Cannes Premiere of his acclaimed film ""Summer"" last year, has long denounced the case against him as ""absurd"".
He continued working remotely since his detention in August 2017 and late Tuesday he was announced as winner of the Golden Mask prizes for best drama director and best ballet.
""I hope you gave me this award because you really liked the play,"" Serebrennikov said in his acceptance speech, to some laughter from the audience.
""I hope the theatre community will also give each other support, like it supports me,"" he said, according to footage broadcast by independent channel TV Rain.
The play, ""Little Tragedies,"" a modern take on classic works by Alexander Pushkin, premiered in the theatre Serebrennikov heads, Gogol Center, after his arrest in August 2017. Work on it had to be finished without him.
In a surprise decision last Monday, a Moscow court ordered his release from house arrest but said he must remain in the capital as the hearing of his case continues.
The director and three of his co-defendants are accused of creating an organised criminal group and embezzling more than $2 million (1.75 million euros) of state funding for a theatre project called Platforma.
He has insisted the money was used legitimately. This week the court ordered a second assessment of the project’s finances and artistic merit for the case, reports said.
Serebrennikov also collected the ballet prize for the Bolshoi’s controversial ""Nureyev"".
The ballet, based on the life of Russian dance legend Rudolf Nureyev, was pulled just days before its original premiere set for May 2017, but was performed later that year.
Bolshoi management cited an under-rehearsed cast for the delay but speculation swirled that it had been pulled because of the investigation into the director, or the ballet’s treatment of Nureyev’s homosexuality.
Serebrennikov’s detention sent shockwaves through the Russian arts world and his case became a cause celebre in the West.  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-17-19/news_big_images/487413_55028567.jpg,entertainment,He continued working remotely since his detention in August 2017 and late Tuesday he was announced as winner of the Golden Mask prizes for best drama director and best ballet.,positive

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The directors of “Avengers: Endgame” pleaded with fans on Tuesday not to spoil the movie by giving away storylines after reports that some scenes had leaked online.

In an open letter posted on Twitter under the hashtag #DontSpoilTheEndgame, Joe and Anthony Russo said they and the vast cast of the upcoming Marvel superhero movie “have worked tirelessly for the last three years with the sole intention of delivering a surprising and emotionally powerful conclusion” to the saga.

Walt Disney Co’s “Avengers: Endgame” marks the conclusion of a story told across 22 Marvel films. The plot has been shrouded in secrecy, with no advance screenings for the entertainment press. Sales of advance tickets earlier this month surpassed those of 2015 movie “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

The film, which brings together multiple comic book characters, starts its rollout on April 24 in Australia and China before arriving in the United States on April 25.

Record 17.4 million watch 'Game of Thrones' kickoff for final season,"
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Some 17.4 million Americans watched the first episode of the final season of television’s “Game of Thrones” - a record audience for the mediaeval fantasy series, cable channel HBO said on Monday.

HBO said Sunday’s live U.S. television audience and viewers on its HBO GO and HBO NOW apps exceeded the previous series high of 16.9 million viewers for the Season 7 finale two years ago.

On social media, Sunday’s premiere was also the most-tweeted-about episode of the show ever, with more than 5 million Tweets, and 11 million mentions throughout the course of the weekend, HBO said in a statement.

All of the top 10 global Twitter trends late Sunday evening were about the episode.

The series set among warring families in the fictional kingdom of Westeros, which began in 2007, has become HBO’s biggest hit.

Season 7 averaged 32.8 million U.S. viewers per episode when delayed viewing was counted and HBO said it expected the Season 8 average to “grow considerably”.

“Game of Thrones” is available in over 150 countries worldwide, but HBO said viewing data is not easily retrieved in many of those markets, making a global figure impossible to calculate.

Details of the final season have been kept a closely guarded secret, boosting anticipation.

The most-tweeted moment from Sunday’s show came when popular “Thrones” character Jon Snow (played by Kit Harington) learned the truth about his parents, and the fact that his love interest, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), is in fact his aunt.

Despite its avid fan base, “Game of Thrones” is far from the biggest television event in the United States. The annual NFL Super Bowl attracts about 100 million viewers and the 2019 Oscars ceremony in February was watched on television by 29.6 million Americans.

NEW YORK (AFP) - American actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, accused of paying a $500,000 bribe to secure their daughters’ entry into a prestigious California university, on Monday pleaded not guilty to money laundering charges.
The couple waived their right to appear before a judge to be formally accused and entered their pleas through documents filed by their attorneys, according to documents seen by AFP.
""Full House"" star Loughlin and her husband, designer Mossimo Giannulli, were among the 50 people -- including ""Desperate Housewives"" star Felicity Huffman -- indicted in the wide-ranging college bribery scandal.
Huffman pleaded guilty to paying $15,000 to boost her daughter’s SAT college entrance exam score.
Loughlin, 54, and Giannulli are accused of paying $500,000 in 2016 and 2017 so that their two daughters could gain entrance into the University of Southern California (USC) by posing as members of the rowing team.
Their charges of money laundering and bank fraud carry a penalty of up to 40 years in prison.
The ringleader behind the college admissions scam, William ""Rick"" Singer, who authorities say was paid about $25 million to bribe coaches and university administrators, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with authorities.
Besides USC, some of the universities targeted in the elaborate cheating scam include Yale, Stanford, UCLA and Georgetown. None of the schools or the students have been charged in the case.
According to prosecutors, the accused parents paid a firm run by Singer to cheat on college entrance exams for their children or to bribe coaches to help non-athletic students get scholarships. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/April/04-16-19/news_big_images/487194_51102256.jpg,entertainment,"The ringleader behind the college admissions scam, William ""Rick"" Singer, who authorities say was paid about $25 million to bribe coaches and university administrators, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with authorities.",negative

It's written in the stars - Meghan's royal baby will be bold,"
(REUTERS) - Boy or girl, Prince Harry and his American wife Meghan s first child will be bold and courageous, and Harry will be the more patient parent, according to a U.S. astrologer.
If, as royal watchers expect, Meghan gives birth in late April or the first week of May, the baby will be born under the zodiac sign of Taurus, the bull.
But some fiery astrology elements are also in play. Jupiter is in the midst of its transit into Sagittarius, while Venus will enter Aries next week, Los Angeles astrologer Charis Milona told Reuters.
‘There s a great fiery line-up,’said Milona after consulting her astrology charts. ‘We are looking at the child being born with a lot of extroverted, fiery, courageous, superstar sparkle components.’
Harry and Meghan, whose official titles are Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have not given an expected due date although Meghan told British well-wishers on a visit in January that she was six months pregnant. The couple said last week they had decided to keep their plans around the baby s arrival private.
Milona, who also reads tarot cards at the Psychic Eye Book Shop in suburban Los Angeles, said that although Meghan was born in August under the zodiac sign Leo, her ascendant at the time of her birth was Cancer. Harry, a Virgo born in September, has Capricorn rising, she said.
‘She is like the perfect mother, very nurturing. He is the perfect father (with) responsibility, very honorable,’ Milona said. ‘But what I noticed in the charts is that as parents, Prince Harry will actually have more patience than Meghan.’
Milona said that Meghan, a former actress on the U.S. television series ""Suits"" who married Harry in May 2018, would have made an impression whatever she did because she also has the sun in her own Leo zodiac sign.
‘She shines a very bright light, especially having the sun in the first house of her self,’  she said. ‘So it wouldn t have mattered what she became in life.’ She would be noticed.
‘Fire means you walk into a room and a great light just got turned on, and she is the star.’
